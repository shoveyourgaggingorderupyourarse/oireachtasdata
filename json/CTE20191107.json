He is joined by Ms Geraldine Mooney, deputy director of audit.  <\/p> <p>  We have received no apologies for this meeting.  The first item on the agenda is the minutes of the meeting of 24 October - we had no meeting last week - together with the follow-up questions sent to the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  Are the minutes agreed to?  Agreed.<\/p> <p>  The next item on the agenda is correspondence.  The first items, Nos. 2513 and 2525, are correspondence received from the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, including briefing documentation and an opening statement for today's meeting.  We will note and publish the correspondence.  Is that agreed? Agreed.<\/p> <p>  Category B is correspondence received from Accounting Officers and\/or Ministers in follow-up on matters raised at meetings of the Committee of Public Accounts and other items for publication.  At our last meeting we agreed to hold over some items for consideration this week.  Items Nos. 2432 and 2465 are correspondence, dated 4 October 2019, received from from Ms Katherine Licken, Secretary General of the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, enclosing a copy of the post-project review mentioned and referred to in our previous periodic report on the Palace Cinema project in Galway.  I will make a number of brief observations.  <\/p> <p>  Recommendation No. 7 on page 3, with which I am sure members will agree - I will highlight some of the recommendations made in what I stress is a 35 page document - is that performance indicators should be established for all grants funded by the cultural division and that data should be collected and collated in a systemic manner.  This is a great recommendation, but in my view it does not grasp the point from the Committee of Public Accounts' point of view.  This is a project within a Department that went seriously over budget.  The Department's view is that within it there should be performance indicators within the cultural division.  That is unacceptable from the point of view of the Committee of Public Accounts.  Where mistakes like this have been made within a section in a Department, the lessons must be learned, not only within that section but also within the Department and across the public service.  We will be writing to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform as a result of this report to say it must put a system in place to ensure that in a case where lessons are learned, the results will not be pigeonholed in one cubbyhole in one section in one Department.  That is a method that ensures there will be no learning across the public service from mistakes that happen in particular areas.  The confining of the recommendation is not acceptable from the point of view of the Committee of Public Accounts.  <\/p> <p>  The Department also states there is to be a Department of Public Expenditure and Reform spending code update.  We will ask for a copy of it if it has been completed.  The reference is included at the bottom of page 3.  <\/p> <p>  Page 4 of the report essentially refers to the fact that the Committee of Public Accounts dealt with this issue in its periodic report and recommendations and that a post-project review was carried out as a result.  We are pleased that that has happened.  However, the Department has confined its learning from the mistakes to a very narrow section within it.  <\/p> <p>  On page 6 of the report - this is a theme that arises here every week - the Department states two independent reports were commissioned to examine the demand for cultural cinema in Ireland: the Neil Connolly and Maretta Dillon report in 2001 and the report produced by the English consultants Todd in 2004.  We are great at spending money in employing consultants.  There is no problem with employing a consultant, but when one has to come along a short time later and employ another to examine a closely related issue, that is where we consider no proper value for money is being achieved.  We had representatives of a State organisation here only a few weeks ago that essentially had four consultants looking at the same thing over a two-year period.  Our concern is the overuse of consultants.  Some may think we do not need them, but everybody can agree that our concern is their overuse.  <\/p> <p>  Table 5 on page 9 of the report deals with the original allocation of &euro;4.3 million for the project which ended up costing &euro;8.3 million.  The table shows where funding was received from various bodies.  When site costs are included, the project was originally projected to cost  &euro;6.26 million, but it ended up costing &euro;10.3 million.   Thast is a serious overrun.  <\/p> <p>  We have picked up on this project because the Comptroller and Auditor General highlighted it for us initially.  Paragraph 6.5 on page 15 of the report refers to the fifth departmental review carried out in 2018 of the various cost increases over a period of time.  It took five reviews to get to the end.  In his report the Comptroller and Auditor General outlined some of the issues at which the Department had looked.  My conclusion is that after so many reviews and consultants, the response of the Department has been to confine any learning to one narrow section within it.  That is a point I have already made.  There is to be no learning across the public sector on the issue.<\/p> <p>  Perhaps Deputy Connolly might like to add something.  We will publish this information today, if we have not already done so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019110700002#B00200","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1573117200,"counter":7,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman for that overview.

[That is of concern to me, regardless of whether the Department complied with it ]  The final assessment of this review considers that the main problem with the project was the fact that the original project promoters, while very well-intentioned and passionate about cinema, were not sufficiently skilled to manage a project as complex as P&aacute;l&aacute;s.  Solas had no demonstrable experience of operating a cinema or managing a large construction project ... [and there was a] lack of relevant experience.<\/blockquote> <p>Passion is great.  I am always giving out about a lack of passion and a lack of vision, so that is marvellous.  I want to take the focus off the people who came forward with passion and vision but who did not have the experience.  I will go to the Department, which saw that passion and vision, but did not match it with oversight.  In the sentence I have just quoted, I am being told the Department complied with what was in place at the time.  I have made notes on it.  I am almost about to give up.  On the one hand, the Department is saying it has learned something from it while , on the other, it is stating that it complied with what was in place at the time.<\/p><p>Another concern relates to the funding.  It has been suggested that the operator of the cinema was the second biggest contributor after the Department.  In fact, Galway City Council was the second biggest contributor because it donated the site, which was worth almost &euro;2 million, and it gave &euro;500,000 on top of that.  This is not even recognised in this review, which is a matter of great concern.<\/p><p>We knew generally at the time that there were problems with this project.  This is what is important.  How can projects go ahead if people, including lots of councillors, had concerns?  They were demonised and ostracised and told they were not wearing the Galway jersey.  This was the type of conversation that happened in respect of this project.  We were the ones who endorsed the project in the beginning.  We did so with vision.  As the problems emerged, we called for accountability.  Those who dared to ask questions were told they were not donning the jersey.  This is a problem that must be learnt by all public representatives.<\/p><p>Consider, also, the bespoke nature of the project.  Perhaps somebody could explain what that means. On page 22 of the review, it is stated:<\/p><blockquote>The bespoke design of the building, while architecturally significant and award-winning, does present Element Pictures with a number of challenges as operators.  The P&aacute;l&aacute;s cinema was designed by De Paor architects and has been described as a contemporary moulded-concrete &quot;tower house&quot;. [And the description of it is included] ... the facade may be somewhat intimidating to people and, as such, presents a barrier to entry.  Element Pictures [who have been left with this baby on their hands now] are working to make the interior as warm and inviting as possible and encourage the public to explore and experience the building.  The highly bespoke nature of the building added to the overall cost of the project and over the long-run means that upkeep and refurbishment of the building will be a costly undertaking, as there are a number of functionality issues that make the building less than optimal for its intended purpose.<\/blockquote> <p>The Department, which might as well be working for F&aacute;ilte Ireland, goes on to give all the advantages to the cinema - which we knew and that is why we have been promoting it - and tells us how important it is for the area of Galway and the cultural quarter.  It tells us that there are four houses at the site and that these will be artisan dwellings.  The Department does not mention, however, that these houses have been empty since the council purchased them in 2005 or 2006.  In a housing crisis, these four houses are empty, but that is not mentioned at all.<\/p><p>Five reviews were carried out.  Fair play to the Department - it was good and carried out the five reviews.  The reviews, however, were limited and each time they concluded that they had no choice but to go ahead and not have a hole in the ground.  They also tell a story that is not quite accurate with regard to the first contractor.  The review provided a list of reasons as to why there was a problem, one of which was the recession.  Earlier in the report, it cited the design problems, delays and other issues that led the builder to walk from the building.  It was not the recession.  I welcome the report, and it is a starting point, but we or the Comptroller and Auditor General need to go through it.<\/p><p>The promotion of Galway is unnecessary in this context.  It is not part of a project review.  Did we succeed?  Yes, we did.  The idea was to build, and we did build, but it was built over a period of 11 years at a cost of &euro;11 million, with a housing crisis in Galway and a failure to purchase a building across the road that was better value at &euro;450,000.  All along the way there were implications for the decision to continue.  Element Pictures are the operators now.  I wish the company the best and have always done so.  I have been in the building.  None of this is about personal views, it is about how we got to the stage where a project that was to cost much less ended up costing &euro;11 million.  It is about how there was no project manager.  Solas was offered a project manager by the Irish Film Board and refused to accept.  I am just mentioning some of the issues.  There is a list of notes, but I will not delay the meeting any longer.<\/p><p>This project raises so many questions and generally it raises very serious questions about the use of public funds in this manner.  There have been five reviews into the project that allowed more money to be paid out.  Within this there is also the city council that gave a site worth &euro;2 million and gave another &euro;500,000 even while there was a serious problem in Galway around lack of funds for serious issues.  I have gone out on a limb for the arts and I have read the arts reports for the committee.  This is not about arts versus something else, it is about making very sensible and practical decisions, with proper oversight from a Department.  That did not happen in this instance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019110700002#C00800","speaker":"1316"},{"type":"speech","time":1573117200,"counter":15,"content":"<p>Who carried out the review?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019110700002#C00900","speaker":"1346"},{"type":"speech","time":1573117200,"counter":16,"content":"<p>It would have been the Department.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019110700002#C01000","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1573117200,"counter":17,"content":"<p>On the cover, it gives the individual's name who is part of the evaluation unit in the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht.

It is a case of circle the wagons, nobody is to blame, nobody pays the price and Galway has a piece of infrastructure.  We are all proud of Galway's culture, heritage and the part it plays.  With every respect to Deputy Connolly, however, Galway does pretty well out of public funds when it comes to the arts.  As I said at the meeting when we first raised this, it is an abomination.  If it was the private sector, there would be disciplinary action and lay-offs, and whoever was responsible would have difficulty in getting into any kind of job in the future.  Yet here we have a report that says not only did it cost &euro;11 million, but we built this &euro;11 million building for a private sector project.<\/p><p>The building is so beautiful that people are frightened to go into it.  We will not be able to heat it.  It will cost a substantial amount of money to maintain it.  The building is to be operated for the profit of a different outfit at a preferential rent.  That is a disgrace.  It is endemic of what goes on in this room.  Whenever the State is involved, we put the car into the hedge but nobody pays the price.  We put it down to experience and state that we will know better next time.  Without tangible sanction for the endemic mediocrity of the apparatus of the State, this is going to happen again.  It is probably happening as we speak.  Without doubt, the same unit will use its training in the dark arts of circling the wagons and making a bunch of muck look like a bowl of ice cream.<\/p><p> This committee has to make a recommendation.  There must be tangible sanction when total incompetence is endemic to the extent that we have spent &euro;11 million for a private sector company to make profit and we have offered a preferential rent.  I have nothing against Galway and its great cultural prowess.  If we want to spend this &euro;11 million in Galway it would be better spent on light rail or public transport.  Galway has a traffic problem that is proportionately 100 times worse than that of Dublin, not to mention housing, health and other challenges.  It is a disgrace.  We cannot say it strongly enough.  This is a good example on a relatively small scale of what we happens on a massive scale with projects like the national children's hospital - we throw good money after bad.  The Taoiseach recently stated that the cost of the latter is heading towards &euro;2 billion.  The Deputy beside me has said it will cost more than that.  God knows who will be in this room to pick up the pieces when it is finished, or how many billions it will eventually cost.  The P&aacute;l&aacute;s Cinema must be seen as a classic example of the incompetence of the apparatus of the State and its inability to admit when it is wrong.  There must be tangible sanctions to deter such poor management practices in the future.  That tangible sanction is what is missing from the work of the State.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019110700002#C02000","speaker":"1346","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1573117200,"counter":28,"content":"<p>I will be very quick because the issues have been outlined well.  To find the origin of the problem we have to go back to the original decision rather than the reviews.  It was the same building before this started as it was when the reviews were carried out.  Over and over again we see a failure to anticipate or understand resource requirements.  It is all very well to carry out a review afterwards.  That is fine.  The origin of many of these problems lies in the decision to take the project on and in the initial scoping.  It would be useful to know if that unit of the Department has a function in identifying how those failures can be prevented in the first instance.  I keep on saying that we have made a national pastime of creating problems and then trying to resolve them in reverse.

One recommendation is that training should be mandatory.  While training is currently provided, it is not mandatory.  Some of the people working on projects do not bother to undergo training on the public spending code.  That is insufficient.<\/p> <p>  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform should insist that every project review, evaluation or value-for-money report carried out in a Department must include a section on the whole-of Government lessons from what went wrong in the unit in question.  Such reports must be considered inadequate without this section.  The public service is designed to confine a mistake it to the one unit in which it takes place.  We have seen this in the HSE.  When something goes wrong in a hospital, there is not even a mechanism in place to share the lessons learned with other hospitals.  We are seeing here that when something goes wrong in the cultural division, the issue is confined to that unit of that Department.  That is guaranteed to ensure that there is no whole-of-Government learning.  We will ask the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to ensure that spending codes include a requirement for every report to have a section outlining the overall lessons for the public service.

The Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht did carry out reviews, which were very welcome.  Those reviews highlighted problems.  Those involved did try to do this.  There is a bigger issue here.  This took place in a political atmosphere in which the project had to go ahead.  We need to look at that element, as in the case of the national children's hospital.<\/p> <p>  Perhaps the Comptroller and Auditor General could comment on project reviews.  I do not know what should go into a project review, but this seems to consist of F&aacute;ilte Ireland telling us how good Galway is.  The report notes that the city council \"owns four properties immediately adjacent to P&aacute;l&aacute;s and intends to develop these\".

I came in literally two minutes after the Chairman finished with this item.  I was caught in traffic.<\/p> <p>  This has been going on for a long time.  I have been asking questions about this since before last summer.  To provide a little bit of context, this information was previously given out in response to parliamentary questions.  When I looked for a subsequent update on the continuing costs, it was denied to me under the general data protection regulation, GDPR.<\/p><p>I also asked questions regarding the two-payments system when it comes to public servants, that is, one can only get one payment if, for instance, one works for a university, is a member of a board or anything like that.  I understand that a number of people who are being paid under this actually do work in other public sector roles as well.  I was absolutely shocked that this information was denied to me.  I was further shocked that the Attorney General's advice was that this information cannot be given.  I had help from the Ceann Comhairle in this regard, as he felt that questions should be answered.  However, when it came to the advice from the Attorney General, that is where it stopped because, as we all know, such advice can never be published.  <\/p><p> I brought this matter to the attention of the Committee of Public Accounts because I felt that it was necessary to use this forum to get some leverage as regards how we are going to get this information.  Frankly, the volume of money that is being paid is a scandal but nobody knows where the money is being spent, who it has been given to, for what and in what detail.  Furthermore, this matter creates a worrying precedent in cases where people are being paid, if they are constituted as individuals.

This is not the reason GDPR exists.<\/p><p>I must thank three journalists, namely, Danny McConnell, political editor, Fiachra &Oacute; Cionnaith and Elaine Loughlin, who work for the <i>Irish Examiner<\/i>, for pursuing this matter.  Subsequently, they got the Data Protection Commissioner effectively to state she does not understand why the advice has been issued or in what context and that it is not justifiable.

In addition, from a Data Protection Commission point of view, it looks like this situation is not appropriate.  I am in the hands of the committee but we really need to pursue this matter because frankly, such a situation cannot go on.  It is against the public interest, it is against what GDPR is being used for and we will not know what people are being paid in this case.  Furthermore, I suspect the Department uses the non-two-payments rule for public servants to the letter of the law in many cases but yet, when it comes to situations in which people working in public bodies constitute themselves as individuals for other payments, the two-payments system does not apply to them and we will not be able to tease that out.  It is a four legs good, two legs bad scenario and that cannot be allow to happen.

It was not intended for that.  To be straight about it, I see what is happening in respect of the non-disclosure of fees paid to barristers, on the advice of the Attorney General, as the legal profession in the employ of the State and the barristers who are working on behalf of the State working together to protect one another.  It is as simple as that.  In the letter from Mr. Derek Moran, he referred to it being necessary and proportionate.  Regarding the test of what is proportionate, if someone is saying that a person getting &euro;1 million from the State &ndash; some barristers at tribunals got &euro;2 million or &euro;3 million over time &ndash; is not proportionate in the public interest and that it would be disproportionate to the individual who received a cheque of &euro;3 million to have his or her name published, that is an abuse.  I know what is happening.  The legal profession is happy to spend the next five years in the Supreme Court and wherever else it goes to ensure that this does not come out.  It just wants to run down the clock, during which time it will continue seeking not to publish the figures.<\/p> <p>  In the first instance, we will get a response from the DPC.  Arising from that, the Committee of Public Accounts, of all the committees in the Oireachtas, has an absolute duty to verify to whom taxpayers&rsquo; money is being paid and for what purpose.  Our committee will have a role.  If we are ultimately satisfied that the legislation is not sufficiently drafted to ensure public accountability for public funds, that issue will have to be revisited.  We will have a little bit of a road to travel first, but the intention of GDPR is not to protect barristers.  It is an abuse of the system by the legal profession, full stop.

Costs arose in parallel with it, which the architect for the Department subsequently said were justified.<\/p> <p>  I forget which witnesses who came before us were asked whether the cost would stay below &euro;2 billion.

We are all aware of cases where families have fallen out, a son or daughter might not be in good communication with the parents and an application for a SUSI grant is held up.  We have asked what SUSI does about these hardship cases and this letter makes for difficult reading.  It states the applicant can provide information to confirm parental divorce or separation by providing the separation or divorce agreement, a court order or a barring order.  We are talking about GDPR and SUSI is requesting college students to provide details of a barring order issued in the family court, which is a private matter, to a Government body to achieve a grant.  Talk about abuse not just of GDPR but the family court procedures.  For SUSI as a State body to ask for detailed information about third parties, as the student is the applicant, with regard to a barring order between two other individuals is outrageous in the extreme.  We are asking it to reconsider this.<\/p> <p>  SUSI states the student can provide details of the dissolution of a civil partnership, whether a parent is in receipt of a deserted wife's allowance or a one-parent family payment.  Sometimes people go their way without a legal agreement for separation or divorce.  In this case, a student can get a letter from a solicitor confirming that legal proceedings are pending or from the family mediation service, and separate utility bills to show they are living apart.  No wonder people experience difficulty when they are being asked for proof of barring orders.  It does not address the reality of students in houses where there is no communication between all of the original family members.  It makes it worse to speak about getting copies of family law court barring orders as evidence.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019110700002#G00800","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1573117200,"counter":106,"content":"<p>I had this marked and the Chairman has addressed it.<\/p><p>The proceedings are held <i>in camera<\/i>for a reason.

We may be here in the new year to deal with that.<\/p> <p>  No. 2487 B is from Mr. Ray Mitchell of the Health Service Executive, providing information requested by the committee.  There is quite a bit here.  The HSE witnesses will be here in a couple of weeks so we will be able to interrogate them further on these matters, but we will note and publish the correspondence for today.  An information note has been provided on risk analysis in respect of decision-making for public private partnerships, PPPs, for health centres.  Regarding the chapter in the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General for this year, the witnesses will be coming in to deal with this in a couple of weeks.  I will confirm what else is in the letter, sighing in the process.  There is a reference to cash advances to section 38 organisations.  Deputy Kelly mentioned this matter.  On the top of page 3, there is a reference to the total payments to the section 38 and 39 organisations in 2018, amounting to &euro;3.258 million for section 38 organisations and &euro;1.025 million for section 39 organisations.  We asked for details on cash advances.  The letter is internally self-contradictory because it states all cash balances are to be neutral at the end of the year and then it states there was &euro;73.6 million outstanding at the end of 2018.  The essence of what is being said is that one gets an advance during the year that is to be paid back by the end of the year.  They give us the year-end outstanding balance saying it will come off next year.  Therefore, it is not neutral in the year, although that is the impression the HSE has been giving us up to now.  We will tease this out further.<\/p> <p>  There is further information on the cross-border initiative and its cost.  There is a note on the arrangements for holiday cover in respect of home help.  I will raise this myself again.  It is a new departure to cancel cover for people.  Cover is provided when home helps go on holidays on a priority basis.  That was not the case in the past.

The responses are unreal.  With regard to Nos. 1 and 2, pertaining to planning and design, the first line states the planning risk transfer was reduced as the HSE had received planning permission.  There was limited risk as opposed to significant risk.  With regard to No. 2, design, the State had already done the design so, again, there was limited risk, not significant risk.  No. 4 concerns operational risks or events that could lead to the facility being unavailable, including failure to have the rooms in the facility heated to the correct temperature, leaks, vandalism, or failure to have the facility adequately cleaned.  None of these is deemed a significant risk.  Is the HSE saying a project is classified as a PPP project because of the risk that a radiator might not be working or that a tap might be dripping?  Even in regard to the building being cleaned, do all public buildings not have cleaners to clean them?  It is pure nonsense.  On legislation, the correspondents more or less state in response to No. 7 that they should obey the law.  It is totally unsatisfactory and pretty much a nonsense that this is their justification for PPP classification.

Second, with regard to the section 38 and section 39 organisations, which I have been raising for over a year, this is complete and utter garbage.  It is actually riddling the books.  A number of these organisations are on the edge and cannot sustain themselves.  Basically, what happens is the HSE gives them so-called loans or cash advances to function.  This used to happen after the summer but it is now happening in the first or second quarter of the year.  Are they insulting our intelligence?  They are trying to insult our intelligence by saying that this will be cash neutral.  It is not going to be cash neutral.  These organisations have huge deficits.  They are basically doing the work of the State but they have been starved of resources.  In many cases, their services are weakening and in some cases, they are going to close down.  There is an avalanche of these issues coming.  In advance of our meeting and in order to help this committee in its deliberations and questioning, I want those figures broken down further.  I would also like a breakdown of how much has been given in cash advances over the past two years, in tabular form, to each organisation and when the advances were given.  In another column, I would like to see the total spend per year for each organisation in 2017, 2018 and the following year.  This is just rolling on and getting worse every year.

We have talked about this particular issue previously and I agree with what has been said.  These organisations are losing clinical staff because they cannot pay the same rates as the HSE.  In many cases, the services being provided should be public services but often the charities are more flexible and are being paid less by the State for comparable work.  There is a real issue there.  I ask that before the representatives come in, they provide us with some context for the table on page 7 on home support services in the various CHOs.  Expenditure in the year to date is one thing but we need to know what the waiting lists are like.  Just giving us those figures is not enough.  It looks like one area is doing better than another but the size of the catchment area for the CHOs provides a context, as does the length of the waiting lists.  There may be a much longer waiting time in an area that seems to be under-provided for than in an area that appears to have a lot of money.  I do not think the table on its own is sufficient.

We need that figure, broken down by CHO region too.<\/p> <p>  The next item of correspondence, No. 2502, is from Mr. Ronan Murphy, the chief executive of Horse Sport Ireland, HSI, dated 23 October, providing a detailed response to a request for a timeline for the implementation of the recommendations of the Indecon report, Review of Certain Matters relating to Horse Sport Ireland.  HSI states that the recommendations were implemented between August 2017 and 2018.  We will note and publish this.  There is a lot of data there so I suggest that we note it for now and if any member wants to take it up in further detail, he or she is free to do so.  <\/p> <p>  The next items of correspondence, Nos. 2503 and 2526, are letters from Mr. Jim Meade, the chief executive of Irish Rail, dated 23 October and 6 November, respectively.  The correspondence relates to the public services card and in particular, to a case that was referred to at our meeting on 26 September.  Included in the correspondence is some detail on how suspected fraud is dealt with by the organisation.  The letter is claiming that what was said at the Committee of Public Accounts meeting was untrue and inaccurate.  Based on the information given at this meeting, everybody here acted in a totally reasonable manner and assumed certain things.  There is criticism of me in the letter but I was giving Irish Rail the benefit of the doubt that when it issued a bill, notice or charge to somebody it did so on the basis of knowing how many trips were taken.  I was giving the organisation the benefit of the doubt rather than suggesting that it was issuing bills willy nilly, without knowing how many trips were taken.  In the letter received, Irish Rail says it is untrue to say that it had details of the trips taken by an individual, which is surprising.  The follow up correspondence, No. 2526, states that Irish Rail issues a fixed penalty notice in circumstances where a free travel pass is cancelled but a person continues to use it.  This has highlighted the fact that there is no proper exchange of information between the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection and the CIE Group in order to make sure that free travel cards do not continue to be used when they are no longer valid.  It takes months for this information to be provided to Irish Rail and Mr. Meade refers to the fact that people can be using withdrawn cards for years.  There is something very seriously wrong in the co-ordination between the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection and the CIE Group on this matter.  Understandably, this has been a learning process for everybody.  The letter explains that a fixed penalty notice is based on the period in which the card was being used.  If it is, for example, four months since the card was cancelled, Irish Rail sends out a notice for four months although the individual may not have ever used the card.  Irish Rail says that there is a separate situation whereby a passenger who fails to deliver up a valid ticket on a specific day when requested to do so by an authorised officer will be issued with a fixed penalty notice.  This is separate from a debt, which is a civil matter.  The correspondence to which I originally referred related to an actual debt.  On the debt issued, we do not have the exact details of how that was calculated and Irish Rail has not offered those details.  We asked for details on the fixed penalty notices that were issued in 2016, 2017 and 2018, the amounts paid and the payments outstanding.  In summary, the situation for last year was that 12,000 notices were issued and 6,000 were paid.  The value of the fixed penalty notices issued was &euro;1.7 million and the amount paid was &euro;0.7 million.  Less than half of the fixed penalty notices are paid but more to the point, we want details on the bills that Irish Rail issues, that is, what it calls debts.  It issues bills for what it terms \"a debt due\" and we want the same type of information on those bills, namely the number issued for each of the three aforementioned years, as well as the amounts paid and the amounts outstanding.  It will be helpful to us when we get that information.  We will also ask the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection later today about the exchange of information.  We were told at a previous meeting that the travel companies know the details of all the trips taken using the card but do not know the name of the person.  The number on the card is anonymised but the Department can relate the number back to the public services card and it knows how often it was used.  The CIE Group of companies and Irish Rail are saying that they do not have details of the person's individual travel.<\/p><p>The outcome of all of this is troubling.  Whether it is a fixed payment notice or a debt, Irish Rail is issuing bills to people that are not connected with the number of trips those people should not have taken and for which they did not pay.  Those bills were issued on a time basis or some other method.  We will come back to this issue.  We will get some information from the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection and then we will conclude our work on this matter as soon as we have that further clarification.  I will continue to pursue this because I raised this issue and I was referred to in that letter.  We will get further clarification.  We will note and publish the information.<\/p><p> No. 2504 B is from Mr. John O'Sullivan, chief executive and Commissioner of Valuation, Valuation Office, dated 23 October 2019, providing the further information we requested regarding appeals, adjustments to valuations in 2017 and 2019 and the rateability of car parks in supermarkets and shopping centres.  These issues have been mentioned and there is interesting reading in this document.

That is interesting for people involved in that trade and we will follow up on that outstanding item of information.<\/p> <p>  No. 2505 B is from Mr. Dave Walsh, chairperson, An Bord Plean&aacute;la, dated 25 October 2019.  It provides information requested by the committee at our meeting on 3 October 2019, including a breakdown of the 2,800 decisions made by the board, encompassing the number of decisions made by the full board and those made by a partial board.  Mr. Walsh states that 88% of all meetings comprised the full board.  That is my understanding of the answer given to our first question.  The second question concerned categories of decisions where the chairman felt that it was an appropriate matter to bring to the full board.  Mr. Walsh refers to that as category one.<\/p> <p>  It is also noted that we asked two questions that are more appropriate to the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, namely, the number of times in which the Minister has invoked section 181 powers to grant permission and the issue of gender balance on the board.  Those are matters on which the Department will have to reply to us.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Walsh gives further information on the current status of the 101 recommendations of the 2016 report.  That information is here.  Our fifth query concerned a breakdown of the categories of respondents to the consultation regarding An Bord Plean&aacute;la's website.  That response can be read and includes details on the type of people who access the website.<\/p> <p>  A note on gender balance is also included and the Minister will be asked to answer that query.  Copies of the resum&eacute;s of all of the board members are attached, as is a breakdown of the number of decisions of the board accepting an inspector's recommendation.  People will be interested in this topic.  Mr. Walsh has stated that in 89% of cases the report of the inspector is accepted but not in the other 11%.  An acceptance rate of about 90% is fairly high and it would be inevitable that the board would be entitled to make its own decision on some cases.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Walsh's letter next addresses the issue of strategic infrastructure decisions.  Some 84% of all such applications are granted, with 16% refused.  That is interesting because there is a presumption abroad that under the strategic infrastructure process, if there is a meeting with the board, the details of an application are gone through and that application is then submitted on the basis that confirmation would almost be certain.  That is not quite the case, as some 16% of applications are refused at the end of the process.<\/p> <p>  Our next query dealt with the number of cases that have been with An Bord Plean&aacute;la for more than a year.  There are 74 of those and details are given in the correspondence.  Some of those instances are referral cases and some involve complex legalities.  All of the information is given in the correspondence.<\/p> <p>  We also inquired about the number of oral hearings upheld by the board.  Mr. Walsh informs us that oral hearings were held in nine planning cases in 2018 and the planning authority upheld decisions in eight cases.<\/p> <p>  Our 12th question regarded cases where the decision of An Bord Plean&aacute;la contravened a county development plan.  The correspondence states that An Bord Plean&aacute;la does not gather such information.  It makes its decision and is aware of the county development plan, but An Bord Plean&aacute;la does not gather statistics on cases where such decisions are made.  We know An Bord Plean&aacute;la takes such information into account, but it is not legally bound to follow the county development plan.  That is because things are often put into a development plan for good local reasons that would not stand up to the scrutiny of An Bord Plean&aacute;la.<\/p> <p>  That is good information, it is good to get it and I thank An Bord Plean&aacute;la for supplying all of the information requested.  We will note and publish that information.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019110700002#K01300","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1573117200,"counter":165,"content":"<p>That final question is important.  The county development plan interrogates a wider scenario than an individual development.  It is a wider framework and not just about the development of an individual site.  It takes into account whether there are water and public transport services and similar aspects.  I refer to a breach of the county development plan.  New wording has gone into county development plans on foot of court cases where it has been directed that there should be compliance with it, as opposed to having regard to it, but An Bord Plean&aacute;la has a different standard.  That is really significant in respect of problems that will arise in the future.  It is not for this committee to deal with, but I will not be in silent consensus with the idea that information is not gathered.  That is a really worrying issue.  There will be a cost if the services available are not measured and then they have to be retrofitted.

It is important for the local and regional authorities and the Department to know this information.  It would appear that somebody should be collecting this information, so we will pass this information on to the other sectoral committee when we get it.  The reason I am commenting is that I have seen county development plans that have stated there should be no mobile phone masts within 200 m of a house.

Two and a half pages of a letter have been provided giving details of inspections.  For those who have an interest in this matter, the best thing we can do is note it today and publish it.  They may come back to us but we are not experts on the inspections of vehicles, whether they are registered in Ireland or outside the State.  A legitimate point was raised with us regarding the regime of inspections.  There is a reply there, which we will note and send to the organisation that contacted us on the matter and perhaps we will have further communication from it at a later stage.  That is agreed.<\/p> <p>  No. 2507 is from John McKeon, Secretary General of the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, relating to our request for the business case for the public services card.  He makes it very clear in his letter there is no single business case document relating to the development of the SAFE identity authentication process for the card.  He sets out that the Comptroller and Auditor General covered this in his report three years ago, and it is analysed time by time.  The Secretary General will be before us later when we will discuss the public services card.  We will note and publish that correspondence and discuss it later.  <\/p> <p>  No. 2508 is from Steven Sheridan of the Housing Agency responding to a request for a list of approved housing bodies, AHBs, registered with the interim regulator.  He clarifies the regulator's office operates on a voluntary code and AHBs are signed up to it rather than registered.  There are 275 bodies signed up to the code.  The Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government is responsible for maintaining the register of all AHBs, of which there are now 551, but we know that 95% of the assets are in the bodies signed up to the code.  The information is set out in a link to the website.<\/p> <p>  No. 2512 is from John McKeon, Secretary General, of the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, who will be here shortly, regarding grants paid to travel operators in respect of free travel.  That arose from discussion on the matter.  We will discuss the public services card and free travel with him.  We will note and publish that correspondence and it can be discussed later.<\/p> <p>  Some category C correspondence has been held over for a little while.  No. 2464 is from an individual, dated 14 October, on behalf of a group based in Donegal called the Great Arch action committee, which is requesting the committee to investigate a planning decision by Donegal County Council regarding a proposed pathway to a viewing point for the Pollet Great Arch, Fanad.  Local authorities are not within the remit of the committee.  We must write back stating that it is not within our remit to examine that matter and directing the group accordingly.  It has obviously talked to the local authority, the ombudsman or whoever it believes is the appropriate body but it is not this committee.<\/p> <p>  No. 2479 is from persons calling themselves B and C, dated 17 October.  Members will recall the individuals had previously corresponded with the committee regarding the University of Limerick, UL.  The committee was copied with correspondence that was sent to the Minister for Education and Skills.  We have had other correspondence relating to UL in recent weeks.  While there has been an effort to conduct a mediation in the college it seems it has not reached a successful conclusion.  I propose we add these matters relating to third level colleges, including UL, to our work programme.  The UL issue seems to be ongoing.  We will not get to complete that issue between now and Christmas but we can have it on our work programme for the new year.<\/p> <p>  No. 2488 is from Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith, relating to an inquiry into Our Lady's Hospice, Harold's Cross.  At our meeting on 19 September, we noted an update from the HSE that the case is currently with the Director of Public Prosecutions, DPP, who is addressing some further queries with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and there was no further information at that time.  The HSE is scheduled for a meeting with us on 5 December and we will request an update on this for that meeting.  Members will note the matter is with the Garda and the DPP.  This committee will not have a role in it but we will get an update on it from the HSE as our meeting with it in a few weeks time.<\/p> <p>  No. 2490 is from an individual, dated 20 October, who raises some points about the Government's spending policies.  The individual raises issues that have been before this committee on several occasions previously.  He refers to the cost of providing broadband and the cost of the children's hospital.  We will note it and circulate it to members of the committee.  It is not for publication but members can take it into consideration.  We will not be specifically following it up but it relates to spending of Government money on matters already covered by the committee.<\/p> <p>  No. 2491 is from Deputy Cullinane, dated 21 October, regarding media allegations that RT&Eacute; is facilitating tax avoidance.

It is timely it has come up today given the announcement by the director general of RT&Eacute; that there will a 15% pay cut for these top presenters, which most people will welcome.

The Committee of Public Accounts is on the case.  We have mentioned it.  The Joint Committee on Transport, Tourism and Sport is looking at the matter from a Bus &Eacute;ireann point of view and the Joint Committee on Education and Skills is also examining it.  We are not going to do any more.  I do not believe in three committees of this House dealing with one item of correspondence so this committee will take no further action.  If we get a response to the last letter, well and good, but it is not fair on the Oireachtas to have three different committees working on the same topic.  I understand what is involved.  The matter affects the Committee of Public Accounts, Bus &Eacute;ireann and the school bus service but there needs to be a system here to ensure that members of three different committees are not reading the same correspondence at three different meetings in the one week.  We will wait for a response.<\/p> <p>  We are nearly there.  We said that we would have the witnesses come in about now.  The next item is the financial statements and accounts since the previous meeting.  A few have been received.  The first relate to F&aacute;ilte Ireland, the National Tourism Development Authority .  Its turnover for the year was &euro;140 million.  It received a qualified audited opinion on the basis of its deferred pension asset.  F&aacute;ilte Ireland's accounts do not recognise pension asset funding in respect of its pension scheme.  We have seen that previously.  It is a standard one.<\/p> <p>  Next is the Mental Health Commission.  Again, this is a qualified audit opinion.  The cost of the superannuation entitlements are not properly recognised versus international accounting standards as the standard of qualification in the health service.<\/p> <p>  The next one is Galway and Roscommon Education and Training Board, ETB.  It is a clear audit opinion.  Attention is drawn to non-compliant procurement of &euro;698,000 and the board's concern is regarding the adequacy of the internal audit resources.  They have all mentioned that latter point.  We are writing to them for a detailed report on the non-compliance with public procurement and to request them to give us the details of the contracts and the measures that are in place and as to why that happened.  In the new year, we hope to compile all the sets of accounts that have come to us in order to deal with that topic.  For now, it is a compilation of information.

There is a clear audit opinion in this regard.<\/p> <p>  Next is the National Concert Hall, for which there is also a clear audited opinion.<\/p> <p>  Next is Bord na gCon.  It is a clear audited opinion but attention is drawn to impairment losses totalling &euro;20.6 million recognised in the financial statements of five subsidiary companies following the board's review of impairment for 2018.  We had representatives from Bord na gCon before the committee recently.  We went through these impairments and the company's revaluations of its assets, but we are formally noting that.  The accounts have since been laid before the Oireachtas.  That is why we are noting it but we did discuss it at length.  That is the end of that particular topic.<\/p> <p>  The next item is the work programme, in respect of which we will have a very brief discussion.  Before us today are officials from the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  Next week, on 12 November, we will have a private meeting from 4 p.m.  Tomorrow morning, the secretariat will issue a working paper to members of the committee in respect of the work it has carried out in assisting us with our consideration and drafting of a periodic report.  No report has been drafted and one will not be issued.  This is a working paper from the secretariat.  It has had no input from any member of the committee.  It is not a Committee of Public Accounts document.  We will consider that working paper at our meeting on Tuesday next, 12 November.  I plead with members to try to read the document, which contains many pages, because it would be great if we could get through our first reading in the one meeting.  Otherwise, we will have to keep coming back to it and we want to get this report out as soon as is practicable.  If members have anything in particular to say, they should make a note rather than starting to read this document when we arrive for the meeting.<\/p> <p>  I will come back to the work programme but Deputy Cullinane has indicated.  We had suggested a meeting on the following Tuesday, 19 November, to deal with the Department of Communication, Climate Action and Environment in respect of greenhouse gases and carbon taxation.  I propose that we do not proceed with the meeting on that date and that we will re-schedule it for a Thursday afternoon.  Three Tuesdays in a row is a bit too heavy for us.  We do much work on a Thursday so we will try not to have that third Tuesday meeting.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019110700002#M01600","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1573117200,"counter":206,"content":"<p>Can I raise an issue about the work programme and how we allocate the lead and second speakers?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019110700002#M01700","speaker":"1258"},{"type":"speech","time":1573117200,"counter":207,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019110700002#M01800","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1573117200,"counter":208,"content":"<p>This is the place and the time to do it.

We will have a separate session with representatives of the Health Service Executive to deal with the development of primary care services.

Therefore, it will be a second round and the HSE is asking what specifically we want to discuss on that occasion.  It would be helpful if we did not just go back over what we did before the summer.  We have mentioned a few items, for example, measures to reduce the incidence of cases involving clinical negligence that may lead to State claims, matters related to CervicalCheck, the oversight of section 38 and section 39 bodies and home help services, including the changes made during the year.  I also want to receive an update on private ambulance contracts which have been in place for years and not renewed.  I have asked parliamentary questions about this issue.

Expenditure on the schemes is accounted for in two accounts: the appropriation account for Vote 37, and the account of the Social Insurance Fund.  The Department&rsquo;s overall expenditure on scheme payments in 2018 totalled &euro;19.6 billion.  An appendix to the appropriation account provides a useful summary of the combined scheme expenditure, set out on a scheme-by-scheme basis within broad programme groups.  The Department&rsquo;s expenditure on administration of the schemes amounted to a further &euro;636 million.<br\/><br\/>The Vote account is funded mainly through direct Exchequer issues.  In contrast, the Social Insurance Fund is financed mainly from pay related social insurance contributions, which are collected by the Revenue Commissioners, acting as the Department&rsquo;s collection agent.  Total receipts into the fund in 2018 were &euro;11.2 billion, an increase of 9.4% on the previous year and an increase of almost 47% on the 2013 level.  The fund receipts included &euro;575 million in levies payable to the national training fund operated by the Department of Education and Skills.  The surplus on the Social Insurance Fund for 2018 was in excess of &euro;1.1 billion.  This left the fund with accumulated reserves of &euro;2.3 billion at the year end.  I gave a clear audit opinion on the accounts of both the Vote and the Social Insurance Fund for 2018.<br\/><br\/>Before I turn to the three chapters of my 2018 report, I wish to draw the committee&rsquo;s attention to a typographical error we identified in the Vote account as published.  In note 6.1, which deals with the Department&rsquo;s expenditure on compensation cases, the column titled &quot;compensation awarded&quot; should have been titled &quot;legal costs awarded&quot; and<i>vice versa<\/i>.  The figures in the note are not affected.  I wish to correct the record on that matter.<br\/><br\/>On chapter 12, regularity of social welfare payments, for a variety of reasons, some welfare recipients may be paid amounts to which they are not entitled or that exceed their entitlements.  Such irregular payments can arise as a result of inadvertent claimant errors, deliberate fraud by claimants or departmental administration errors.  Control surveys of welfare schemes carried out by the Department are intended to identify the types of cases where such excess payments arise.  The surveys also provide a basis for estimating the level of irregular payments and underpayments affecting the schemes examined.  The results of successive control surveys suggest that there is a material level of irregular payments on both Vote and social insurance schemes in 2018.  As has been the case for several years, I have drawn attention to this in both audit certificates.<br\/><br\/>Chapter 12 also outlines the findings of a 2018 control survey of a random sample of 1,000 recipients of the non-contributory State pension.  The Department found that one in five of the recipients whose claims were reviewed in the survey were receiving payments in excess of their entitlements.  The overpayments averaged approximately &euro;50 per week for those who were overpaid.  The excess payments represented 6.5% of the overall value of the payments reviewed.  Significantly, the control survey also found that more than 8% of recipients were receiving less than they were entitled, by an average of approximately &euro;30 per week.  The underpayments represented 1.1% of the overall payments reviewed.  From a regularity perspective, these errors do not offset one another.  Paying one claimant less than their entitlement does not compensate for paying someone else more than their entitlement.  The Department has initiated changes to the control framework for the scheme to address the causes of the errors.<br\/><br\/>Chapter 13 reviews the timeliness of claim processing by the Department, which is a key performance measure.  Claim processing indicators have been included in the annual Vote Estimates for several years.  The Department has set targets for each scheme in terms of the volume of claims to be awarded within a defined time period.  In most cases, the Department achieves in or around the target levels.  It has reported significant progress in recent years in reducing the average time to award claims. The diagram in the written submission I have provided shows the average number of weeks taken to award a claim in 2018 for the main scheme types.  Typically, schemes with the longest waiting time for a decision are those where eligibility conditions require a medical assessment, a means assessment, or both.<\/p><p>The examination noted that, for some welfare schemes, the rate of claim rejection exceeds 20%, which may indicate a need to provide better information to claimants about scheme qualification criteria.<\/p><p> Chapter 14 examines the development of application forms from the perspective of customer service.  Minimising the difficulty of the application process is key to the delivery of good customer service to applicants for income support and to ensure the correct outcome for each application in a timely way.<\/p><p> The Department relies on an extensive suite of paper forms for information gathering.  Based on our examination of a sample of the Department&rsquo;s forms, these are typically lengthy, which may be intimidating or difficult for some applicants.  However, the forms examined generally conform well with good design guidance issued by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. <\/p><p> In terms of processing, the Department makes extensive use of scanning technology to read certain paper forms but this continues to require extensive manual intervention and checking.<\/p><p> There are a limited number of schemes with an online application facility.  Where this option is available, online usage rates are generally very low.  There appears to be significant scope for further development and roll-out of online claim application options.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019110700002#Q00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1573117200,"counter":247,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for inviting me here today to discuss the appropriation account for Vote 37, chapters 12, 13, and 14 of the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and the account of the Social Insurance Fund, SIF, all for the year ending 2018.<\/p> <p>  The Chair has already introduced the other members of my team and I ask for permission to rely on them for assistance in answering questions from the committee during the course of the meeting.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019110700002#R00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. John McKeon"},{"type":"speech","time":1573117200,"counter":248,"content":"<p>Absolutely.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019110700002#R00250","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1573117200,"counter":249,"content":"<p>I arranged for an advance copy of this statement, together with briefing material on each of the chapters on the review, the annual report of the Department, the annual statistics report and other relevant information to be provided to the committee secretariat last week.  I hope that members found this material to be of use.<\/p> <p>  In previous opening statements at this committee, I spoke about the role of social welfare in compensating for and mitigating the impact of failures in the market economy and about how our staff are acutely aware, through their everyday work, of the impact of welfare and employment services on the lives of  individuals and families.  In saying this, it is important to emphasise that the term \"social welfare\" or \"social protection\", insofar as it is colloquially and properly used to describe the work of the Department covers a far broader remit than is traditionally associated with the term.  For some people the term \"social welfare\" creates images of dole office queues and connotations of handouts.  This was never a fair reflection of the role of the Department, the nature of its work or the disposition of the people it serves and it is certainly not the case now.<\/p> <p>  The Department is, as members will be aware, responsible for the provision of policy advice and the delivery of services across a broad and expanding remit.  As well as the traditional range of cradle-to-grave welfare services, which are themselves expanding, the remit now covers employment affairs and employment services, as well as general registry services, citizens information and advice and pensions supervision and regulation.<\/p> <p>  The Department is heavily involved in both the evaluation and development of policy and the design, development and delivery of services, giving it a breadth and depth of responsibility that is unique in an Irish Civil Service context.  The expenditure of the Department equates to approximately 37% of Government current expenditure and the Department employs approximately 20% of all staff in the Civil Service.  More notably, the impact of the Department&rsquo;s work is felt by every person, family and business in the State.  If a single statistic can encapsulate its impact, it is that the schemes and services delivered by the Department reduce the risk of poverty by some 50% compared to that which would otherwise pertain.<\/p> <p>  In delivering on this brief, the staff of the Department strive to always deliver an effective and efficient service and, in doing this, they are very mindful of the vulnerability of the people who rely on our services.  However, it is inevitable, given our breadth and scale, that failures will occur and it is equally inevitable that when these failures do occur, the committee and I, as Secretary General, will hear about them much more frequently and much more vociferously than we hear about the normal, routine, high level of service in, for example, processing over 2 million claims and making over 80 million payments across 86 different schemes and services every year.<\/p> <p>  I hope I will be forgiven, therefore, if I take this opportunity to acknowledge the work of our staff by drawing attention to the evidence that they consistently deliver a high level of service.  Evidence in the customer satisfaction research shows an 85% satisfaction level, in the low level of appeals of less than 1%, in the accreditation for service quality excellence by the International Social Security Association, and in the award of Quality and Qualifications Ireland, QQI, certification up to level 8 of the national framework of qualifications or staff development and training programmes to name just some of the external recognition received during the year.  This is not to diminish the cases where we have failed or could do better and we also have to recognise and learn from these cases.  That is why the work of the Comptroller and Auditor General not only in reviewing our accounts but in examining, every year, specific aspects of our operations is welcomed, as is the scrutiny of this committee in holding us to account in respect of the findings of the Comptroller and Auditor General. <\/p> <p>  Turning now to the Comptroller and Auditor General report for 2018, I do not, in the interests of time, intend to comment on all of the accounts and chapters but I do wish to make some remarks in respect of issues that I believe may be of interest to the committee or which have already been signalled as being of interest.  These relate to the status of the Social Insurance Fund, Brexit, service performance statistics and the public services card.<\/p> <p>  The Committee will note from the 2018 accounts that the Social Insurance Fund appears to be in robust financial health.  Expenditure during the year of &euro;10 billion was some &euro;1.1 billion less than receipts, yielding an accumulated surplus at the year-end of &euro;2.3 billion.  I can confirm that this trend has continued and we anticipate that this surplus will be in the order of &euro;4 billion, or thereabouts, by year-end 2019.  It is important to note that this positive trend will not continue and should not be allowed to engender complacency with regard to the challenges that lie ahead.  Past experience indicates that cyclical forces can wipe out this surplus very quickly.  In 2008, a surplus of &euro;3.4 billion was wiped out in 15 months and, over the next six years, the SIF was dependent on Exchequer transfers totalling &euro;7.4 billion in order to meet its obligations to contributors.  That was in the context of favourable demographic conditions.<\/p> <p>  Looking to the future, demographic trends will significantly increase expenditure of the SIF as the number of older people in our society increases.  This is clear from our 2020 Estimates, which show an existing level of service increase in expenditure of about &euro;520 million, of which over &euro;330 million is due to pension pressures.  This trend will continue with the result that it is inevitable that even with positive economic conditions, the fund will enter into and remain in deficit.  The most recent actuarial review forecasts an annual spend of about &euro;15 billion and an annual deficit of about &euro;3 billion per annum by 2030.  This sets a challenging context for the development of medium to long-tem policy, a context in which the social contract may come under pressure and in which the continuing, if not stronger, support and solidarity of contributors will be essential to the maintenance of the existing level and range of services. <\/p> <p>  I will now turn to Brexit and its impact on the Department and the people it serves.  The Department has two main concerns in relation to Brexit: first to protect access to benefits and entitlements for people and, second, to ensure that we can respond quickly and appropriately to any job losses attendant on an economic shock.<\/p> <p>  Existing EU-sponsored arrangements provide for access to and portability of benefits in order to protect the interests of its citizens moving between member states.  Against this background, many people were concerned that once the UK exited the EU, these arrangements would cease to exist.  The Department has for a long time had a very strong co-operative relationship both with the Department of Work and Pensions in the UK and the Department for Communities in Northern Ireland.  I can confirm therefore that, building on these relationships and within the framework of the common travel area, the Department agreed and signed an international convention with the UK, which fully protects the interests of citizens from both jurisdictions regardless of the nature of any Brexit.  People will have access to the same benefits on the same terms under this agreement as they do at present, including free travel on the island of Ireland.<\/p> <p>  The Department conducted its own assessment of the likely employment impacts of any downturn in the labour market by region and sector.  Based on this assessment, we worked and continue to work very closely with our colleagues in the enterprise and education sectors to ensure that our shared processes to respond to job losses and provide employment and training supports are robust and flexible enough to support affected workers.  We are confident, based on this work, that the organisation and processes innovations made following the 2008&ndash;12 crisis will stand us in good stead in delivering an effective and seamless service to people who may be affected by job losses post Brexit.  We are also confident in our ability to quickly process any large influx of claims and avoid any repeat of long queues outside our offices.  The development of our online service capability and the introduction of a front-office, back-office model of working will be particularly beneficial in that regard.<\/p> <p>  Chapter 13 of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report relates to performance monitoring within the Department.  The Comptroller and Auditor General notes that, with some exceptions, service performance on most schemes is within target levels and is improving.  Last year, committee members expressed particular concern regarding the time to decide carer's allowance claims.  The Department acknowledged these issues and advised that it was taking measures to remedy the situation.  Although the data in the Comptroller and Auditor General report offer no comfort in this regard, I can advise that the Department has, during 2019, undertaken a review and redesign of the carer&rsquo;s claims process and has allocated additional staff to this function.<\/p><p>We have also increased the complement of medical assessors.  Although there is much work still to be done, these steps are now yielding results.  For example, the average processing time for carers' claims in October was just under ten weeks.  This compares with an average of 17 weeks in 2018 and is the lowest level in ten years.  I understand that ten weeks may still seem a long period to decide a claim, but the complexity of the scheme, which is dependent on multiple conditionalities across two beneficiaries - the carer and the person in receipt of care - is such that these types of claim will always take longer to decide.  Nevertheless, we will continue our efforts to improve the service further.<br\/><br\/>I am aware that the committee members are concerned to understand both the legal status of the standard authentication framework environment-public services card, SAFE-PSC, process and the value for money, or otherwise, of the process.  With regard to the legal status, this is, as members are aware, a matter on which there is a difference of opinion between the Department and the Data Protection Commission, DPC.  In saying this, it is important to note that there is no difference of opinion between us on the core issue of whether the Department has the function and right to require people to authenticate their identity and to produce a public services card, PSC, when accessing its services.  This is a key finding that contradicts and puts to bed the main criticism made of the PSC by some observers.  Other aspects are the subject of disagreement between the Department and the DPC and we are anxious, as is, we understand, the DPC, that these matters be clarified and resolved as soon as possible in accordance with the process set down by the Oireachtas.  We therefore await receipt of an enforcement notice and, subject to what it might say, we may seek the necessary clarity in the Circuit Court.  We hope that this process can be completed expeditiously.<br\/><br\/>With regard to the issue of value for money, the committee is already aware from its review of this matter in 2016 that there is no single business case document.  While, as I indicated in my letter of last week, this is regrettable, it should not be taken as evidence that the project was not planned or executed properly.  In fact, as acknowledged in the Comptroller and Auditor General's report from 2016, 17 of the 19 key elements of a best practice business case were, in fact, in place.<br\/><br\/>Having reviewed the costs and benefits associated with the project, I am satisfied that it has created the basis for improved service delivery, reduced administrative costs and enhanced control savings.  In a letter sent to the committee last week I indicated that the total fully allocated costs of the project to date are &euro;67.7 million.  However, a large proportion of these costs would have been incurred even if the SAFE process had never been introduced.  This is because the Department always sought to authenticate the identity of people claiming its services and issued identity tokens in the form of pension books, social services cards and free travel passes.  The SAFE process formalised this approach, established a consistent approach across all of our offices, and introduced a higher, more secure, standard of identity token in the form of a PSC, incorporating a photograph of the person.  If a conservative allowance is made, as it properly should be, for the counterfactual or already existing costs, then the actual additional costs of the SAFE-PSC process over the past nine years are, at most, approximately &euro;37 million.<br\/><br\/>Set against these costs are the benefits of the improved process.  These include administrative efficiencies within the Department, reduced payment leakage due to error or fraud, the deterrence and prevention of fraud, but most of all, improved customer service as people accessing our services do not now have to verify their identity on each separate occasion on which they make a new claim or service request.  In addition, secure authentication of identity provides the platform on which the Department is now rolling out online service access.  This has already delivered some administrative efficiencies and will deliver even greater levels of savings as well as significantly simplifying service access for people into the future.  As the PSC and <i>myGov.ie<\/i>platforms are available for use by public service providers, the savings and service benefits just instanced for the Department can also be realised by these other providers.<br\/><br\/>Ignoring the deterrence of fraud benefits, which are difficult to estimate, and ignoring the customer service benefits and the benefits that are being realised in other public service organisations, I conservatively estimate that the direct savings attributable to reduced payment leakage and administrative efficiencies within the Department already amount to more than &euro;20 million.  As the take-up of online service access increases, as inevitably it will, and as more people who are now SAFE-registered return to make second and subsequent claims, the level of administrative savings and customer service benefits will increase still further.  I am confident that these direct savings to the Department will, over the next few years, exceed project costs and that the overall project, taking account of the other benefits mentioned but not included in the figures above, will deliver strong value for money.  These figures are estimates only and I acknowledge that we will need a fuller cost-benefit analysis.  Therefore, I intend, early in 2020, when full-year costs for 2019 are finalised, to commission a full cost-benefit analysis of the project.<br\/><br\/>Just under &euro;10 million of the savings realised to date relates to detected fraud.  Individual prosecutions on some cases have amounted to more than &euro;400,000 and I have provided the committee, under separate cover today, with some examples of cases for its information.  In doing this I wish to return to the principle of solidarity mentioned in respect to the maintenance of the social contract.  As one eminent High Court judge has noted, prosecutions such as those circulated help to underpin the solidarity necessary to sustain continued public support for and confidence in the integrity of our social welfare system.  In other words, it is important not just that we stand over the integrity of our control processes but that we are manifestly seen to apply high standards in the detection and prevention of fraud and to deploy, within the parameters available under law, the best technology available to that purpose.<br\/><br\/>The benefit in authenticating identity is, therefore, not confined to administrative efficiencies or from the savings from the detection and, more importantly, the deterrence of welfare fraud but is just as much concerned with the fact that we can defend the system of social expenditure against the claims by some that the system itself is open to widespread and uncontrolled abuse.  These claims, although untrue, would, if not rebutted, threaten the continued support of the public necessary to sustain the funding of the services we provide, funding which, as I mentioned in my opening remarks, will have to increase significantly in future years if the existing range and levels of service is to be maintained.  Similar considerations apply to demonstrably using the best technology available to minimise administrative cost and error to reassure the public that scarce funds are not being consumed by bureaucracy rather than being delivered to the intended beneficiaries.  These are intangible but very important considerations that should not, I believe, be lost in the discussion on the merits or otherwise of initiatives such as SAFE-PSC.<br\/><br\/>I will repeat something I said last year.  We, by which I mean the managers and staff of the Department, work hard to deliver services to the communities from which we come and in which we live, conscious that it is our families, our friends and our neighbours who not only depend on these services but who, through their social insurance contributions and taxes, pay for these services.  We are proud of the work we do but we know we are not perfect and we do not always get things right.  That is why we welcome the oversight of the Comptroller and Auditor General and of this committee.  This process plays an important role in reminding us of our purpose, helping us to identify areas for improvement and helping us to learn from our mistakes.  It is through such a process that we would hope to improve.  I and my colleagues will be pleased to take any questions that members may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019110700002#R00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. John McKeon","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1573117200,"counter":251,"content":"<p>For clarification, Mr. McKeon said he had provided the committee, under separate cover, with some examples of cases where savings were realised due to the detection of fraud.

Huge areas are covered by the Department and Mr. McKeon confirms that its customers are a huge part of our life and are made up of people of all ages, all demographics, rather than just people on the dole.  There are three special chapters in the Comptroller and Auditor General's report that we are discussing, along with the appropriation accounts, this morning.  I will start by focusing on the level of irregular payments made by the Department.<\/p><p>With an overall budget of &euro;11 billion, the moneys involved in this Vote are substantial.  This issue is topical.  In January, the Department published the result of a control survey of the non-contributory State pension scheme.  The scheme is a substantial piece of expenditure that accounted for some &euro;1 billion in 2018.  The Department examined 1,000 payments made during one week in 2017, at which time there were 99,000 beneficiaries.  The survey touched on how 8.2% of claims were underpayments.  As the Comptroller and Auditor General pointed out, there was a mix of underpayments and overpayments.  People might believe that getting an overpayment is grand, but it causes difficulties for older people further down the road when they are hit with the repayment bill.  I know of a woman who this year received a bill where &euro;100,000 was the magnitude of the cumulative overpayment.  She took a hit through no fault of her own.  When her situation was reviewed, she was well into her 80s.  The survey showed that 38% of claimants aged over 80 years were in receipt of an incorrect rate.  Will Mr. McKeon briefly summarise the measures that the Department has taken to address the levels of irregular payments revealed in the control survey in January?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019110700002#S00300","speaker":"1218","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1573117200,"counter":254,"content":"<p>The study on the non-contributory State pension also addressed the reasons.  The purpose of the control survey was to inform our control activity in specific schemes and provide us with an estimate of the overall levels.  The information from that survey showed that the risk areas were people over 80 years of age.  In general, their circumstances had changed since they were awarded their pensions when they were 65 and they had not advised the Department of that change.  It might seem strange that someone who qualified for a means-tested payment when he or she was 65 somehow has more money at 80, but it happens.  It can happen because, for example, people inherit property or live in a household where someone else has passed away and they now get money but they have not told the Department about it.  When we then undertake a control review, we find out that they may have more means than were disclosed when they initially put in their claims, giving rise to overpayments.  Our approach is to behave reasonably in recovering overpayments.  We agree repayment schedules with people, which can be low in weekly terms but which we hope will recover the full amount over time.<\/p> <p>  In terms of changes going forward, the survey will inform the cases that we pick for review each year.  Every year, we undertake approximately 10,000 routine reviews outside the control reviews of the non-contributory State pension.  Obviously, we cannot review all 100,000 people on that payment every year.  Instead, we try to pick out specific cases.  We look at and contact the people over 80 years of age who were close to their means level when they originally got the pension.  We also send out reminder letters to people advising them that, if their circumstances have changed, they should tell us.<\/p> <p>  What often happens in these cases is that the estate ends up paying the amount.  The Social Insurance Fund and the Department are preferred creditors when estates are being wound up.  If someone ends up with much more money in a bank account at the time of his or her death, we will be made aware of it and will recover the money from the estate.  That could be a shock to the family.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019110700002#T00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. John McKeon"},{"type":"speech","time":1573117200,"counter":255,"content":"<p>Is that correspondence issued on an annual basis?

We expect that, by this year's end, the average processing time for carer's claims will be approximately 12 weeks over the full year.  It started off at 17 and is currently just under ten.  We expect to maintain or slightly improve that.  We would like it to be better, but they are complex schemes.  For example, an issue we have encountered may need to be considered from a policy perspective.  As we deal with process and staffing issues that clear out many of the difficulties, we are left dealing with the complexities of getting times down from ten to eight weeks.  As I may have mentioned last year, we are encountering issues.  I fully understand why if someone has a carer's or disability claim, the advice from the disability advocacy groups - they are absolutely right - is to get that claim in as early as possible because that establishes the person's entitlement date.  Often, however, people submit claims when they do not have their full medical reports.  We must then make decisions on incomplete claims, which delays the process.  From a policy perspective, we may need to think about whether we should change the entitlement date.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019110700002#T01200","nonspeaker":"Mr. John McKeon"},{"type":"speech","time":1573117200,"counter":265,"content":"<p>In its work with the advocacy groups, has the Department communicated that they are delaying processing?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019110700002#T01300","speaker":"1218"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1573117200,"counter":266,"content":"<p>We have said that, but to be fair to them, if I were a disabled person or carer and had to wait three weeks for my consultant to give me a report, I would be losing out on three weeks' payment, so I would prefer to submit an incomplete claim.

Every time I see the forms, I am shocked by their length.  I have gone through them.  On numerous occasions, we have looked to see whether we can simplify or streamline them.  In the case of the carer's allowance and benefit application forms, we spent a lot of time with Family Carers Ireland and used a collaborative approach in respect of the design of the form.  We work with the National Adult Literacy Agency on the design of our forms.  We set up a customer communications unit, which has taken responsibility centrally for all form design because, previously, it was done in each scheme area.  We hope that in the coming years, we will be able to refine them.  It is about a balance - giving somebody the opportunity to provide all of the information that might be required to decide a claim knowing that in each individual case, perhaps only half the information is required but that if we do not ask the question of everybody, we might not get it.  It is about achieving that balance.  This might sound counter-intuitive but when we work with advocacy groups, NALA and so on, trying to make the language simpler means that we break questions up, which means that we then lengthen the forms.  That is an inevitable consequence.  I acknowledge that we may have gone too far on that.  As we roll out our online applications, we are going through each claim form and trying to make the online version very simple so that people move from one screen to the next screen and it is not intimidating.  One of the issues about forms is that they are not as intimidating as they look but their sheer scale makes them look intimidating.

We then changed the online system again and repeated the process.  We have been going through an iterative process to try to make it very easy to use.  When we are comfortable that it is as good as it can be, we will promote it as the best means.  Even though we have not promoted it, 11,000 claims for jobseeker's were made online this year even though we have not told people it is available.  The appetite is there and we want to move in this regard.  Currently, 70% of claims are taken by post and 30% in person.  My ambition and that of the Department is for half of claims to be taken online.  Going back to the public services card, that is a critical enabler of that because when somebody is applying for a service online, he or she can see the eligibility of his or her existing claim status and his or her contributions.  One must be certain that the individuals who are coming online are the persons they say are.

The back page of the <i>Irish Examiner<\/i>on Tuesday covered Mr. McKeon's letter to the committee on that issue, and the article also featured a very fetching picture of Mr. McCarthy.  It mentioned the business case.  The line that caught my eye was Mr. McKeon's statement that the total fully allocated costs of the project to date come to &euro;67.7 million but a large portion of these costs would have been incurred even if the public services card had not been introduced.  Mr. McKeon stated that this was because the Department always sought to authenticate the identity of people claiming its services in any event.  When I read that line, the words of another Secretary General, who appeared before the committee, came flooding back because they were nearly exactly the same as those uttered by the Secretary General of the Department of the Taoiseach, Martin Fraser, when he spoke about the infamous strategic communications unit.  Following the scrapping of the spin unit, Mr. Fraser pivoted and said the Department of the Taoiseach would have spent the money in any case because all the guys were working in various press offices across various Departments and nobody lost their job afterwards.  The two things do not tally because there was, of course, a cost in establishing the strategic communications unit.  I put the same point to Mr. McKeon. On the one hand, he is saying the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection would have incurred the costs in any event but then talks about the savings.  I think he alluded to savings of &euro;20 million.  What is the real cost?  Obviously, the real cost is &euro;67.7 million but Mr. McKeon is trying to say there are counterfactual matters.

I will give an example.  PPS numbers always required an identity check regardless of the SAFE process.  Since the SAFE process was introduced, we have issued approximately 1 million of them, predominantly to new people coming into the State who do not have any identity with the Department.  We have always looked for documentary evidence such as birth certificates, passports or bank statements.  Irish people receive a PPS number at birth and the first time we come across them is when they make a claim.  Any time anybody made a new claim we always checked the identity.  Until the mid to late 1990s in many cases, we sent a social welfare inspector to the home.  We always incurred costs on identity.<\/p> <p>  I did not include the cost of sending social welfare inspectors to anyone's home.  I looked purely at using the process we were using for identity checks prior to the introduction of SAFE and how much it would have cost to keep doing it when issuing social services cards, pensions books and free travel passes.  At a conservative estimate, that cost would have come to between &euro;30 million and &euro;31 million.  The actual net additional cost is approximately &euro;37 million and that is genuine and sincere.  I acknowledge that the committee would expect, like Mandy Rice-Davies, that I would say that anyway but I was not involved.  I was not even in the Department at that stage and I was not in the Civil Service.  I was made Secretary General of the Department in 2017, the same year as this whole thing broke.  The easiest thing for me would have been to say there was a new broom, that everything until then had been wrong and that I was going to fix it.  I genuinely looked at the situation and the net cost is approximately &euro;37 million at most, in a conservative estimate.

One wonders about these academics, who tend to review other literature, written by other academics.  The practical reality on the ground, I am suggesting - our witness can take it from somebody who knows through hard graft experience -  is that this is an issue.  If we want to hide behind literature and peer reviews, there are nonetheless 108 front-line workers coming to this conclusion, including myself, and I have also spoken to some of the Department's own inspectors, current and retired.  I did not just dream this up to give our witness grief.  It is something of a dismissal to say that we have considered everything, this is the way that it is, one can like it or lump it.  I would most respectfully ask that Mr. McKeon seek out some research to see if early intervention is better across all of those schemes, but in particular the back to education one.  I see no justification to make somebody, who is geared-up and focused, hang around for a year, when they are best-placed on furthering their education, so that they can add value and more taxation to the other schemes that the most vulnerable are in need of.  We will leave that issue there.

For example, it has been said that when people walk into our offices our cameras can immediately scan their faces and collect biometric data.  None of that happens.  In terms of what we do, we process the photograph to create a biometric template.  We have always said that.  In replies to parliamentary questions we have always been clear that we produce an arithmetic template.  We have called it biometric and we say that on our website.  We say it in the frequently asked questions and comprehensive guide for the Committee of Public Accounts.  We do create a biometric template for our own purposes.  That is what enables us to identify issues of identity fraud.  The information does not leave the Department.  It is not on the card, it is not collected and it is not shared.

It is like a travel bond when one travels.  It is a payment of benefits to people, such as a redundancy payment, accrued pension contributions, holiday time or back wages where the employer is not in a position to pay the employees, because the employer is going bust.  Consequently, we pay it; the Social Insurance Fund steps in and makes that figure up.  It is like a bonding scheme.

We have already heard about the collateral undermining of the Comptroller and Auditor General and the comment should not have been made.  I have it in front of me and I have read it numerous times in different contexts.  Mr. McKeon should go back and read it.  The roll-out of the public services card is chapter 10 of the Report on the Account of the Public Services 2015.  Mr. McKeon quoted elements of good practice, which are in paragraph 10.18.  It states, \"Elements of a good practice business case were included in several documents examined.\"  That is true.  The next sentence begins with a big \"however\".  It states, \"However, there were a number of omissions or partially addressed matters.\"  There were five of them and we can start with the last of them.<\/p> <p>  They are \"A single project initiation document (PID) was not prepared\", \"There was no plan setting out how and when the project's benefits would be measured, and who was responsible\/accountable for their delivery\", \"Key dependencies were only partially assessed\" and so on, \"There was no initial assessment of DSP's capacity to deliver the project\" and so on.  They are set out in very factual way.  I do not have time to read the conclusions but Mr. McKeon can go back on them to see why we have questions about value for money, even before we speak about privacy or other matters raised by the Data Protection Commission, which I will not get into.  The conclusions indicate that it was originally intended that 3 million public services cards would be produced by the end of 2013 but by the middle of 2016, two and a half years later, 2 million cards had been produced.

The commissioner states that the public services card project has many moving parts and that the complexity of logic and terminology attaching to that makes any analysis, legal or otherwise, challenging.  It was to start out as an enabler for services, which would have been great, but the card, as a physical piece of infrastructure, serves little purpose today.  There is an ongoing shifting of policy and direction relating to the public services card which has led to what the commissioner says is a fragmented and insufficient approach.  There are many and significant deficits in logic and consistency.  This project was rolled out at a cost of &euro;67 million with, according to what Mr. McKeon has said, savings of &euro;30 million, which we will look at in due course.

There has been no function creep.  If there is a legitimate criticism of the public services card programme, it is that it did not happen at the pace at which it was meant to happen.

The staff resources required to support the project and the project costs were estimated.  Qualitative and quantitative benefits to the Department were estimated.

It takes time to realise benefits such as the capturing of data for administrative efficiencies, our not having to process second, third and fourth identity claims each time someone comes in and detecting fraud.

People should be clear that we did not dismiss the report out of hand.  It is not that we decided that we did not like the report and would object to it.  If we believed the report and its findings stood on their merits, we would have absolutely accepted them and I would be sitting here telling the committee that we accept them and that this is what we were going to do to deal with it.  However, it would be wrong to accept findings that we think are wrong.  There is no halo of infallibility on anyone, not on me, the Data Protection Commissioner or anyone else.  If we have learned anything from the financial crisis in the period from 2008 to 2012, it is that nobody is infallible, even a regulator.  We must respond to the best advice we receive.  The advice we have received from the Office of the Attorney General, the senior law officer in the State, is that what we are doing is perfectly in line with the law.  As Accounting Officer, I am not going to stop everything I do when the person whose job it is to advise the Government and me tells me that they are the senior law officer in the land and they say I am perfectly entitled to keep doing what I am doing and that we will deal with an enforcement notice should one arise.

A number of weeks ago, I mentioned the fact that I did not have a public services card.  Ms McCrum nicely wrote to me and offered the services of the Department if I wanted to get one.  I wrote back to explain that a couple of weeks ago, I think, I arranged by appointment to go into the branch office in Portlaoise, and I received my public services card in the post the following Thursday, so it is a very efficient service.  I have not had a reason to use it yet but I acknowledge the efficiency within the Department and the courtesy of the staff.<\/p> <p>  I want to raise one issue with the card.  The witnesses will be aware of it as it comes up at our meetings quite a bit.  I refer to the free travel aspect of the use of the card.  There has been a lot of confusion among many committee members who are trying to understand how the free travel card works and who has details of it.  We asked the National Transport Authority, representatives of which were before the committee a few weeks ago.  They said the matter was the Department's affair and that it needs to answer.  We have had issues with Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann regarding a particular case I highlighted in which a person received a bill for use of a free travel card where the card had been cancelled some months earlier.  The person should not have been using it.  I have been very clear on this.  That was not the issue I was talking about.  I was just curious about the use of the free travel card and how it is known what travel has been taken on it.<\/p> <p>  Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann has a system in place called a fixed penalty notice.  Most of us would not be expert on this, but the Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann representatives said this was available, but seemingly it has a separate process.  It can issue a bill, which is a civil matter separate from the fixed notice.  I am giving Irish Rail - or Iarn&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann, as it is - the benefit of the doubt.  In some cases it issued a specific bill to a specific person for the use of the card and based it on actual travel or journeys used.  I would never have contemplated that it would issue a bill for an exact figure without having details of it.  I was being generous in assuming it had the details but it told me the statement I made was untrue.  This is not a matter for the witnesses before us; it is background.  What is clear is that Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann has issued a bill to a person on the basis of a four-month period elapsing, whether or not it knows whether the card was ever used or how many times.  It has issued a bill just on the basis of time.  I find that even more disturbing than issuing a bill based on actual travel.  We have asked for clarification on that from Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann.  We will come back to the matter.  We were told recently in respect of the travel operator - in recent weeks we have had a couple of meetings at which this has come up - that when the card is used there is a number on it that the Department has such that it knows the trips that are taken on the card when it goes in and out through the machine on the platform, but it does not know who the person is.<\/p><p>This is the reference number the travel operator has and the Department can then match it to the individual.  The Department has details of the persons travelling through the public services card.  We will take it step by step.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019110700002#QQ05900","speaker":"1216","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1573117200,"counter":1049,"content":"<p>In some elements.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019110700002#RR00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. John McKeon"},{"type":"speech","time":1573117200,"counter":1050,"content":"<p>That information can be obtained from the card.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019110700002#RR00300","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1573117200,"counter":1051,"content":"<p>We can get some elements.

I have two or three questions on the public services card and JobPath.  Mr. McKeon might have answered some earlier but I will ask specific questions I have.<\/p><p>In a previous response, Mr. McKeon said that there is no halo of infallibility around anybody.  We can accept that, whether we are talking about Mr. McKeon, the Data Protection Commissioner, me or the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  This is a serious issue.  Our job is to probe reports which are prepared by statutory bodies.  When the Comptroller and Auditor General produces a report, it is our job to put questions to the Accounting Officer who is subject to that report.  In this case, we have had a report from the Data Protection Commission, which is also a statutory body.  Reference was made to high-level findings.  The Data Protection Commissioner sets out three high-level findings in the first few pages of her report.  Mr. McKeon says that he does not agree with those findings on a point of law, which is fine and that is his right.  The difficulty that we have is that either the Department is right or the Data Protection Commission is wrong.  If the Data Protection Commissioner is wrong on three very high-level findings then, given that we are talking here about a statutory body whose job it is to protect and safeguard peoples' information and data and ensure it is used in an appropriate way, one way or the other we have a serious problem.  It is not a question of a nuanced difference; it is fundamental.  It is now being disputed on a point of law.  I assume there will be an enforcement order that will be in line with the letter cited by Mr. McKeon.  I imagine it will be appealed and ultimately, it will be dealt with in court.  One way or the other, for us as Oireachtas Members, there will be profound fallout from this.  This will have profound implications because somebody is wrong.  We will have to wait and see which party is wrong.  <\/p><p> There is one other issue with the public services card, which is important.

This is relevant to our earlier discussion on write-offs.  I asked for details on the outstanding customer debts.  I only asked for the large figures, over &euro;10,000, by scheme area at the end of August 2019.  I asked for the number of cases where payment plans were in place and the number of cases where no repayment plan was in place.  According to the schedule in the reply, there are 5,638 cases where a repayment plan is in place and the value of the debt for which the repayment plan is in place is &euro;156 million, and no repayment plans are in place for 6,075 cases and the figure is &euro;171 million.  In those cases, for all the schemes, the majority have no payment plan in place.  <\/p> <p>  I then sought details on the outstanding customer debts with a value outstanding of, again, over &euro;10,000.  I did not want to a lot of paper so I just kept to that limit, and asked for an age analysis.  According to the chart, in terms of repaying and not repaying, the figure adds up to &euro;327,000.  They are the same figures with these now broken down by an age analysis rather than scheme.  The first half of the reply was by scheme and the latter half was by aged analysis.  The Department has a case from 1984, where a person owes &euro;119,000 and the person is repaying, and two cases of debts, totalling &euro;28,000, where there is no repayment plan in place, going back to 1984.<\/p> <p>  I estimate that between 1984 and 1989 the Department is owned &euro;1.5 million by 100 people.  That is a long time owed.  Between 1990 and 1999 there is &euro;16 million owed in respect of approximately 600 cases.  Between 2000 and 2009, there is approximately 1,900 cases amounting to &euro;77 million.

I am grateful to the committee for this opportunity to offer my perspective on these issues.<br\/><br\/>The existing business model of social media and search platforms, which is based on extracting and monetising as much personal data as possible from users while encouraging them to engage addictively with and return to the platforms, is a foundation for the serious problems we are discussing today.  It is a vicious but highly lucrative circle in which clickbait material of hate, outrage, conspiracy and tribalism proves the most engaging, while the micro targeting of ads and content means only a select receptive audience may ever see material that becomes impossible to refute.<br\/><br\/>Too often, policy discussions focus on the risks posed by social media in established democracies, but the most vulnerable victims are, ironically, those who fight most courageously on behalf of democracy, namely, human rights defenders.  For them, online threats can swiftly descend into violence, arrest, torture or death.  Activists do not wish to leave the platforms because, despite their serious flaws, they are a major tool of democracy.  They allow anonymity, communicate helpful information or help spread irrefutable evidence, and offer easy-to-use encrypted messaging.  Many of the proposed solutions and interventions to social media problems, such as the banning of online anonymity or account registrations being tied to formal identity, only exacerbate the problems.  If we better understood and more adequately addressed the serious risks and harms to human rights activists, we could better resolve the problems for all of us because studies indicate human rights activists are the outriders for these dangers.<br\/><br\/>In 2017, Front Line Defenders, an Irish-based international human rights NGO, analysed data on the murders of 312 activists.  In 84% of these cases, the activists had received threats, often made online.  As the organisation noted, the world's worst regimes know well that attacking the legitimacy and credibility of human rights defenders softens the ground and lessens the reaction when they are arrested, imprisoned or murdered.  Women activists are regularly the recipient of some of the most loathsome and sexually explicit threats.  In a survey of eight countries carried out last year, Amnesty International found that more than 40% of women who had been abused online feared for their physical safety and 24% feared for their family's safety because online mobs often issue graphic threats against their children.<br\/><br\/>Facebook has been particularly implicated in human rights reports, ignoring anti-democratic campaigns on the site and inexplicably viewing despots as opportunities to extend platform reach.  For example, in the Philippines, Facebook eagerly helped the Duterte campaign learn more about social media use and considered him to be, in its own words, a king of social media engagement, even though his vigilante drug squads were already well-known for carrying out summary executions.  The UN harshly criticised the company for its failure for many years to shut down co-ordinated threats that scaled into violence in Myanmar.  One Myanmar legislator concluded that Facebook had been dangerous and harmful to the country's democratic transition.  Avaaz, a human rights organisation, recently condemned the company for similarly failing to curtail violent threats to vulnerable minorities in Assam.  Similar difficulties arise with Twitter, YouTube and any other platform that can carry a message, photo or video.<br\/><br\/>Human rights organisations have stated that platforms regularly back down in the face of government requests to remove posts by or accounts of journalists, activists and organisations.  Acceding to a request of the Indian Government, Twitter recently took down 1 million tweets relating to Kashmir.  Activists have been deplatformed in Vietnam.  Algorithms that encourage and promote engagement also enable co-ordinated hate and disinformation campaigns such as a fake accounts broadcast propaganda campaign in Sudan to commend military generals who massacred demonstrators last summer.<br\/><br\/>The platforms need key reforms that will protect pro-democracy activists and start to remedy abuses elsewhere.  They should work more extensively with trusted regional and local NGOs to better understand the context of government requests for content and account takedowns.  They need to be more aware of and vigorous in assessing possible future harm and interference caused by their actions and promotional programmes.  Governments and regulators should foreground risks to activists as they consider ways to manage online problems.  Too many proposals undermine grassroots movements toward democracy and are as much a threat to democracy as the online harm they hope to combat.  States and regulators will not address these broad problems unless they terminate the core surveillance capital business model of platforms and reduce their operational size to a level such that platforms can begin to manage and fix these problems.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22019110700002#B00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Karlin Lillington"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1573084800,"counter":1321,"content":"<p>I thank the Chair and the distinguished members of the international committee.  I represent Brave, a private web browser.  Our CEO, Brendan Eich, invented JavaScript and co-founded Firefox.  Since those early days, as all members are aware, the web has become grimy.  Millions of people use Brave to make the web safe, fast and private.  The problem of disinformation arises because of what happens every time one loads a web page.  As the page loads, a broadcast of information about the user is sent to tens or hundreds of companies.This is intended to allow technology companies that represent advertisers to compete for the opportunity to show the user an ad.  That sounds fine, but the broadcast data includes an inference of the user's sexual orientation, political views, religion, and any health issues from which he or she may suffer.  It generally includes the precise thing the user is watching, listening to or reading at that moment, as well as where he or she is located.  These data are bundled with identification codes for the user that are as specific to the user as his or her social security number.  All the data I described can be put into a dossier about the user, whatever age he or she may be.  This is a description of the multibillion dollar real-time bidding, RTB, industry.  The broadcasts occur hundreds of billions of times per day.  My written submission contains plenty of footnotes with evidence for this.  This relates to perfect information from micro-targeted disinformation.  I should say that I did not set a timer, but I will not filibuster.<br\/><br\/>It is almost certain that every voter in every election has been profiled based on almost everything they watch, read and listen to online.  That is problem number one.  The second problem is that the real-time bidding industry, which involves advertising, is a cancer eating at the heart of legitimate media.  That works in at least two ways.  If a person visits the website of <i>The Irish Times<\/i>, for which I used to work and for which Dr. Lillington currently works, and reads about a luxury car, and then later in the day that person goes to a less reputable website, it is very likely he or she will be targeted with an ad for a luxury car because the companies that received the information profiling that person as a high-value <i>Irish Times <\/i>reader interested in cars can now, at a significant discount, show him or her the ad on the poor quality website.<br\/><br\/>That happens even if one is not human.  What about an ad for a bot?  Not only does audience arbitrage, as it is referred to in the industry, commodify a worthy publisher with a unique audience, it also allows a criminal to operate fake people who pretend to view and click on ads.  This diverts an estimated $5.8 billion to $42 billion per year from worthy publishers out of the wallets of real advertisers and into the pockets of criminals.<\/p><p> There is a glimmer of light, though.  I admit that it comes from my company.  We have been pioneering a new system of private ads that are opt-in.  The engagement rate has been sky high over the past six months.  We are proving that privacy can be good business.<\/p><p> We at Brave urge the grand committee's distinguished members to take a single specific action, that being, to pressure with their intergovernmental weight the two entities that control this global system.  The first is called the Interactive Advertising Bureau, IAB.  Its largest members are Facebook and Google and it controls the rules about how real-time bidding, RTB, works and what can be in a broadcast.  The second is Google itself, which has its own proprietary version.  We have given detailed evidence to 16 regulators through colleagues across Europe and we have seen investigations triggered under GDPR into both entities.  This is good.  Twelve months later, though, we are still awaiting enforcement.<\/p><p> If there is one thing we can leave the grand committee with, it is a plea to stop the business model of the bottom of the web and starve the data brokers who enable micro-targeted disinformation.  There is an easy way to do that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22019110700002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Johnny Ryan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1573084800,"counter":1323,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Ryan for concluding on time.

I will reinforce everything that Dr. Ryan said.  Everyone should think of that as the fundamental backdrop to what I am saying.<\/p> <p>  In the US and other countries, the institutions of liberal democracy are losing their ability to serve the needs of constituents.  Many factors contribute to this.  Historically reduced funding has been a major one, but, increasingly, the dominant role of technology in society is undermining the ability of liberal democracies to operate.  Internet platforms have exploited the weaknesses of democratic institutions and accelerated their weakening.  Platforms have positioned themselves to replace democratic institutions with initiatives such as Alphabet's Sidewalk Labs waterfront project in Toronto, Facebook's Libra cryptocurrency, Amazon's efforts in law enforcement and Microsoft's services for governments.  The success of Internet platforms has produced harm to public health, democracy, privacy and competition on a global basis.  The driver of that is the algorithmic amplification of hate speech, disinformation and conspiracy theories as well as micro-targeted advertising based on massive surveillance.  Similar to the chemicals industry of the 1950s and 1960s, Internet platform profits are inflated because the industry does not pay the cost of the harm it causes.  This is important.  As Professor Shoshana Zuboff has noted, Internet platforms are gradually displacing democracy and consumer choice with algorithmic processes.<\/p> <p>  To protect competition, governments have an existing anti-trust toolkit.  To protect public health, democracy and privacy, however, they need new tools.  They need to constrain the business model of surveillance capitalism.  The best way to do this is to declare that personal data are a human right, not an asset.  This would limit business models to first party intended uses of data.  There would be no third party commerce or use of private data, no predictive models based on personal data, no web tracking and no corporate surveillance.  In this, I would like to go beyond the Brave solution.<\/p> <p>  Internet platforms behave as though governments lack the tools and political support necessary for meaningful regulation.  Our challenge is to prove them wrong.  We have to be prepared to shut them down for periods of time when they misbehave, given that they are clearly defying democratic governments and will persist in doing so until there is an incentive to change.  I have spent 34 years as a technology investor.  At one time, I was a mentor to Mark Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg.

I will focus my comments on electoral interference and large-scale disinformation operations because these are what I study on a regular basis.<\/p> <p>  This is a vast and fast-moving problem set.  According to the Oxford Internet Institute, 70 countries are now reported to be running organised social media information operations, up from 48 last year.  We do not have enough data to prove whether this stems from a rise in operations, a rise in reporting or both.  Either way, it indicates a global phenomenon.  Most of these operations are aimed at domestic audiences, but we must remember that the Russian operation that targeted the US from 2014 onwards also started out by targeting the domestic opposition.<\/p> <p>  The evidence suggests that a state that has the capability to run domestic information operations can quickly pivot to external targets if the political need is there.  Russia did so in 2014.  Saudi Arabia did so after the murder of Jamal Khashoggi.  China did so when the Hong Kong protests began.  Nor is this limited to state actors.  We saw the far right in Britain and America trying to interfere in the French presidential election in 2017.  These operations do not solely play out on social media platforms.  They also include websites and television stations.  They can include on-the-ground events and local activists, some of whom are unaware of the role they are playing.<\/p> <p>  All of these problems are underpinned by a perception that online information operations are easy, cheap, effective and profitable.  Since 2016, the narrative has emerged that Russia managed to tip the balance in the US election by running social media trolls.  That narrative is significantly flawed, but it has caught on.<\/p> <p>  Unscrupulous marketing companies around the world are promising to \"change reality\" for their political clients through social media campaigns.  Fake amplification on social media is very cheap.  One can buy a three year old YouTube channel with videos already uploaded for just $1.  Domestic actors on both sides in the US have experimented with Russia&rsquo;s playbook.<\/p> <p>  However, we also know that the environment in 2019 is much less permissive than it was in 2016.  The platforms, law enforcement and open source researchers are all actively hunting influence operations online.  The rate of takedowns has accelerated dramatically since early 2018.  Over the past 12 months, we have seen more than 50 takedowns just from Facebook, covering operations from some two dozen countries.  That has forced interference operations to sacrifice engagement to stay concealed.<\/p> <p>  In this environment, I bring four urgent needs to the committee's attention.  These are not the only four, but they are the areas where parliamentary work can have most immediate impact.  First and of most direct relevance to elections, parliaments and political campaigns must urgently improve their own cybersecurity to prevent the sort of hack-and-leak operations that Russia used to such devastating effect in 2016.  This is not a duty that can be passed on to the social media platforms.  Every parliament and every campaign should ensure that all its staff have cyber training and contingency plans in place.  This is expensive and many campaigns will argue that the money would be better spent on ads, but it is much less costly than seeing their emails leaked to the press a week before the election.<\/p> <p>  Second, we do not yet have a deterrence system in place.  We have seen individual nations react to interference attempts, but we do not have a credible system for imposing unacceptable costs on foreign actors who attempt to interfere in elections.<\/p> <p>  Third, we need legislation that imposes systematic costs on the commercial operators who sell fake accounts or hire out their interference campaigns.  Two weeks ago, we saw the first case of the Federal Trade Commission fining a US company for selling fake engagement.  Social media companies can, and do, ban such operators from their platforms, but they cannot impose a direct financial cost.  The black market in fake accounts is the easiest place for hostile actors to buy their assets, as China demonstrated over the Hong Kong protests.<\/p> <p>  Fourth, parliaments should lead discussions on how to reduce polarisation online, both through regulation and through education.  This is a long-term challenge, but we should always remember that if we did not have domestic trolls, the foreign trolls would not have anyone to pretend to be.  Such discussions will require technical analyses of how the platforms' algorithms suggest friends and content for users, but they will also require social analysis of how users select their online identities and tribes and how they can be encouraged to broaden them.  Every human has a complex pyramid of identities in real life, but the dynamics of social media often reduce that to one-dimensional tribalism.  If our parliaments can work across party lines and lead the debate on how to reverse the spiral of ever narrower partisan groups online, that would mark a step towards reducing the scope for online polarisation and online interference.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22019110700002#C00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ben Nimmo"},{"type":"speech","time":1573084800,"counter":1327,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Nimmo.

When I accepted the invitation, I thought that its British MP members would be in attendance.<\/p><p>The fact they are not here today because Parliament was suspended two days ago in preparation for a general election is profoundly disquieting on many levels.  The UK Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee, DCMS, has painstakingly detailed the risks to our elections, and yet the Government called this election having done absolutely nothing to address them.  It has failed to undertake any of the committee's recommendations, which is a gross dereliction of its duty to protect the British public.<br\/><br\/>Nobody can be in any doubt about the risks to our democracy that are posed by these Silicon Valley tech platforms.  I have spent three years investigating these risks and we now know many facts.  We know the Brexit vote was fraudulently and illegitimately conducted.  We know the tech platforms, particularly Facebook, facilitated multiple campaigns to break the law.  We know the authorities have entirely failed to hold these perpetrators to account.  We know that Britain is set to leave the European Union on the basis of this fraudulent and illegitimate vote.  The failure to reckon with these crimes has led to a situation where the man who led one of these campaigns, Vote Leave, which carried out the single biggest electoral fraud in my country for more than a century, is now the Prime Minister, and the man who masterminded this scheme is his chief adviser.  This is not a situation that should exist in any well-functioning democracy.  Britain is now a warning to the rest of the world because what happened in our country could happen in this country too.  The vast unchecked power of the Silicon Valley technology companies represents a truly global risk, and it is not even clear that democracy will survive them.<br\/><br\/>It is absurd that I am here today but another invited witness, Mark Zuckerberg, is not.  The contempt he has shown to the nations represented here is extraordinary.  We are in a truly staggering situation where a single company plays an absolutely central and pivotal role in elections in almost every single country across the world, yet it is answerable to none of them.  This cannot and should not go on.  I urge Congressman Cicilline to invite the committee to Congress for its next hearing.  Mark Zuckerberg needs to be subpoenaed by this committee.  He needs to answer proper, rigorous and informed questions.  I believe Mark Zuckerberg has deliberately misled Congress.  Two weeks ago, Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez asked Mark Zuckerberg when he and Sheryl Sandberg learned about Cambridge Analytica.  He said he could not remember but he thought it was in March last year.  This simply does not bear scrutiny.<br\/><br\/>The entire story that Facebook has told about Cambridge Analytica, including who knew what and when, is crumbling.  Throughout 2017, I and other journalists were writing about the company and we now know, thanks to the SEC report, that Facebook had being lying to reporters, including me.  That, essentially, means it was lying to shareholders.  We know that Facebook employees knew about Cambridge Analytica abusing Facebook data before even the very first report by Harry Fox Davis in <i>The Guardian<\/i>, again thanks to the SEC report.  Mark Zuckerberg claims to have known nothing until March last year.  This defies belief.  Yesterday, we learned that the California Attorney General had tried to subpoena emails between Mark Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg that would clarify all of this, but Facebook has repeatedly refused to hand them over.  One has to ask why and what exactly it is that Facebook is trying to hide.<br\/><br\/>Facebook cannot be trusted to run the world's elections.  No company can.  I hope the company moves towards a total ban on micro-targeted political advertisements and that it seeks to obtain the forensic evidence of what actually happened on Facebook's platform in 2016 in the US election and the EU referendum.  This information cannot remain the private property of a private company.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22019110700002#C00700","nonspeaker":"Ms Carole Cadwalladr","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1573084800,"counter":1330,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Cadwalladr.

My first question is to Mr. Ben Nimmo.  I admire his dedication and his previous work in the Atlantic Council's DFRLab.  I echo Mr. Nimmo's comment that disinformation operations are not some sort of innocent, so-called meddling.  Rather, they are blatant attacks against the core of democratic states.  In Russia, as we know, they are part of the military doctrine.  They are used as weaponry tools, and should be treated as such.  Hence, a proper co-ordinated international response is definitely needed.  It is something we have been missing thus far.<\/p> <p>  There have been recent examples of how Russia-backed influence networks and the manipulation techniques were used in Africa.  They did not use faked profiles created in the St. Petersburg troll factory on that occasion: they hired locals.  They basically bought their locals' profiles.

I would nuance the African finding slightly.  There was a combination of fake profiles and genuine profiles and they were using some genuine people on the ground.  It also looked like they had bought accounts from people.  One of the problem sets here is the black market in recycled accounts.  Something that we have seen consistently over the last three or four years is information operations taking more steps to try to hide because they are being hunted more.  The latest take-down of probable Internet research agency accounts was announced approximately one week before the African announcement.  They were going to extraordinary lengths to try to hide their traces.  Mostly, they were copy-pasting genuine American comments.  This means that one has to be looking for signals that are not content based because the content is all coming from somewhere else.  It also means that they are getting much less engagement because if all they are doing is parroting somebody else's words then they do not have their own voice.  <\/p> <p>  I think what we will see is more attempts to masquerade as other people.  We have already seen many attempts to co-opt local activist groups.  Part of the challenge is going to be communicating with activist groups ahead of the elections and teaching the broader electorate the type of cautionary steps they need to take before engaging with somebody else's Facebook group, which is asking them to take action on the ground.  We need to teach them how to verify who is behind that.  There are basic steps that one does in real life that people seem to forget online.

It is a business model based on capturing and maintaining attention.  Please do not be distracted by what in the United States we call First Amendment issues or free speech issues.  Algorithmic amplification is a business choice.  It is completely independent of speech.  One can put all voices onto social networks without harm.  Where the harm comes in is that the amplification looks to the most basic elements of evolutionary psychology, specifically , flight or fight.  That is why outrage is so effective.

I have two questions which I will tie together and try to keep as brief as possible.  The first relates to an incident from social media yesterday.  As we know, the British general election is under way and we miss the presence of our British colleagues, with the exception of Lord Puttnam who is with us.  The official Twitter account of the Conservative Party sent out a tweet with a mock-up of the Opposition Brexit spokesperson, Keir Starmer, poised to answer a question he was not asked.  This is possibly the first time the headquarters of a mainstream political party has run fake news.  We have seen this from many fringe actors but this is probably the first time I have seen a mainstream party officially engaging in fake news.  It is probably no surprise because the main protagonist in that party is on the vote leave side.<\/p> <p>  Have we reached peak social media difficulty?  The flipside of that question is that, as legislators, we have to anticipate the counter-arguments and play devil's advocate to some extent.  With every new technology, from Gutenberg's printing press to the Pony Express when riders crossed the United States on horseback delivering telegrams, come those who will exploit these technologies.  We were discussing this issue last night.  Regulators and legislators have always tried to clamp down and sometimes it takes a while to get on board.  Sometimes the public get on board faster and apply their own filter by taking fake news or, previously, a bogus telegram with a grain of salt.  I fervently believe legislation and regulation are needed.  To what extent have we reached a peak?  Are people moving off the platforms already or will they remain an ongoing threat for some time?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22019110700002#G00400","speaker":"1323"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1573084800,"counter":1375,"content":"<p>I would like to make a quick point that we need to recognise that democracy, as a global aspiration, will be undermined when the political leaders of the countries that are supposed to be the central democracies are themselves using social media to lie, spread disinformation and question and undermine elections.

Mr. McNamee spoke about stuff that triggers a fight or flight reaction as well as hate speech, conspiracies and disinformation.

I bring apologies from Damian Collins, MP, for whom I was supposed to act as sidekick.  Suddenly, I have become the main part of the show.  One point I would like to get across is that my select committee would very much like to take evidence from the witnesses.  We have a problem because unless we get that evidence, either in writing or orally, I cannot use it in our select committee report.  The witnesses will definitely receive invitations and we will find a way of circumventing those obstacles.  There is a wonderful irony here.  I am an unelected politician, yet the one security I have is that I know our select committee will be reformed in January, whereas if I was in the House of Commons, I would have no such certainty.<\/p><p>It is a rather bizarre situation in which to find oneself.  As I see it, we are on the horns of a major dilemma.  The bad actors - Russia, China and whoever else - have no real interest in achieving specific outcomes, which is very unusual.  They do not, for example, really care who wins the British election.  What they care about is seeding confusion, disharmony and disrespect for democracy.  The very worst that could happen - I suspect it might happen on 12 December - is that there would be a contested election.  That would be a massive win for the people who wish to deal in disinformation.  I have no idea what the result will be.  Likely as not, it will end up in the Supreme Court.  There is irony in all of this.  The more one can create confusion, the more one justifies the sovereignty of the social media companies because, in their competence, they begin to look as if they are almost a safe haven, as opposed to the incompetence of plural democracy.  That is a very serious problem and the problem is amplified by the fact that within our own nation states, going by all of my experience of 20 years of legislation and as I am sure Mr. Cicilline will confirm, if a government wants to defeat something that is coming at it, it will try to split ranks and sow confusion.  What is happening is that each nation state is looking at the benefits of employment, the tax take and so on versus its own security and the security of democracy.  That becomes an internal discussion within each country.  It is certainly true in the United Kingdom, Ireland and other countries.  It further confuses the entire issue.<\/p><p> We are looking at various possible solutions.  I totally support everything Ms Cadwalladr said.  What she did not mention that is bang up to date is the suppression of the Grieve report.  We have a report that has been right the way through all of our institutions, but the Prime Minister personally has refused to release it.  We had a question in the House of Lords on Tuesday when the Front Bench spokesman, the Minister, confirmed that it was a personal decision of the Prime Minister.  That is outrageous.  Our entire democracy relies on what is termed the \"good chap\" principle, that the Prime Minister of the day, man or woman, behaves like a good chap.  I am sorry about the gender inflection, but that is the way it is.  We are going through a process, whereby all norms are being defied.  That is playing to the benefit of the major social media companies, which is very worrying.<\/p><p> We have had one suggestion made to us as a committee by which I am intrigued, namely, the possibility of having a Euro SWAT team of high competence that could be moved around in situations where there was palpable vulnerability to democracy on the grounds that the problem was so enormous no one country would be able to put together the permanent competencies to deal with it.  Having a European SWAT team that would be constantly looking for it and that could be moved around might be one at least temporary answer to the problem we are discussing.  Does anyone have a view on it?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22019110700002#G02200","nonspeaker":"Lord Puttnam","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1573084800,"counter":1394,"content":"<p>On having a SWAT team, absolutely, what we need is far more investigators in this space who would do this work all the time.

I would not, however, want to see a Euro SWAT team run by governments because giving governments the right to decide what goes up and what comes down is fundamentally something to which I would object.  One nuance on information operations is that quite a lot of the time they do have an interest in achieving a specific outcome.  We could see, for example, that the Russian operation in 2016 was very definitely about stopping Hillary Clinton from being elected.  There are outcome-specific cases.  A lot of the information operations we see are about increasing polarisation.  That is where we need to have a conversation, not so much about the operations but about the underlying social dynamic of why polarisation happens in the first place.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22019110700002#H00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ben Nimmo"},{"type":"speech","time":1573084800,"counter":1395,"content":"<p>We will move to Congressman David N.

It is essential that we work together to find solutions to restore the Internet's promise.  The committee was established to work out some solutions to these problems, as Chairman Bob Zimmer noted during the last meeting, and I strongly support that goal.  To quote one of our panellists, Ms Cadwalladr, democracy is not guaranteed and not inevitable.  We have to fight and we have to win as we cannot let the tech companies have this unchecked power.  I want to begin with a question to Ms Cadwalladr.  I thank her for the incredible work she did in her extensive investigation and reporting on the impact of Facebook on elections and our democratic institutions.  Her work reinforces why a free and vibrant press is so critical to our democracy and holding those in power to account.  One of the challenges we face in the United States is having people understand the impact of this one-on-one micro targeting of politicals and issue advertisements and how they work.

Somebody who lives in the same house might be targeted with a different advertisement and people would not be aware of it.  This happens in darkness; therefore, it is influence being brought to bear on individuals based on unknown information that is being collected on them across the Internet.  It is a really different idea about politics and elections from those we have had at any other time.  It seems to be completely incompatible.  We previously had a situation where parties and politicians would come up with ideas and place them in the public domain.  We would have had a discussion about them and then voted on them.  Now they are finding out information on you and in what you are interested, crafting a particular policy that somehow might speak to it and showing it to you in darkness, as it were.

Imagine if the doctor repaired the arm and then said, \"I own your arm now.\"  That is what happens with data.

I will just hit some high points.  I thank the Chairman and the members of the Oireachtas Committee on Communications, Climate Action and Environment for inviting me to speak to it and the other International Grand Committee members today.  I am the vice president of content policy at Facebook and based in our Menlo Park headquarters in California.  I joined Facebook in 2012 after serving 11 years as a US public prosecutor and as regional legal adviser at the US embassy in Bangkok, Thailand.  I now lead Facebook's global content policy team.  My team's responsibilities include developing and enforcing the rules for how people can use our services.  My remit also now includes work to further our company&rsquo;s goal of facilitating appropriate regulation of content on social media platforms and the broader Internet.<\/p> <p>  Facebook welcomes governments and regulators taking a more active role in addressing harmful content online.  Protecting the people who use our services is a top priority, to which we continue to dedicate a great deal of time and resources, but we do not believe any company should tackle these issues alone.  This is why we work together with governments, civil society, experts and industry peers to develop rules for the Internet that encourage innovation and allow people the freedom to express themselves while protecting society from broader harms.  <\/p> <p>  The aim of the committee&rsquo;s session today is to advance international collaboration in the regulation of harmful content, hate speech and electoral interference.  Facebook shares this goal and I am grateful for the opportunity to share our thoughts on how to meet it. <\/p> <p>  Freedom of expression is a core value of our company.  Facebook exists to give people a way to connect and express themselves.  At the same time, we want to make sure that people using our services are safe.  That means we must make decisions every day about what is and is not acceptable among our community of 2.8 billion people.  Some of these decisions are clear but many are nuanced and involve balancing competing principles like voice, dignity, safety and privacy.  We work hard to get these decisions right and we have community standards that define what is acceptable content.  Those standards are informed at every turn by relationships with hundreds of civil society groups and experts around the world.  <\/p> <p>  We invest heavily in technical solutions to quickly identify potential violations of our rules.  For example, more than 99% of the terror propaganda we remove from the site is content we identify ourselves using technical tools before anybody has reported it to us.  We also have more than 10,000 people working around the clock to assess whether content is violating our rules and removing it if it is.  We respond to the overwhelming majority of reports of potential violations within 24 hours.  We publish transparency reports about how effectively we remove harmful content.  These documents, which are publicly available, show how much content we are removing in each category and how successful we have been in trying to identify that content before it is reported to us.  Nevertheless, we know that with such a diverse community, the lines we draw will never please everyone and we will never be perfect in enforcing these lines.  To address these challenges, Facebook is creating an independent body called the oversight board to which people can appeal our decisions on content they have posted but we know that this too will not solve all of the challenges we face.  We believe that a more standardised approach would be beneficial.  Regulation could set baselines for what is prohibited and guide the development of systems to better address harmful content.  <\/p> <p>  In the area of elections, regulation could address important issues such as the definition of political advertising, who is allowed to run political advertisements and what steps those persons must take before doing so.  Regulation could also address how political parties can and cannot use data to target political advertising.  We believe that Facebook and companies like it are central to solving these complex challenges but it is clear that we cannot and ought not do this alone.  In that spirit, we look forward to collaborating further with governments, civil society, industry and all of the people who hold a stake in creating rules for a safe and innovative Internet.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22019110700002#M00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Monika Bickert"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1573084800,"counter":1434,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for the opportunity to present to it today.  The committee's leadership on issues related to data governance inspires many well beyond Ireland's borders.  I am the retired chairman and co-CEO of Research In Motion, a mobile data services firm we scaled from an idea to $20 billion in sales.  My expertise is the commercialisation of technology, specifically for multi-sided platform business model strategies and their network effects.<\/p> <p>  In the attached appendix, I list the six recommendations I made at the IGC meeting in Ottawa in May.  Today, I will explain three foundational elements that underpin all of my recommendations because a stable, long-term solution to the current challenges lies in confronting them systemically.  <\/p> <p>  The current business model is the root cause of the problems the committee is trying to address.  Its toxicity is unrelenting.  It is not a coding glitch that a legal patch will fix.  Data at the micro-personal level gives technology unprecedented power and that is why data is not the new oil.  It is the new plutonium - amazingly powerful, dangerous when it spreads, difficult to clean up and with serious consequences when improperly used.  A business model that makes manipulation profitable is a foundational threat to markets and democracy.  Democracy and markets only work when people can make free choices aligned with their interests, yet companies that monetise personal data are incentivised by and profit from undermining personal autonomy.  Whistleblowers inside platform companies told us that \"the dynamics of the attention economy are structurally set up to undermine the human will.\"  That is why we need to outlaw the current business model and reintroduce responsible monetisation, such as subscription-based models.  Strategic regulations are needed to cut off the head of this snake.  Anything less means governments will be perpetually coping with its slithery consequences turning policymaking into a losing game of regulatory whack-a-mole.<\/p> <p>  Silicon Valley&rsquo;s business plans are not political programmes.  The contemporary technology sector is an industry that celebrates engineering as an alternative form of governance.  It distrusts the political process and disregards the public interest.  Its concentration of power is owed to the features of the modern knowledge-based and data-driven economy that tip markets through its steep economies of scale, powerful economies of scope, pervasive information asymmetry and network externalities.  Technology is not governance; it must be governed.  The choice we face in 2019 is not between Facebook and China, which paradoxically borrow from each other the tools and tactics that encode their grip on power.  The option we face is either a social choice mediated by democracy or social outcomes engineered by unbridled, unethical and unaccountable power.<\/p> <p>  A global digital stability board is needed to institutionalise co-ordinated responses and underwrite a progressive digital future.  Cyberspace knows no natural border.  The Cambridge Analytica scandal involved Canadian technology on a US platform paid for by Russian and US money to interfere in a British referendum over its future in the European Union.  The business model that enabled this, nourished by discredited neoliberal policies, turns customers into products.  If left unaddressed, it will render liberal democracy and free markets obsolete.  The timing is urgent.  In North America, record-setting lobbying expenditures by data-driven platforms resulted in chapter 19 of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, which includes provisions that lock in the current advertising-driven business model and prevent lawmaker oversight of algorithms.  The current US Administration is working to entrench these rules globally through the World Trade Organization negotiations on the trade-related aspects of e-commerce.<\/p><p>We have arrived at a new Bretton Woods moment where new or reformed rules of the road at the international level are needed.  They should be rules that preserve an open global trading system yet, at the same time, respect a nation&rsquo;s sovereign ability to regulate the data-driven economy's profound cross-cutting economic, security and social effects.  I have proposed the creation of an organisation that would be akin to the Financial Stability Board that was created in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis.  Industry can be part of the solution by acknowledging the toxicity of the current business model and migrating to responsible revenue generation for services.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22019110700002#M00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jim Balsillie","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1573084800,"counter":1436,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for the opportunity to join its deliberations today.  I lead YouTube's public policy work in Europe, the Middle East and Africa.  I have over a decade of experience in online safety issues and I am centrally involved in our work to keep our users safe every day.  This committee's work over the past year has addressed a range of critical topics, including privacy, misinformation, election integrity and more.  In our testimony before this committee previously, we outlined Google's commitment to information quality and how continued collaboration improves the ways we all address harmful content online.  Today, I will focus on YouTube's efforts and outline improvements we have made to address misinformation on that platform.  I will also highlight opportunities for greater collaboration among companies, government and civil society to tackle this challenge.<\/p> <p>  YouTube is an open platform where anyone can upload a video and share it with the world.  The platform's openness has helped to foster economic opportunity, community, learning and much more.  Millions of creators around the world have connected with global audiences and many of them have built thriving businesses in the process.  At the same time, YouTube has always had strict community guidelines to make clear what is and is not allowed on the platform.  We design and update our systems and policies to meet the changing needs of both our users and society.  Videos that violate those policies generate a fraction of 1% of total views on YouTube, and we are always working to decrease that number.  In fact, over the last 18 months, we have reduced the number of views of videos that are later removed for violating our policies by 80%.<\/p> <p>  Our approach towards responsibility involves four Rs.  We remove content that violates our policy as quickly as possible.  We raise up authoritative voices when people are looking for news and information, especially during breaking news moments such as elections.  We reduce the spread of borderline content and harmful misinformation.  We set a higher bar for what channels can make money on our site by rewarding trusted, eligible creators.  Over the past several years, we have used those four approaches to address misinformation.<\/p> <p>  While we remain vigilant against new threats, we are proud of the progress we have made.  We have raised up quality content by, among other things, implementing two cornerstone products, namely, the top news shelf in YouTube search results and the breaking news shelf on the YouTube homepage.  These products highlight authoritative sources of content and are now available in 40 countries.  We have worked especially hard to raise up authoritative and useful information around elections.  For example, earlier this year, we launched information panels in YouTube search results.  For example, when users were looking for information about official candidates running for seats in the European Parliament in May we showed them authoritative information.  We have continued our strict enforcement of YouTube&rsquo;s policies against misleading information and impersonation.  From September 2018 through to August 2019, YouTube removed more than 10.8 million channels for violation of our spam, misleading and scam policy, and more than 56,000 channels were removed for violation of our impersonation policy.  We have also undertaken a broad range of approaches to combat political influence operations, which we have regularly reported over the course of the past two years.  For example, in September, we provided an update about disabling a network of 210 channels on YouTube when we discovered they behaved in a co-ordinated manner while uploading videos related to the ongoing protests in Hong Kong.  We have also worked hard to reduce recommendations for content that is close to a policy line but does not violate it, including attempts to spread harmful misinformation.  Thanks to changes we have made over the past year, this type of content is viewed as a result of recommendations over 50% less than before in the United States.  YouTube has begun experimenting with this change in other countries, including Ireland and the UK, and we will bring it to other European markets soon.  We know that this work is not done.  That is why we continue to work with law enforcement, industry and third-party experts around the world to continue to evolve our efforts.<\/p> <p>  I will conclude by discussing opportunities for greater collaboration.  The EU code of practice on disinformation is an important foundation that we can all build on.  Launched just over a year ago, the code was developed in light of work that we and others had been pursuing with experts and publishers around the world to elevate quality information and support news literacy.  As part of the process, we have provided regular reports on our efforts to address disinformation and we have highlighted the work that we can do collectively in this regard.<\/p> <p>  We must continue to support collaborative research efforts.  For instance, we have invested in research on the detection of synthetic media, often referred to as deep fakes, and have released data sets to help researchers around the world to improve audio and video detection.  We have also made the data about our election advertising efforts available in the transparency report.  This information is available to everyone, including governments, industry and experts.  We can work together with this data to improve matters.  We strongly believe that addressing harmful content online is a shared responsibility, which is why we are so committed to meetings and collaborations like these.  We are committed to doing our part and we look forward to answering members' questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22019110700002#N00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Marco Pancini"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1573084800,"counter":1437,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for the invitation to participate in today's session.  I am the director of public policy for Twitter in Europe.  I am joined by my colleague, Mr. Ronan Costello, public policy manager for Twitter in Europe.  We are pleased to be here with the committee today for this session which aims to focus on how industry can be part of the solution.  Twitter is committed to improving the collective health, openness and civility of the conversation on our platform.  Our success is built and measured by how we help to encourage more healthy debate, conversations and critical thinking.  Conversely, abuse, malicious automation and manipulation detract from it.<\/p> <p>  I will use this opportunity to briefly walk through three specific areas where Twitter has been doing critical work to prioritise online safety and election integrity.  These include our investments in proactive technology to better enforce the Twitter rules, our policies on political advertising and synthetic or manipulated media, and our focus on state-backed information operations.  I will also share some insights into the structural and operational changes Twitter has made since 2017 to protect conversations on the platform during elections while building partnerships that promote a better understanding of our online environment.<\/p> <p>  It would be instructive at this point to re-emphasise the public commitment made by our CEO, Jack Dorsey, in May 2018 to prioritise the health of public conversation on Twitter above all else.  He recognised that the platform had come to be used in ways that were harmful and unforeseen and he said Twitter would hold itself accountable towards progress.  Since then, we have leveraged a combination of policy, people and technology to yield positive results.  It is our view that people who do not feel safe on Twitter should not be burdened to report to us, so we have significantly ramped up investment in proactive technology and tools to better tackle issues such as abuse, spam and automation, which detract from people having healthy experiences on our service.<\/p> <p>  More than 50% of the tweets we remove for abuse are surfaced proactively for human review by technology, rather than relying on reports.  This is an increase from 20% last year.  While we will strive to improve this further, it is a significant enforcement milestone and a positive indicator that our investment in technology is helping us to tackle abusive behaviour at scale.  Figures released just last week in the latest edition of our biannual transparency report further outline the trends and progress we saw in the first half of this year.  We have increased by 105% our rate of action on violating content.  We took action on 133% more accounts for violation of our hateful conduct policy.  We took action on 68% more accounts for violations of our policies on abuse.  Taken as a whole, the progress I have summarised reflects Twitter's mission and commitment to enhance the health of the public conversation on our service.<\/p> <p>  The scale, speed and targeting effects of online political advertising have been widely discussed lately.  Last Wednesday, our CEO announced that Twitter had made a decision to stop all political advertising.  This policy is global, includes all candidate and issue advertisements and will come into effect in the very near future.  We continue to update our rules and policies in response to evolving threats and technological challenges.<\/p><p>We share the public concern regarding the use of disinformation campaigns that rely upon the use of manipulated and synthetic media, commonly referred to as deepfakes.<\/p><p> On Monday, 21 October, we publicly announced that we have been working on a policy to address comprehensively synthetic and manipulated media on Twitter.  In the coming weeks, we plan to open a public feedback period to get input on this from the public.  We want to listen and consider a variety of viewpoints in our policy development process and we want to be transparent about our approach and values.<\/p><p> We appreciate that some of the threats on our platform can be urgent, and our expertise and analyses can be bolstered by partnerships with external researchers, journalists and academics.  One area where we have unlocked these valuable partnerships to help provide more transparency on our platform is in the area of state-backed information operations.  For more than a year, we have been publicly disclosing comprehensive datasets of tweets and related media information we identify on the platform that we have attributed to malicious state actors.  We launched this initiative to empower academic and public understanding of these co-ordinated campaigns around the world and to enable third-party expert analysis of these threats and tactics.  Using our archive, these researchers have conducted their own investigations and publicly shared their insights and independent analyses.<\/p><p> Since January 2017, we have launched numerous election related product and policy changes, expanded our enforcement operations and strengthened our team structure.  We further expanded our enforcement capabilities for global elections by creating a dedicated reporting feature to allow users to report content that undermines the process of registering to vote or engaging in the electoral process.  This reporting feature was first used this year for the Indian and European Parliament elections.<\/p><p> The challenges we face as an online society are complex, constantly evolving, and often without precedent.  Industry and Twitter cannot address these issues alone.  Nor is our industry monolithic in its approach to these issues.  Each of us has different services, varying business models, and often complementary but distinct principles.  This should be recognised as we continue our engagement.  Every stakeholder in this conversation has a role to play.  We propose a whole-of-society approach to improving the health of online conversation and citizenship.  We all need and deserve a thoughtful approach and long-term perspective in this discussion, and Twitter very much welcomes the opportunity to participate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22019110700002#N00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Karen White","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1573084800,"counter":1439,"content":"<p>We will start with Australia and I ask the witnesses to try to keep their answers as short as possible to give the parliamentarians time to question them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22019110700002#O00200","speaker":"1315"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1573084800,"counter":1440,"content":"<p>My first question is for Dr. Bickert.

With respect to false information, I understand it is very difficult to say what is false.  Something is false for one person and means something else to another person but hate speech is a much easier target to discuss.  For example, in Sri Lanka, people were burned alive because of the hate speech spread through Facebook.  In Myanmar, there was violence against the Rohingya minority.  I refer to what Facebook has done to prevent this.  It has more than 10,000 moderators, as Dr. Bickert mentioned, but what can it do with them?  The only way to address this is with an artificial intelligence, AI, solution.  Mark Zuckerberg told the US Senate in April 2018 that it might take five to ten years to have this kind of technology but that is not true.  A Finish company, Utopia Analytics, has offered to build Facebook a model in two weeks to get rid of the hate speech content originating in Sri Lanka but Facebook was not interested in it.  Many companies do AI moderation.  Will Dr. Bickert explain a little why Facebook will not go deeper into tackling hate speech and why it believes, with more than 10,000 moderators,  it can handle billions of messages?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22019110700002#P01100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tom Packal&eacute;n"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1573084800,"counter":1467,"content":"<p>I very much agree it is important to tackle hate speech.

We have very strict policies against it.  Our transparency report indicates that the majority of speech we remove for violating our hate speech policies is flagged by our automated systems before anybody has reported it to us.  That number is now is in excess of 65%.  Interestingly, Myanmar, is one of the areas where we have made the most progress.  Back when our detection efforts removed approximately 50% of the hate speech we found with automated technology, in Myanmar, our detection rate was at 63%.  We have focused on hiring people who are native language speakers and on building relationships with organisations on the ground that can help us spot trends.

Facebook is the most broadly used social network in Georgia.  It is the main source of information, especially among the younger generations.  That is why I have question for Dr. Bickert on Facebook's operational system.  In 2008, with Russia military intervention, Georgia experienced a severe cyberattack, which blocked critical digital infrastructure in the country.  Our citizens were denied access to Facebook.  In 2009, a similar cyberattack took place.  We had no access to Facebook and Twitter and one can imagine the effect of that when Facebook is most important source of information for the country.  That fact was brought to international attention and even <i>The New York Times<\/i>pointed out how vital web tools and services are becoming to political discourse and how vulnerable they are to disruption.  My question is whether, in 2019, Facebook has a policy to protect its users from political bullying or whether the company has a policy or any deterrent measures against countries which undertake attacks on Facebook users.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22019110700002#P01400","nonspeaker":"Ms Nino Goguadze"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1573084800,"counter":1470,"content":"<p>There is much to address in this question.<\/p><p>We think, however, that it is very important to maintain open access for the public to Facebook.  We have a team devoted to cybersecurity and that includes preventing hacking and cyberattacks, perhaps of the sort mentioned.  We also focus on disrupting what we call \"co-ordinated inauthentic behaviour\".  These are networks of accounts, sometimes state-run and sometimes not, trying to abuse our platform to share things such as divisive messaging, political messaging or intimidation.  We have a team focused on identifying and removing those instances.  It is not something we can do alone, so we partner closely with researchers, academics, security firms and others in the industry.  <\/p><p> Sometimes we will get a lead from somebody else, we will do the investigation and then we will remove that network.  When we do that, we are transparent about it and in our newsroom, we publish blog posts about the actions we have taken.  That has been a major area of investment for us.  Going after fake accounts has also been an  important part of disrupting bad activity that may, or may not, again come from state actors.  Our automated tools have got so much better that in the first quarter of 2019, we removed more than 2 billion fake accounts.  Not all of those were designed to share disinformation but we were removing the vast majority of these accounts within moments of their creation.  These are definitely areas of interest for us.

In its written statement, Facebook proposes to create an oversight body.  Who will be on that oversight body?  How independent will it be?  Will those members be paid employees of Facebook?  Will the body be funded by Facebook?  It also appears that this body will be an appeals mechanism for people who want content removed by Facebook.  We are here to ensure that social media platforms are safe environments and this does not seem to be helpful in ensuring we are working in a safe environment.  This oversight body is instead going to allow people who have their content removed to appeal to Facebook to have that content restored.  That is the opposite of what we are discussing.  I invite Dr. Bickert to talk to us about that oversight body and those questions first.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22019110700002#Q00900","speaker":"1315"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1573084800,"counter":1480,"content":"<p>We are launching the oversight board and while we do not think it is the perfect answer to all of these challenges, we think it is important to give people who have had content removed from Facebook the opportunity to appeal to an independent body.  To go quickly through the questions posed by the Chair, we put out a charter in September 2019 that was the result of nearly a year of consultation in many countries with many stakeholders from different backgrounds.  The result is that the board will have up to about 40 members.  Those members will be chosen through a collaborative process between the co-chairs of the board, who will be initially selected by Facebook.  Those co-chairs will then choose the additional members, with input from Facebook.  That said, the decisions made by those members will be independent and binding.  They will be paid by a trust that Facebook will fund, but those funds will be held and administered independently.<\/p> <p>  I will clarify the way that cases will get to this board.  We have millions of cases every week where we make decisions.  This board will be able to choose from among the decisions appealed to it by users.  If Facebook finds a case where it is hard to make a decision, we will also be able to proactively send something to the board for it to make a decision.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22019110700002#Q01000","nonspeaker":"Dr. Monika Bickert"},{"type":"speech","time":1573084800,"counter":1481,"content":"<p>The board, therefore, will be essentially funded by Facebook and Facebook will essentially be choosing who is on this oversight body.

The general media has literally ignored this issue.  On Facebook, its service users, people in wheelchairs, and others who have difficulties and so on, have responded.  There have been 35,000 hits.  RTE has not responded to this issue; it has ignored it completely.  The people my daughter and I represent are voiceless without Facebook.  Whatever about hate speech, I do not have Facebook, I do not read Facebook and I do not want to know what people are saying about me on Facebook, that saves me any concerns.  I am, however, concerned about an issue which is of such vital importance that, last Friday, the chief executive of the IWA told the 45 members of staff that they would be sacked on 29 November.  They had no voice and Facebook is the face and voice of the voiceless.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22019110700002#T00600","speaker":"1393"},{"type":"speech","time":1573084800,"counter":1580,"content":"<p>I am delighted to welcome our esteemed elected members and our esteemed associates from the social media.

I am pleased to have the opportunity to share details of the role of the Irish Data Protection Commission, DPC, and position in relation to the regulation of online platforms.<\/p> <p>  There is no doubt that despite the great benefits and access to more and more information the Internet has provided all of us with, it also presents significant challenges to our rights and freedoms in how it now operates.  The challenge of combating disinformation in many contexts, such as during electoral cycles or in, for example, public health scenarios is a pressing issue of our time given the negative consequences for democracies and societal well-being.<\/p> <p>  Issues of harmful and-or illegal content and disinformation are issues that stretch well outside of the scope of the data protection legal framework.  Data protection is predicated on a fundamental right of individuals to have their personal data protected and, as a result, the remedies individuals may avail of under the general data protection regulation, GDPR, require the personal data of that specific individual to have been processed.<\/p> <p>  The DPC is very pleased to have an opportunity for interaction during this panel with the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment as the DPC has this year responded to his consultation on the regulation of harmful online content and the implementation of the audiovisual media services directive.  In the context of making a submission to that consultation, the DPC clarified that it supported the Irish Law Reform Commission&rsquo;s recommendation in their 2016 report on harmful communications and online safety that a dedicated office with a statutory responsibility to promote online safety and to oversee and regulate a system of takedown orders for harmful digital communications should be considered.<\/p><p>The DPC, however, has responsibility for a number of areas of regulatory activity that relate directly to the theme of the hearing and are relevant to the panel.<\/p><p> First, it is possible that content relating to a specific individual posted online may be harmful to the individual or may contain false information about the individual.  In such circumstances, the individual may be able personally to exercise his or her data protection rights, in particular to erasure and rectification.  In circumstances where a platform does not comply with a request to exercise data protection rights by an individual, the individual may make a complaint to the DPC, following which we will take the matter up as appropriate on his or her behalf.  Equally, however, it is worth recalling that Article 85 of the GDPR requires a reconciliation of the right to freedom of expression with the exercise of data protection rights, and therefore they are not absolute rights.  The majority of complaints the DPC receives in respect of platforms are complaints about erasure.<\/p><p> Another issue of significance is the role that personal data play in a social media context through facilitating the so-called micro targeting of individuals with specific content, thereby amplifying any harmful effects of disinformation.  In such a scenario, the profile a platform has created of a user and the categorisation of that user as being of a certain lifestyle, passion or habit may allow an undecided voter in an election context to be pushed in one direction or the other.  All of this may happen without the user being aware his or her data are being deployed to reinforce the individual&rsquo;s existing viewpoint rather than the individual being in a position to take an objectively informed stance based on an understanding of both sides of an issue.  Given the rates of online users who consume their news exclusively on social media, this is a concern.  As a data protection authority, we have a number of ongoing investigations into how the online behavioural advertising system operates and whether in all respects it is in compliance with the GDPR, especially in respect of lawfulness and transparency to users.  In this regard, we have investigations open into platforms, data brokers and advertisement exchanges, which will conclude in 2020.<\/p><p> The issue of children and other vulnerable Internet users being subject to disinformation and harmful content somewhat overlaps with the protection of children&rsquo;s personal data in an online context.  To protect children, whether in respect of their personal data or to protect them from harmful content, presupposes that children can be identified as such on the Internet.  To date, a systemic solution to age verification online that protects younger users but leaves the Internet open and accessible to all has been elusive.  The DPC has watched with interest the attempts in the UK under the Digital Economy Act 2017 to impose age verification measures for access to legal online pornography.  That the legal provisions have not proceeded to implementation simply underlines how difficult it is to find a solution that meets all requirements.  The DPC has run a consultation over the past year on the protection of children&rsquo;s data, including a consultation directly with children through their schools and youth centres.  The DPC will next month publish a guidance note based on the outcomes of that consultation, proposing ideas and criteria that data controllers need to take into account when implementing mechanisms to identify and protect children online.<\/p><p> Finally, I raise an issue of interest to the committee, namely, that of how to foster international collaboration.  As an EU data protection authority, the commission is bound in close legal co-operation with all other European Economic Area data protection authorities.  Indeed, we meet in Brussels weekly.  In addition, the DPC is a member of the Global Privacy Assembly, has signed memoranda of understanding with a number of global data protection authorities, and this year we have been visited at our Dublin offices by a large number of other commissioners, including the New Zealand, Icelandic, Australian and UK commissioners.  The dialogue and the opportunity to discuss regulatory approaches and solutions to issues of common concern are invaluable in shaping better outcomes in our regulatory role.<\/p><p> I look forward to the panel discussion and questions from committee members.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22019110700002#W00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Helen Dixon","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1573084800,"counter":1623,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Dixon and invite Mr. Cesarini to give his opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22019110700002#X00200","speaker":"1315"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1573084800,"counter":1624,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for inviting a representative of the European Commission to this important event.  I am head of the unit responsible for media convergence and social media policy at DG Connect.  Respect for democracy, fundamental rights and the rule of law are core values of the European Union.  They bind us together and underpin the functioning of our institutions.  President-elect Ursula von der Leyen has announced that protecting European democracy will be a priority of the new Commission and underlined we must do more to protect our democratic processes and institutions from external interference.  Disinformation poses major challenges to our democracy as new technologies can be used, notably through social media, to disseminate disinformation on a scale and at a speed that are unprecedented.  They can create personalised information spheres and become powerful echo chambers for disinformation campaigns, polarise the public debate, and create tensions in society.  Media manipulation, however, and the strategic use of disinformation are not the exclusive prerogative of foreign actors.  Domestic actors, too, can exploit digital technology to interfere in electoral processes and, increasingly, to manipulate policy debates in areas such as climate change, migration, public security, health and finance.<\/p> <p>  While the conduct of free and fair elections is primarily a responsibility of member states, the cross-border dimension of efforts to manipulate democracy, as well as the importance of joined-up efforts to address such threats, make a European approach necessary.  What affects one member state affects us all.  The Commission, along with other EU institutions, has put in place a robust framework for co-ordinated actions against disinformation, with full respect for European values and fundamental rights.  We often mention free speech, freedom of association, press freedom, and pluralism, which are fundamental principles that need to be kept in mind.<\/p> <p>  Our work on combating disinformation has evolved over three major, interlinked initiatives.  Last December, the Commission adopted an action plan against disinformation, a plan that builds on the communication on tackling online disinformation and was adopted in April 2018.  Furthermore, in September 2018, the Commission put forward a comprehensive election package, setting out a variety of measures, with a focus on what were then the upcoming elections to the European Parliament.<\/p> <p>  Broadly speaking, the work carried out in recent months centred on the strength of action.  First, we improved the EU capability to identify and counter disinformation via our strategic communication task forces and the EU hybrid fusion cell, which operates within the European External Action Service.  Second, we supported member states by setting up a rapid alert system to facilitate the exchange of information between member states and the EU institutions.  The system has become a reference point for national authorities and a mechanism for strength and co-operation with platforms.  It also links up and facilitates co-operation with other international partners, not least the G7 and NATO.  Third, in the run-up to the European Parliament elections, we closely monitored the implementation of the code of practice on disinformation, to which the major online platforms signed up in October 2018.  The platforms, in particular Facebook, Google and Twitter, were subject to a programme of targeted monitoring that required them to report each month from January to May, inclusive, on the progress made on the implementation of their commitments under the code.<\/p> <p>  The monitoring was carried out in co-operation with the audiovisual authorities of the member states, the ERGA.  It focused on those actions that held particular relevance to the integrity of elections, namely, actions to disrupt the advertising and democratisation incentives for purveyors of disinformation; to ensure the integrity of the platform services against inauthentic behaviour, including fake accounts and malicious bots; and to ensure the transparency of political advertising.  In the final respect, searchable political advertising libraries were created and they resulted, for the first time insofar as online political advertising is concerned, in a better view of the identity of the sponsors, the amount spent and the basic targeting criteria used in the campaigns.<\/p> <p>  The fourth strand of actions included a number of initiatives directed to improve societal resistance to disinformation.<\/p><p>One of the aspects on which I wish to focus is the effort to promote media literacy, which is important to enable citizens to evaluate the credibility of information they encounter online and access alternative points of view when they navigate on social networks.  In the long run, media literacy initiatives may prepare users of online platforms and social media to better understand the effects of disinformation and the malicious actors with which they may be confronted.<\/p><p> We are facilitating the creation of a European multidisciplinary community of fact checkers and academic researchers.  The programme will arrive in 2020.  The Commission has supported investments in new technologies for content verification and network analysis through social media.  It has also launched a new platform, the Social Observatory for Disinformation and Social Media Analysis, SOMA, to facilitate networking, knowledge exchange and best practices among independent fact checkers.  The Commission will follow this up by founding a new digital infrastructure entitled the European Digital Media Observatory, which will offer tools and networking possibilities to link fact checkers and academic researchers to improve their understanding of the phenomenon and to exercise better oversight of the dynamics that disinformation shows online.  <\/p><p> Disinformation is a multifaceted phenomenon, which requires a multidimensional response.  Our preliminary view is that all the efforts I mentioned have contributed to narrow the space for malicious activities online.  On 29 October, we published a report that takes stock of the self-assessment reports prepared by the signatories of the code of practice.  Our initial view is that it is a mild kind of assessment.  After all, the recent elections to the European Commission were not free from disinformation and malign actors constantly change their strategies.  As such, we need to strive to be ahead of them.  The evolution of the code is ongoing.  When the full evaluation has been carried out, we will see what further actions are necessary.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22019110700002#X00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paolo Cesarini","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1573084800,"counter":1626,"content":"<p>My organisation, the Electronic Privacy and Information Centre, EPIC, was established 25 years ago to focus public attention on emerging privacy issues.  More than a decade ago, we worked with an organisation entitled Facebook Users Against the New Terms of Service.  It was an international campaign joined by more than 150,000 people on the Facebook platform to oppose changes in the company's policies that would diminish personal privacy.  As a consequence of the campaign, in 2009 Facebook gave commitments to its users that it would allow them to actively participate and vote on changes in its business practices.  At the time, this was viewed as a great success and a demonstration of how Internet governance could promote democratic principles.  However, Facebook reneged on its commitments and backed off on its agreement to allow users to vote.  Chillingly, it shut down the political organisations, including the Facebook Users Against the New Terms of Service group and prohibited the use of the company's name in any user group on the platform.  I bring this story to the attention of the committee because there has been much reference to Facebook and free expression.  I know from ten years ago the company's view on free expression.<\/p> <p>  Thereafter, EPIC and a group of consumer privacy organisations in the US went to the FTC and laid a charge that the changes in the company's business practices violated US trade law and, specifically, were unfair and deceptive.  We spent two years persuading the FTC to act on our complaint.  We provided evidence, legal analysis and the blueprint for the remedies that the FTC announced in November 2011.  Once again, we thought we had obtained a victory.  The then chairman of the FTC pointed to the settlement with Facebook and stated the company would be held to account.  When FTC commissioners appeared before the US Congress and in Europe, they pointed to the Facebook settlement as evidence that the US had effective protection for personal data.  However, we almost immediately became aware of a problem, namely, that the FTC was unwilling to enforce its legal judgment.<\/p> <p>  In a related case, Google changed its business practice in violation of a consent order.  We sued the FTC and stated that it must exercise its enforcement authority to protect users.  The judge was sympathetic to our case but concluded that she did not have the authority to force the commission to take the action it should have taken in 2012.<\/p> <p>  We have spent many years trying to get the FTC to act against Facebook.  During that time, complaints from many other consumer organisations and users have increased and include complaints about the use of personal data, the tracking of people who are not Facebook users and the tracking of Facebook users who are no longer on the platform.  A request lodged by EPIC under the US Freedom of Information Act uncovered that 29,000 complaints were pending against the company.  The FTC issued a judgment in June of this year against Facebook, accompanied by a historic fine of &euro;5 billion.  However, the FTC left Facebook's business practices in place and the users of the service at risk.<\/p> <p>  My message to the committee is simple: it must act.  It must not wait ten years or one year to take action against this company.  The terms of the GDPR must be enforced against Facebook and that should be done now.  Facebook should be required to divest of WhatsApp not because of a scheme to break up big tech but, rather, because the company violated its commitments to protect the data of WhatsApp users as a condition of the acquisition.  Until adequate legal safeguards are established, Facebook must be prohibited from engaging in political advertising.  Its recently stated views on political advertising and the US First Amendment, which are not shared by US legal scholars, are reckless and irresponsible.  Advertising revenue from political candidates should instead flow to traditional media organisations, which would help to support independent journalism.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22019110700002#Y00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Marc Rotenberg"},{"type":"speech","time":1573084800,"counter":1627,"content":"<p>I congratulate the committee members and other parliamentarians on this initiative.  The background to the regulatory environment in Ireland is very much set in our broad plan on online safety.  It involves several Departments, including the Departments of Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Justice and Equality, Health, Taoiseach, Children and Youth Affairs, and Education and Skills.  I am a former Minister of the latter Department, which provides strong online support mechanisms for students and schools.  The plan has a broad base.  The principles of what we are trying to do are clear and well set out in the committee's documentation.  They include transparency, accountability and protecting citizens while also respecting freedom of expression.<\/p> <p>  The devil is in the detail when it comes to regulation.  There are several main regulatory developments under way in Ireland.  I could name at least six.  The regulation of harmful online content, to which I will return, is being pursued by my Department.  The Department of Justice and Equality is facilitating a consultation on the regulation of hate speech and hate crime.  Regulation of transparency of political advertising has been developed in the context of an electoral commission that is being drafted and that will deal with the regulation of elections, including funding, which is another element.  Private Members' legislation supported by the Government has proposed the creation of new criminal offences relating to images displayed without consent.<\/p><p>Stronger protections relating to cybersecurity and cyberattacks are also relevant to my area.  The approach we are taking to online safety, for which I am directly responsible, is not dissimilar to that being taken in Australia.  We propose to define harmful content, require companies to have a code of practice and put an online safety commissioner in place to oversee the delivery of those codes of practice.  That online safety commissioner would receive third party complaints and could, on his or her own initiative, require takedown or notify companies that their code was inadequate.  Non-compliance with the directions of an online safety commissioner would be a crime and the commissioner could publish details of non co-operation.  That legislation is in development and we have had consultations on it, as Ms Dixon indicated.<\/p><p> Consultations are also ongoing on the area of hate speech.  There are issues around that and the characteristics of certain groups that have been defined.  Some argue that the bar is very high under the existing incitement to hatred legislation.  The definition of \"hatred\" in that legislation stipulates that an intention or likelihood to stir up hatred must be demonstrated.  We are also considering whether such laws adequately deal with online content.  Those issues are being developed.<\/p><p> This week, the Government announced the initiation of legislation to deal with political advertising, which will define political advertising, require its clear identification and labelling, and require the disclosure of any targeting or engagement metrics being used.  There is quite a bit of legislative initiative under development.  We also need to educate people and equip them with the right tools to help them be discerning in their use of the Internet.  That balance is very strong.<\/p><p> There is no doubt that the power of the Internet is accelerating.  When I was Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, we discussed aspects such as social, mobile, the cloud, and big data.  It has now moved on to the Internet of things and AI.  Principles of operation will be embedded within those areas, which should be subject to regulation.  This is a very tricky area for governments and it is absolutely essential that we work together across countries.  Media and politics are at the front line of this invasiveness, but it will start to move into other areas of our lives.  We need to decide the principles underpinning the roles of artificial intelligence, big data, micro targeting and so on.  This is a challenging area and this initiative is worthwhile in bringing countries together to be a part of this group.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22019110700002#Y00300","speaker":"1293","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1573084800,"counter":1629,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.

This mechanism should enable users' awareness of the type of content to which they have been exposed.  Consumer empowerment is part of the fourth pillar of the code, which is now being implemented.  Priority was given to other parts of the code during the first months of this year as they related more directly to the integrity of the elections.  Those include the fight against bots and fake accounts and other malicious or co-ordinated actions.  For the first time, a transparency space will be created for political ads where the question is not the veracity of the ads.  The question is who is paying for them, how much they are paying, and what the targeting criteria are.

A good friend of mine, the former European Data Protection Supervisor, Giovanni Buttarelli, who recently passed away, addressed the issue of election integrity last spring.  He made a very important point.  He said that, in his view, transparency and content management will not be sufficient to solve this problem.  This is about the collection and use of personal data.  If our aim is to safeguard the integrity of elections and to limit fake news, we must enforce these privacy obligations.  Transparency will not be a substitute for doing so.

Facebook quite brazenly claimed it was unnecessary for Internet companies to be bound by the same obligations that apply to print and broadcast media.  It removed itself from what traditional journalists and news organisations were required to do.  I believe this accelerated the trend towards fake news and disinformation.  My view at this point is that the time has long since passed for Facebook to come before this committee to say what type of regulation it thinks it will find acceptable.  There is enough reason now to say this is one place where we no longer need political advertising, which is a source of significant revenue.

This moment will come very soon, early next year.  My view is that today we are in a better place than we were a year ago.  It is clear that much more needs to be done as well.  There are several areas we may need to consider.  I will not mention them all.  As we are focusing in today's debate on political advertising, I remind the committee that the devil lies in the details.  I refer, for example, to the definition of \"political advertising\".  What would the ban be about?  What about sponsored content that communicates on social, political and economic issues that do not come within electoral contests and, therefore, escape the definition?  We are well aware that such content can influence and shape public opinion artificially and in a much more pernicious way in the long term.

The GDPR is not set up to tackle business models <i>per se<\/i>but to apply principles to data processing operations.  When we come to look at something like advertising technology or online behavioural advertising, there is, therefore, a complexity in that we have to target multiple actors.

It is when we first click on a website that the tracking technologies such as pixels, cookies and social plug-ins start the data collection that ultimately ends up categorising us for the purposes of sponsored stories or ad serving.  We are looking at the advertisement exchanges, the real-time bidding system, the front-end publishers and the advertisement brokers that play an important part in all of this in combining offline and online sources of data.

One point I would like to stress is that micro targeting is only one of the possible vulnerabilities of the ecosystem.  When we talk about disinformation, clickbait, which works by directing traffic into a malicious website, operates in a different way.  Micro targeting is typical for sponsored content and that is certainly an issue that needs to be addressed.  Then there are other issues that are not necessarily data-driven or are not so linked to the use of personal data.  For instance, the manipulation of media for amplification purposes where bot accounts behave in a co-ordinated manner and the trade of engagement indices or signals in the black market are not necessarily linked to the manipulation of personal data.  Another issue about personal data may appear in the area of algorithmic bias.  When the recommendation system operates in order to provide the user with certain recommendations, there we have an issue again with the usage of personal data.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22019110700002#CC00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paolo Cesarini"},{"type":"speech","time":1573084800,"counter":1668,"content":"<p>I will be as succinct as possible.

One of the findings of the committee in its discussions today and in some of the preliminary discussions yesterday has been that we should not delay because, as Mr. Rotenberg said, delay only suits the platforms.  There is an urgency about all of this.  Our Canadian colleagues told us yesterday that we must not let the perfect be the enemy of the good but must plough on and take steps.  That point was well made.  We may not take the final step but we must take the first steps and every step forward is progress.  In that vein, on the proposals the Minister mentioned, two Private Members' Bills that deal with these matters are before the committee.  These are the Digital Safety Commissioner Bill 2017 and the Online Advertising and Social Media (Transparency) Bill 2017, which I proposed.  Both of these Bills have undergone detailed scrutiny on First and Second Stage in the D&aacute;il.

First, the GDPR is not a set of principles but a set of rights and responsibilities associated with the collection and use of personal data.  When companies choose to collect personal data, they should be held to account.  Second, the decision in the Schrems case of 2015 makes clear that while co-ordinated enforcement anticipated under the GDPR is important, individual data protection authorities, DPAs, have their own authority to enforce the provisions of the charter, which means individual DPAs do not need to wait for a co-ordinated response to bring an enforcement action.<\/p><p>My final point is a matter of law.

I should say that in that context, even if 140 sounds like a relatively modest number, we are among the top tier of highly resourced data protection authorities both in the EU and globally.<\/p> <p>  I agree with the statement.  We do not have enough and that is why we sought more.  We see the scale of the challenge more clearly than anybody else can see it in terms of what we face.  All of these hard enforcement cases we are trying to drive in the investigations we have open are extremely labour-intensive in terms of the process we must follow.  I mentioned that we are being challenged and questioned at every turn.  We need more resources and this must see continued investment as an area of regulation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22019110700002#DD00700","nonspeaker":"Ms Helen Dixon"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1573084800,"counter":1681,"content":"<p>I can typify this as a tension between jobs and democracy and my concern is that democracy is in danger all the time of losing out to the jobs argument.

As for, artificial intelligence, I read a book by Mr. Jamie Susskind, a US writer who has written about the processes embedded in artificial intelligence that will determine things like our right to get insurance and jobs.  The political and governance system, in Ireland and internationally, has not yet caught up with this and struck a balance between freedom of expression and regulation.  These are complex issues.  The problem is not a lack of willingness to find solutions.  I have found that even the narrow aspect I am trying to deal with, the definition of harmful content, is quite tricky to regulate in a way that balances freedom of expression with the need to protect citizens, particularly vulnerable citizens, from its abuse.  It is not as simple as governments not bringing resources to bear.  These are genuinely tricky issues.  We need international co-operation in the design of a robust and enforceable response.  While it is important to ask whether sufficient resources are being devoted to the enforcement of existing legislation, many of these challenges are far more profound than that.

Eighteen months is not a long time and not all of the investigations have been open for 18 months.  We must follow due process or we will not secure the outcome in the end.  As these companies have market power and have the resources to litigate forever, we have to make sure we follow due process and allow them a right to be heard.

I would like to use my time to share with the committee some of the challenges that we see from the perspective of our organisation for parliaments being mobilised around the topic that is under discussion today and some of the opportunities.<\/p> <p>  For those who are unfamiliar with the Inter-Parliamentary Union, it is the world organisation of national parliaments.  There are 179 parliaments in the world that are members of the organisation.  With the exception of one, all of the parliaments that are represented here are members of the organisation.  As an international organisation we are grappling with this question.  In terms of challenges, we see that parliamentarians are not well equipped to deal with it effectively.  I am speaking from purely from a global perspective.  They have a lack of understanding of the technical issues that are at stake.<\/p><p>They are also finding it very difficult to situate the debate between what needs to be done at the national level and what is happening at the international level.  In addition, as was said earlier, there is a lack of clarity for them as to the governance structure which is dealing with this question at international level.  There is also a challenge for them in getting access to the right information.  What I really appreciate is seeing a variety of Members of Parliament represented here in the room.  That said, they are obviously from advanced countries so they have some similarities when it comes to their own national context.  Maybe also, because they are from advanced countries, they can more easily access representatives of tech companies because I would doubt if high-level representatives of the major tech companies would come before national parliaments far away from the West.<\/p><p> There is also the reality that we see in our discussions at the IPU about differences - legal differences and philosophical differences - around some of these major questions between countries but also between continents.  Even today, obviously we have two sides of the pond being represented.  Also, I guess there are fundamental differences between how freedom of expression is seen and what the limits are.  We all know that hate speech is not necessarily criminalised in the United States.  In addition, there are issues with regard to the financing of political campaigns.  In the United States, spending is pitched whereas, in Europe, the tradition is more one of using public funds to finance public campaigns.<\/p><p> We come from different realities and this is just the western world.  So what we are also facing in our discussions within the organisation is that there is a real variety of organisations and bringing everyone together is very difficult.  Where do we find common ground?  In trying to adopt a shared vision both of the problems but also the solutions.<\/p><p> We have seen that there is a growing sense, which was stated in the course of this morning, is that the business model is the real heart of the problem and that is something that needs to be tackled.  Now, also within the IPU, there is discussion around that.  I really like the statement that was made this morning around human rights and personal data.  Of course, if we could reset the clock and start again things could possibly look differently now.  Is that realistic?  Short of a radical reform, there is discussion within the organisation to push for increased transparency of the work of the tech companies, particularly when it comes to the algorithm amplification and political ads.  There is also a lot of debate on making a distinction between illegal versus harmful content.  Also, to see the issue as something slightly larger than misinformation and see it really as something that concerns society, as a whole, in the sense that we are faced by what has been termed \"junk news\" rather than fake news, which requires us all to move and come together to promote better civic education, to help promote civil discourse and help the people, at large, to be better able to recognise fake news.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22019110700002#KK00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Rogier Huizenga","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1573084800,"counter":1707,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman and her committee for the opportunity to present the Worldwide Web Foundation's views on this topic.  The foundation is a non-profit organisation founded by the inventor of the world wide web, Sir Tim Berners-Lee, to promote and defend the web as a basic right and public good for everyone.  We work to achieve this mission by securing policy change based on evidence and robust research.  Crucially, to a point that the previous speaker, Mr. Huizenga, has just made, we work equally and are equally active in developing countries as we are in the countries represented by the Parliaments here.<\/p> <p>  I guess the committee has heard a lot of important things today, many of which I would agree with, but I would like to make one further, very specific, proposal for the members of the committee and that is as follows.  We believe that a crucial step for lawmakers like yourselves is to require companies to publish regular human rights impact assessments and transparency reports.  That means companies will be expected to tell us how they have weighed the impact of their policies and products on individual human rights, and on our societies.  These reports should be grounded in international human rights frameworks and focus on disinformation and misinformation, hate speech, electoral interference and political ads.  These kinds of assessments have been more and more prevalent in other sectors such as extractives, manufacturing and agriculture but less so in technology.  Although some tech companies have started to publish transparency reports but we think they can go further.  The more we learn about how companies make these decisions then the more informed and empowered governments will be to regulate effectively in this area.<\/p> <p>  Before I go back to a little more detail on that, I will step back for a moment.  When Sir Tim Berners-Lee invented the world wide web in 1989 - 30 years ago - he changed the world.  He expanded our access to knowledge and freedom of expression more than arguably any other development in modern times.  In recent years, and as today's conversation has shown, we have seen the web misused to spread lies and hatred, and sow division within our communities.  It is a complex dynamic and tackling it, we think, will require an equally complex set of policies and, crucially, long-term thinking.<\/p> <p>  As public representatives, you are faced with a difficult balancing act: the need to respond swiftly to the harms caused to your constituents by disinformation, with the responsibility to uphold people's human rights and freedom of expression and avoid triggering unintended harms.  There are numerous challenges in the context of international co-operation on disinformation, and a number of them have been mentioned already.  Like the web itself, the platforms where much of the disinformation is spread operate globally but national laws vary and sometimes diverge.  Platforms struggle to fact-check content consistently at a global scale.  While platforms are making decisions that impact billions of lives globally, we have not had real insight into how those decisions are made.<\/p> <p>  Despite all of this, our sense - and certainly Sir Tim Berners-Lee's sense - is that there is hope.  Sir Tim Berners-Lee would maintain, in spite of it all, a determined optimism that there are ways we can come together now and in the future to address these challenges.  Last year, Sir Tim announced the creation of the contract for the web.  It is a social contract that would bring together governments, companies and civil society to agree on a set of ground rules to guide digital policy agendas.  More than 350 organisations have been part of the process so far.  The initiative began with a set of nine principles small enough to fit on a postcard.  In the next few weeks we will announce the full contract for the web with 76 clauses that emanate from the nine principles.  It is intended that this contract, which we will launch at the Internet Governance Forum in Berlin, can play its part as a broad plan to protect and secure the web as a public good.<\/p> <p>  In that context I shall return to that one specific proposal, which, in our view, sits very much at the heart of the contract for the web.  I refer to the increased commitment to transparency around risk assessments by companies.  While transparency is not, and should not be, the end of the road, it is an essential first step that supports evidence-based regulation and enforcement but it is that necessary first step.  So we call on companies to publish regular transparency reports that tell us how they have weighed the impact of their policies and products on human rights when it comes to misinformation and disinformation.  We also call on national parliaments around the world to take this first step by requiring platforms to take that step of their own.  I am happy to discuss this matter more as we get into questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22019110700002#LL00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Adrian Lovett"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1573084800,"counter":1708,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman and members for the opportunity to speak here today.<\/p> <p>  We are in the midst of a wicked problem and are running out of time.  A wicked problem is, by its very definition, something that is difficult or almost impossible to solve because of incomplete, contradictory and ever-changing requirements.  It cannot be solved through one solution alone.  Our wicked problem is an information disorder and that disorder is a symptom of a much wider societal problem - a collapse of trust in institutions, including media.<\/p> <p>  I have worked as a traditional journalist with Ireland's main newspapers, with Storyful, the world's first social media news agency, and with Facebook, the world's largest social media platform.  I launched a new start-up called Kinzen, the purpose of which is to reconnect people with quality news and information.  Throughout 16 years in the industry, I have remained very resolute about the importance of journalism to better help people to understand the world around them but also ever concerned about the phenomenon of more and faster content everywhere.  I have seen a new information ecosystem emerge in which everyone became a publisher, the means of consumption changed and the modes of distributing news became fragmented.<\/p><p>There were positives, of course.  We have largely become more connected, engaged and educated because of the Internet.  However, amid that period of massive disruption and digital transformation wherein online experiences were built for speed, clicks and scale, the connection between people and journalism was lost.<\/p><p> We are at another crossroads now and there is an opportunity for correction.  While the task list is long and complicated, there are three core areas in which to make a start: to ensure that we connect people with quality news and information; to build collaborative projects across multiple sectors so there are shared learnings; and to find thoughtful and pragmatic ways to hold technology companies accountable.<\/p><p> What does that mean in reality?  I believe that today&rsquo;s recommendation systems are a root cause of information disorder.  We need radical transparency on the programming of algorithms.  A new generation is seeking alternatives to the toxic noise, hidden surveillance and the endless distraction of their social feeds.  They demand an experience of information that rewards their best intentions, fits their daily routine and protects their privacy.  That means, we as an industry, need to build radically different news experiences.  In Kinzen, for example, we are building a citizen algorithm, in which data science and machine learning is guided by human curation and explicit user feedback of every single individual person.<\/p><p> We also require collaboration at an unprecedented scale across multiple industries.  In journalism, we need to find more opportunities for newsrooms to collaborate and not compete.  That means funding projects like the CrossCheck initiatives undertaken by the news organisation, First Draft, in places like Brazil and France where journalists from competitive organisations worked to find, debunk and report on different rumours during election cycles.  In digital literacy, we need long-term joined-up education initiatives, rather than one-off campaigns, when it comes to giving people - young and old - the skills and tools for consuming information online.  That means taking successful models like the Finnish Newspapers Association's work in schools for the past 50 years or the news literacy project curriculum in the United States, and using schools and libraries as the key gateways to build global media and information literacy, MIL, playbooks.<\/p><p> In research, we need to find more opportunities for academia to study anonymised data from technology companies so they can better understand what is working and not working.  That means scaling efforts like Social Science One - the non-profit commission launched in 2018 - to establish concrete partnerships between academics and data-rich institutions.  It now has 32 million individual links extracted from Facebook upon which to conduct research.<\/p><p> To be truly collaborative, we need to bring together civil society, technology companies, publishers, academics and governments so we can answer the question: what can we do together to tackle this wicked problem, while protecting freedom of speech?<\/p><p> Regulating the Internet is complex.

Clearly there is no need to stress that this is a transnational issue: that the committee has come together to discuss this issue speaks for itself.  The initiation of the Grand International Committee is also a sign that the existing institutions and processes are not adequate to deal with these issues.<\/p> <p>  Most online interactions and data flows today involve multiple jurisdictions based on the locations of users, servers, Internet platforms or technical operators.  Current frameworks for interstate legal co-operation struggle to handle this new digital reality.  In many cases they hinder or even prevent co-operation.  In some cases, they empower those who want to do harm or commit crimes.<\/p> <p>  How do we address issues such as the interoperability between the different norms; the interplay and the hierarchy between companies&rsquo; terms of service, national legislation, international treaties and commitments?  Who sets the standards?  What are geographically proportionate and relevant responses to these issues?  How do we ensure the rule of law and transparency of all these processes?<\/p> <p>  How do we effectively co-operate to ensure that those who commit crimes and inflame hatred or violence are prosecuted?  What is an appropriate punishment and what is the recourse for the victims?  We need institutions for all these things because the most common forms of punishment and redress seem to be take-down of problematic social media posts or accounts.<\/p> <p>  In order to come up with workable answers, we need new international tools and institutions for Internet governance.  This is one of the greatest challenges of the 21st century that no one can solve unilaterally.  In the absence of policy standards and appropriate frameworks, we face increasing tensions that trigger unco-ordinated short-term solutions.  National laws are enacted to try to deal with transnational problems, resulting in a legal arms race that risks unintended and harmful consequences, including jurisdictional conflicts and unwanted fragmentation of the Internet.<\/p> <p>  The organisation I work for, the Internet &amp;amp; Jurisdiction Policy Network, is about to publish the first ever report on the status of global Internet governance which shows that globally there are more than 300 such laws or Acts.  As the majority of them are not co-ordinated we risk fragmenting the Internet.<\/p> <p>  We need solutions that will bring values and rules-based international order to the Internet, while at the same time ensuring that our democratic institutions and all our fundamental human rights are fully respected.  This is a colossal task and shows why Internet governance must be a multi-stakeholder process.  In reality it is not because in most cases when we discuss inter-governance it ends up being an intergovernmental process.  In a true multi-stakeholder process all three branches of the state need to work with the fourth estate, the media, along with civil society groups, academia and the companies.  This is what the Internet &amp;amp; Jurisdiction Policy Network does as a multi-stakeholder Internet governance process.  We bring together approximately 300 key stakeholders from governments, Internet companies, technical operators, civil society groups, academia and international organisations from more than 50 countries to work together to develop policy standards and operational solutions.<\/p> <p>  In recent months our contact groups, working in three separate jurisdiction programs on data, content and domains, produced a series of proposals norms, procedures and mechanisms that we call operational approaches and I would be happy to share them with the committee.  The next focus for us will be on standards for recourse mechanisms, looking at issues of normative interoperability and transparency.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the committee's work I would like to highlight transparency, a matter mentioned by a number of people today, as one of the most useful tools in tackling disinformation.  I am referring to establishing standards and mechanisms to deal with the abuse of platforms and technical infrastructure for political, financial or other gains.<\/p> <p>  Members of the committee know the challenges of regulating speech.  The most problematic content does not fall neatly into what could be restricted under international human rights standards on freedom of expression.  These issues are constantly evolving and changing, and artificial intelligence only contributes to the speed and complexity of the problems to be solved.<\/p> <p>  I call on the members of committee, as representatives of the people, to support a multi-stakeholder, transnational Internet governance process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22019110700002#MM00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Frane Maroevic"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1573084800,"counter":1711,"content":"<p>I am grateful for the invitation to give evidence to the committee.  A way forward is to try to identify a model which is common - perhaps not a model law, but an underlying model that can then be deployed around the world in different jurisdictions.<\/p> <p>  The difficulty that is often raised with regard to content regulation is the subjectivity of content and the fact that standards differ from state to state.  To address this problem, I would suggest a regulatory system that looks at the underlying systems, one that moves the focus from the content to the mechanisms that encourage content, facilitate its sharing and distribution, and select the content that comes to people's attention.<\/p><p>It is my contention that the platforms have developed with a disregard for the impact on the sorts of content and the sort of content that is prioritised and widely shared.  This goes back to the discussion about the business model, which is about encouraging user engagement with the aim of getting more data, which is then used as a commodity.  The principle put forward by Carnegie United Kingdom Trust is that there should be a statutory duty of care as regards the systems.  It is starting with an assessment of risk; identifying the consequences, be they intended or unintended; and, crucially, taking steps to mitigate.  Rather than leaving it at transparency, it involves asking why something has been deployed and how it can be made better.  <\/p><p> When Google first started, it said that it viewed data as an exhaust product of the search engine business.  I now wonder whether we have reached the point where people's content is the exhaust product of the data collection business and that we should be moving to try to get a cleaner engine rather than a dirty diesel one.  That is what the Carnegie project is about.  I am happy to share further detail.  We have done quite a bit of work on this but I do not want to weigh discussions down.  I would suggest that using a model that focuses on systems is beneficial in an international context because one does not have the difficulty of agreeing about difficult content.  What one is looking at isn on the whole, further up the process and it is possibly easier to find common ground there so one can then be in a position of deploying a common model that can be responded to within an individual state context.  I would emphasise that this can never be a silver bullet.  There will probably always be a role for moderation for take-down and in some instances, possible law enforcement engagement but this sits on top of this common model.  It is when one starts looking at particular items of content that the difficulty and differences arise.  That is the proposal.  It involves a statutory duty of care aimed at the systems - the infrastructure itself.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22019110700002#MM00300","nonspeaker":"Professor Lorna Woods","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1573084800,"counter":1713,"content":"<p>I thank Professor Woods.

Our view is that what has been taken forward in Germany is not a model to follow so there is a lot of work to be done there.  The committee is at the front line of trying to figure this out - what it looks like at a national level.  I agree with Professor Woods that for us, a focus on the process is as, or possibly more, important as a focus on the end content.  Our hope is that the idea about transparency reports and human rights assessments will expose not just the numbers of take-downs and so on, which we are starting to see more of, but the basis for decisions.

It involves whether one can work with the public, civil society and a coalition of organisations to build standards that are about behaviour and, in parallel with that, the technology platforms would build covenants - that these are their warranties - so that they are held responsible as well to ensure there is platform responsibility matched to those standards.<\/p><p>Layered on top of that could be independent regulators tracking and monitoring the implementation of the standards and covenants and, ultimately, imposing huge fines where there has been a stepping out of line.

The way we look at it, the disinformation and misinformation have three parts.  First, there is deliberate, malicious intent, whether it is state-sponsored or otherwise.  That was talked about today.  I refer to intent to bring about an income systematically and in a very determined way.  There is system design that creates perverse incentives and rewards.  The teenagers in Macedonia churning out factually incorrect stories about Hillary Clinton's health, for example, did not in most cases have a political axe to grind.  They figured out how to make a few euro.  That was a result of the incentives created by the system.  Then there are the unintended negative consequences of design, which also come with what we might argue are positives associated with the more open discourse we are now able to have online.

There was some research done on the recent Indian election and the role of WhatsApp.  Some of it was suggesting that the intimacy of a WhatsApp group has an impact on people's tendency to believe.  A question arises, therefore, about the design of groups.  Are they really small groups of friends or are they just conglomerations of relative strangers?

We need to accelerate our AI machine-learning efforts ultimately to be preventive and remove bad actors who are trying to spew confusion.  There is a human layer on top, whether it is through the fact-checkers and efforts like First Draft, which I mentioned, whereby one is ultimately accelerating the efforts of the fact-checkers but ensuring the fact check travels back to those who might have viewed something false.  A problem with many of the fact-checking efforts mentioned earlier is that they often occur long after the viral peak window.  We are not capturing the people in the first 12 hours when there is peak virality.  Therefore, we need to build systems and technology that identifies and goes back to the people and asks them whether they have seen a certain other perspective, which is from a trustworthy source.

On the question of us and whose army, approximately 350 organisations signed up in support of the principles and committed to engaging with the process of turning them into concrete actions.  The 350 organisations include most or all of the major platforms, a number of governments, including the German Government and the French Government, and some terrific civil society organisations in the global south and elsewhere.

Tim Berners-Lee has always had a strong sense that while Facebook and Google are not the web, there is an opportunity which perhaps is unrealised for those players and others to help to strengthen and build the web and, within the wider Internet, to reinforce the values of the web, including transparency and openness, to have a permissionless space and enable people to have the opportunity to be creators, as well as consumers.  While we are, first and foremost, concerned about the worldwide web that Tim Berners-Lee invented, we are also determined to see how much of the spirit, value and ethics behind it can be experienced.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22019110700002#PP00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Adrian Lovett"},{"type":"speech","time":1573084800,"counter":1738,"content":"<p>I have a question for Ms Kerr.  It is a sad day for Irish media, with job losses having been announced at the national public broadcaster.  I thought her contribution was very important as we have been thinking about the business model.  Is it data harvesting to fund advertising or is it a paid subscription model?  That is not, however, the whole picture because, as Ms Kerr says, everyone has to be able to connect to quality journalism.  As some people will not be able to pay subscriptions, we need public service, high quality journalism that everyone can access.  What is ironic is that the current business model for social media makes it impossible to fund public service broadcasting in this country.  Does Ms Kerr have any specific proposal for the funding of public service broadcasting?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22019110700002#PP00600","speaker":"1294"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1573084800,"counter":1739,"content":"<p>The advertising model is broken for the journalism industry.  We need to think about devising radically diverse models for the funding of journalism.  The Deputy is right that, when it comes to public service journalism, we need to help to fund it.  In this country that includes rethinking the television licence fee.  As we all know, the mode by which we consume media has changed.  We are the Netflix and Spotify generation.  We need to think about taxes and subsidies that address this device by device mode of consumption.  <\/p> <p>  On the model itself, we have to think about a system wherein people will understand why journalism is important and make a donation or contribution or become a member.  That means that we will have to do a better job as an industry in amplifying the reasons.  With that comes a new form of journalism that will be people-powered.  It states less is more and that we are going to stop annoying people with irritating advertisements.  Instead of having a lot of content that keeps people scrolling endlessly on platforms, applications and websites, the new form of journalism should give people a productive experience.  That means giving them the right content and right format in the right amount of time that feels purposeful and productive.  Right now all of the evidence shows that people feel incredibly overwhelmed by the amount of content online.  They hide their digital footprints and turn off.  There is, however, an opportunity.  There are means for governments to ensure taxes incentivise and subsidise media.  Perhaps there could be a tax incentive to pay a subscription or become a member of a media organisation whereby they could claim back the fee when making their tax return each year.<\/p><p>It also comes to funding it from the ground up to ensure that local journalism can survive.  If we look across at the US desert, that is a phenomenon that increasingly, we will see across Europe.

What I find extraordinary, and we got this more of less right in the UK when I was growing up in the 1950s, is that an understanding of the subtleties and importance of public service broadcasting was entirely understood.  It got badly beaten during the Thatcher years, and reconstructing the understanding that existed generally - it was not an imposed but a societal understanding - is extremely difficult.

What I mean by that is that we are being tracked across the Internet.  What does it look like for a public service broadcaster and others to give power back to people, to give them control of their experiences and, by doing that, for them to feel that experience with journalism?  That is where the imperative is at in general for us, but it will take a level playing field and taxes and subsidies to ensure that from the ground up people understand that role.<\/p> <p>  That is why Lord Puttnam's media literacy question is important.  We have to ingrain this from the get-go for people to understand why the institution of media is important.

They will get more sophisticated about how they go about their business.

There has always been targeting in advertising and we have had that for centuries, but what is different now is the scale and speed at which that works and the opacity of it and the great difficulty we have in seeing the effect of it.  We should recognise it is not a simple question, because while there may well be a place in some form for political advertising, properly regulated and fully transparent, there is not enough confidence at the moment that the unseen is not doing great harm.

The power of the web was that sort of randomness, where it was built on meritocracy and random discovery.  That, in turn, drove content producers where indigenous content and citizen journalism could come about.  Ms Kerr has talked about that as well today.  That was the dream, the goal and the utopia of the web at the outset.  That has been choked back in two ways.  The net neutrality debate rages on.  The platform is layered on top of that and is equally filtering material out.  For some people Facebook, or Google to an extent, are the Internet.  In this context, and with a view to the platforms and the kind of regulation we are discussing today, how do we best manage that?  I do not know if we can turn back the clock, and maybe we do not want to completely turn the clock back, but there is a goal from the earlier days of the web that is worth preserving, which is the meritocracy model and that citizen journalism and openness to anyone to have their 15 minutes of fame on whatever channel it may be.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22019110700002#SS00500","speaker":"1323"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1573084800,"counter":1778,"content":"<p>We are still very focused on that fight for net neutrality, most particularly in the United States, where there was a great step forward, and now we are fighting to re-secure that several years on; we have not given up on that fight.<\/p> <p>  On the broader question, it is true that we cannot turn back the clock.  Tim Berners-Lee and others of those Internet pioneers would not want us to do that.  Channelling some of the inspiration and vision of those early days and applying it to the very different times we find ourselves in now, it may be time to think about a new connecting imperative.  Perhaps this might help.  I was talking a little while ago to one of the chief executive officers of one of the big airlines.  I was asking him what his focus was.  He was quite new in the job, six months in, and said obviously his was an airline company so the first priority is safety.  He went on to talk about the things I thought he was going to talk about around the brand, staff relations, and so on.  He got me thinking then about the aviation industry being a place where businesses make healthy profits and provide a service to customers but also where public safety is the first priority and where companies are required to co-operate with each other, as well as with regulators.  There is zero-tolerance of mistakes and a significant degree of transparency.  If we agree that the Internet can not only improve and enhance lives, upon which we all agree, but that it can also profoundly damage and -  it is not too much of an overstatement - can cost lives, then surely the evidence is that we could agree that for companies on the web, the universally-accepted imperative must be public safety.  That might be a new driver for how we organise all of this thinking for the next 30 years, quite different from the thinking that has prevailed for the past 30.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22019110700002#SS00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Adrian Lovett"},{"type":"speech","time":1573084800,"counter":1779,"content":"<p>I thank all of the witnesses.<\/p> <p>  We will suspend the meeting for our final session and we will resume at 4.30 p.m.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22019110700002#SS00700","speaker":"1315"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1573084800,"counter":1780,"content":"<p>Sitting suspended at 4.06 p.m. and resumed at 4.30 p.m.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Session 5: Future Collaboration","time":1573084800,"counter":1781,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22019110700002#VV00100"},{"type":"speech","time":1573084800,"counter":1782,"content":"<p>The fifth session of today's proceedings gives members an opportunity to discuss options for future collaboration.  I asked members in advance to think about which organisations or mechanisms they would consider appropriate for working together to advance a cohesive multilateral agenda of regulation.  This is our third international grand committee hearing.  We have had social media companies before us.  We often hear many of the same answers to our questions.  Today's meeting has been very productive.  We have heard expert views that have given us options for a path forward.  It is clear that no international rule-making body is dealing with this issue in a coherent way.  We need the rule of law to apply to social media when it comes to political interference, political advertising, online harm and fake news, but it is not there at the moment.<\/p> <p>  We will hold a press conference at 5.30 p.m.  I want to open the meeting up to members before then.  What is the overriding message that is coming forward?  From my own point of view, I think the issue of targeted political advertising on social media has been recurring throughout all the hearings today.  I will let those present think about our message for a moment.  Maybe we could consider recommending a moratorium on micro-targeted political advertising until regulation is in place.  I am not suggesting that there could not be political advertising online, but that the micro-targeted approach could be stalled temporarily.  This is something the members might want to discuss.  Perhaps we can all agree on this as an issue that could come out of today's deliberations.<\/p> <p>  There is another issue that I would like to open up to members.  We might consider the taxation of social media companies to support public service broadcasting.  There is real concern about journalism, factual information, factual news, combatting fake news and supporting public service media and public service broadcasting.  We are looking at ways to support that.  Are members in agreement on coming together on these issues before the press conference later this afternoon?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22019110700002#VV00200","speaker":"1315"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1573084800,"counter":1783,"content":"<p>It might be helpful if one thing could be clarified.

National parties can spend X amount; constituencies are restricted to &pound;15,000 each.<\/p><p>If those individual voters are micro targeted, it does not count as part of the &pound;15,000.

As the Chair says, there are myriad different possible points but none is immediately achievable.<\/p> <p>  To cite our experience in the referendum, which our Singaporean colleagues cited several times, this became an issue of concern and at the last minute the platforms withdrew from advertising because it was so contentious.  It would be very useful if we, as a group representing several parliaments, came out with the sort of moratorium the Chair talks of because it would not just leave it to the platforms to make the decision.  It would be one political voice in this space asking for that action to take place.  As Lord Puttnam says, this is a fairly immediate issue in the UK.  We have an election coming up in the spring and our Singaporean colleagues are on the same sort of timeline and the US presidential election is not very far away.  If we could get broad agreement on such a moratorium, it would be very beneficial and it would prevent what happened in our case, when it happened by default without any political contribution.

That gets around many of the issues we have been talking about.  It promotes transparency in the political advertising but also in terms of micro targeting and when it is and is not permissible.  It is always permissible if everybody else can see it.  It is the dark hands that are hidden away behind micro targeting to see one particular micro sector of which nobody else has visibility.  If there is transparency on it and disclosure behind that, and if we mandate that it must be available through a library or regular access, that takes away the dark web and dark advertising.

I am pleased to be here.  I refer members to the written version of my opening statement, which I have provided.  I will not necessarily read all of it, but I will go over the main points.  I will first contextualise the discussion and then consider the question of citizenship in the context of the voting rights issue we are reflecting on this afternoon.  I want to put this discussion in a wider context without losing sight of the specific issue concerning voting rights in presidential elections.<\/p> <p>  Any number of contexts could be mentioned, but I will focus on two.  One is Brexit and what is happening with that.  We have a withdrawal agreement and a protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland.  It is important to underline, in respect of the withdrawal agreement and protocol, that there are references there to human rights and equality protections, as well as matters such as the continuation of the common travel area.  My sense is that those aspects of the protocol have been rather neglected in public discussion thus far.  It is important to highlight that there is recognition in the much discussed protocol of commitments to rights and equality.<\/p> <p>  One issue concerning voting rights, which I raise in the written version of my statement, is that it is important to reflect on is what happens regarding the European Parliament once Northern Ireland and the UK leave the European Union.<\/p><p>There has been some discussion already, as members will be aware, as to how Northern Ireland's voice might be represented in the European Parliament in a post-Brexit context.  I wanted to highlight in my written paper what might be done by the Irish Government around voting rights but also questions around possible observer status to ensure a voice from Northern Ireland continues to be heard in the European Parliament after Brexit.  There has been quite a discussion about the democratic element of what will essentially be a special arrangement for Northern Ireland as reflected in the protocol.  That aspect of it has been rather neglected.  There has been much discussion of the mechanism around the Northern Ireland Assembly.<\/p><p> The second context is the implementation gap with respect to the Good Friday Agreement.  There is a question around the birthright provision of the Good Friday Agreement.  This concerns the right to be British, Irish or both and to identify and be accepted as such, along with the outworkings of the DeSouza case and where that is at.  What is emerging is that British law policy and practice really needs to change to fully reflect that commitment to the birthright guarantee.  What emerged from the Upper Tribunal decision is a sense that the Home Office and the British Government feel their interpretation of the agreement is the correct one and it is not an admission but deliberate.  That is concerning to all of us.  There is a widespread view, including that of the Government which the Taoiseach made clear, that it is a misreading of the agreement.  That needs to be addressed in the negotiations to come.<\/p><p> In the discussion around the birthright clause, we are talking about the rights of British citizens, Irish citizens and the right to be either or both.  What is worth underlining is that the Good Friday Agreement packaged that within a broader human rights framework.  That has been neglected.  For example, there is still no bill of rights for Northern Ireland flowing from the Good Friday Agreement.  There is no charter of rights for the island of Ireland as anticipated in the agreement.  In my written submission, I gave an example from the advice submitted by the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission in December 2008 in which it recommended a cultural and identity clause.  Way back in 2008, the commission had already recognised the problem that we are now facing into regarding domestic incorporation of those provisions.<\/p><p> We have really felt the absence of a comprehensive human rights framework as anticipated by the Good Friday Agreement in the North and on the island.  Brexit makes that conversation one that is urgently needed in terms of the protections people need now and into the future.  I really want to underline the need to revisit that discussion as part of the ongoing negotiations and conversations that are happening.<\/p><p> On issues such as parity of esteem and equal treatment, I refer members to the Irish language legislation and the failure to fulfil promises in that regard.  The presidential voting rights issue is its own specific question.  There is a rather troubling and worrying framework in which this conversation is taking place.  There is a sense in which the human rights promises of the Good Friday Agreement have not been taken forward in the way anticipated.  Commitments around mutual respect, parity of esteem and equality of treatment remain unfulfilled in law policy and practice.  The good news is that there are solutions to some of those problems.  The tricky bit is getting those solutions implemented in practice in the time ahead.<\/p><p> Citizenship and voting rights are relatively straightforward.  The Constitutional Convention in 2013 made clear recommendations on what should happen on that both for all Irish citizens and Irish citizens living in the North.  There was an options paper in 2017.  We now have the Bill, the Referendum Commission and perhaps a referendum happening at some point in the near future.  There is a growing international European trend towards the recognition of non-resident voting rights.  It is clear, as members know from the evidence that they have already seen, that Ireland's restrictive approach is a real outlier both on a European basis and internationally.  The right to vote is a fundamental civil and political right.  There is a strong citizens&rsquo; rights rationale for taking this forward and, increasingly, given international trends and international practice, of basing that right not on residency but on citizenship.  My own sense is that the blanket system which currently exists in Ireland cannot be justified.  Change is reasonable, proportionate and justified given international practice and given the fundamental importance of this foundational civil and political right.<\/p><p> The issue of people over territory is very much at the heart of the Good Friday Agreement.  Taking forward this initiative of presidential voting rights will have the advantage of beginning to tackle some of the barriers that separate us on this island and internationally, as well as overcoming mutual misunderstanding and mistrust.  In that context, it is important to bear in mind that the UK system permits overseas voting in certain contexts.<\/p><p> The Irish Constitution speaks to all citizens.  It talks about a shared island and speaks to the diaspora as part of a global conversation about citizenship and the Irish nation.  What is being proposed is, in our rather febrile times, reasonable, sensible, modest constitutional reform, dealing with a specific issue, presidential voting rights, which would bring Ireland into line with what is happening internationally.<\/p><p> In my written submission, I proposed several recommendations which I will share.  First, we need to revisit the sort of comprehensive human rights framework for Northern Ireland and for the island envisaged in the Good Friday Agreement.  That includes revisiting proposals from the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission on a bill of rights and proposals from the North-South joint committee for a charter of rights for the island.  Brexit makes that conversation essential.  We must keep in mind that the Conservative Party - who knows who the next British Government may be - has talked consistently about repealing the Human Rights Act and replacing it with the British Bill of Rights.  We need to revisit that discussion.  The birthright guarantee of the agreement matters not just for Irish citizens but British citizens as well.  It also matters not just now but in the future.<\/p><p>We should remember it is an obligation that will persist in the event of constitutional change.  British domestic law, policy and practice have to change to reflect that agreement provision.  As the Taoiseach has made clear, the current British position is a misreading of that clause.<\/p><p> We also need to give more thought than is currently being given to a representative voice for the North in the European Parliament post Brexit.  We need to have discussions on voting rights as well as possible observer status in the European Parliament to make sure not only that the Northern Ireland Assembly has a voice in the new arrangements but also that the voice of Northern Ireland is heard at the European Parliament going forward given the special status that will emerge.<\/p><p> I will end with a forceful point on voting rights in presidential elections.  We live in a world of myths and fake news and in rather febrile and difficult times.  Ultimately, having thought about this issue for a number of years and having spoken to the Constitutional Convention in 2013 and done quite a bit of work on it, my view, given what is happening internationally, is that this is a modest, reasonable change that relates specifically to the voting rights in presidential elections.  Others do this.  It is good to see the Government making progress on the issue and it would be useful to see a referendum on it as soon as possible.  Support for the principle of non-resident voting rights is growing and has gained widespread European and international support.  <\/p><p> What worries me about this discussion is the temptation to focus excessively on risks.  That neglects the opportunities and benefits of enhanced engagement with Irish citizens wherever they live on the island or globally.  Thus far, there has not been sufficient focus on the benefits to this island of enhanced engagement as part of work on promoting, in practical terms, the idea of global Ireland, having that level of engagement and ensuring people are fully engaged democratically with Irish society.  To make a simple point, having looked at the large number of states around the world which do this - members will have seen all the evidence on this and they do not need me to go over it - I have concluded that the Irish State has the local and global capacity to do this and make it work.  I thank the members for listening.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2019110700002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Professor Colin Harvey","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1573084800,"counter":1831,"content":"<p>I thank Professor Harvey for his presentation today.  It is great to see him again.  He always gives very clear and precise presentations.<\/p><p>I will make a few points and I ask Professor Harvey to comment on them and give his view.  Ireland is an outlier on this issue.  Of the 28 EU member states, 24 allow their citizens to vote from abroad, while only four, Malta, Cypress, Denmark and Ireland, do not.  Germany had previously set a 25-year time limit on external voting but this was relaxed in 2012.  The United Kingdom has a 15-year time limit but after a European Court of Human Rights, ECHR, case, it now plans to drop it.  Internationally, the trend is moving strongly towards providing for external voting rights, with more than 120 countries now having done so.  These figures emphasise how out of step we are on this issue.<\/p><p>On the legal aspect, in 2014 the European Commission Vice-President, Viviane Reding, was strongly critical on this matter, suggesting a potential legal challenge in the Court of Justice of the European Union.  She said:<\/p><blockquote>The right to vote is one of the fundamental political rights of citizenship.  Depriving citizens of their right to vote once they move to another EU country is effectively tantamount to punishing citizens for exercising their right to free movement.<\/blockquote> <p>In this manner, she added, &quot;suffrage becomes effectively suspended for the duration of the migration.&quot;  Does Professor Harvey agree that a legal challenge could be made on this matter?  Is the issue different for Irish citizens who were born and are living in the North given that they have not moved country?<\/p><p>Should seats in the European Parliament be sought solely for Irish citizens living in the North or should they be for Irish citizens living anywhere outside the State?  If the North leaves the European Union because of Brexit, is there a legal difference in terms of the right to vote between an Irish citizen living outside the State in Belfast and an Irish citizen living outside the State in Australia or the United States?  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2019110700002#D00300","speaker":"1408"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1573084800,"counter":1832,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Black for the questions.  I agree with much of what she said.  The evidence is crystal clear that Ireland is an outlier and is out of step.  As the Senator said, some very strong statements have been made about the position in Ireland, which needs to change.  My view is that the blanket nature of the Irish position leaves it vulnerable.  As many of the members will know, courts do not like near-blanket exclusions and so there is a vulnerability there.  As a matter of principle, being so out of step with European partners is in itself a rationale for addressing this issue now without the need for a future legal challenge.  There is an opportunity to address this.<\/p> <p>  A number of issues arise in relation to the European Parliament.  I will separate out two of them.  Given that the protocol envisages some form of potentially near-permanent arrangement for Northern Ireland going forward, the focus has been on the assembly and its role in this regard.  The witnesses will know what the arrangements are.  There has also been a discussion about making sure the voice of Northern Ireland is heard in the European Parliament going forward.  I will separate out how that issue might be addressed.  There are a number of suggestions around that, one of which includes the potential to provide for observer status to make sure it is addressed.<\/p> <p>  The second issue raises a wider point.  We are having a conversation today about presidential voting rights and whether residents outside the State should be able to vote in those specific elections.  Obviously, there is a bigger conversation to be had about voting rights in other elections.  My own sense is that those conversations are for another day because we have reached a point in the discussion where there is a Bill with concrete proposals that are specific to presidential voting rights.  It is important to keep the focus of the conversation on that.  However, this raises a question in the longer term about other elections.  As members will know much better than I do, in a context where there is often an appetite to take one issue and magnify it into 45 issues, it is important to note that this is about voting for the fundamentally important and symbolic role of the Irish President and extending voting rights for that particular election.  The wider conversation needs to be had and is being had already.  However, as we are facing into a referendum on this particular issue, perhaps it is one for another day.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2019110700002#D00400","nonspeaker":"Professor Colin Harvey"},{"type":"speech","time":1573084800,"counter":1833,"content":"<p>I will focus first on voting rights in presidential elections and then move on to citizens' rights.  Very few people have a difficulty with extending voting rights in presidential elections to everyone on this island.<\/p><p>Professor Harvey mentioned avoiding the risks.  I would like to dwell on that for a second.  The issue that concerns many people is the possibility of personality politics.  We saw this to some degree in the previous presidential election.  Has Professor Harvey looked at how people would qualify under the Bill he is discussing?  I am not overly familiar with it.  In tandem with this reform, would it make sense to reduce the voting age from 18 to 16 right across the island to give the opportunity to vote to people who obviously want their say?  Professor Harvey might say this would confuse the issue.  Does he have a view on show business personalities who run for a position for symbolic or other reasons but do not necessarily qualify for the role of President?<\/p><p> The issue of citizens' rights and birthrights under the Good Friday Agreement has been raised.  The T&aacute;naiste committed in this forum to addressing the presidential vote in October of this year.  It has not materialised so it must have been put on the back burner.  We challenged Robin Walker MP on citizens' rights at the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly.  He was at pains to point out that the agreement does not just offer the right to be British or Irish and emphasised the right to be neither.  I thought this was interesting because it is not referred to in the Good Friday Agreement.  It has been 20 years since the Good Friday Agreement was signed.  Research carried out here in Leinster House makes clear that rights were amended last March to deal with migrants in Britain.  As Professor Harvey says, the British Government has flagrantly decided on a different interpretation of the agreement.  The T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Coveney, and the D&aacute;il have committed to changing this.  Why was it not considered before?  In Professor Harvey's view, why has it taken almost 20 years for the need to enshrine this in legislation to reach our agendas?  Very few people seem to have spoken about it until recently.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2019110700002#D00500","speaker":"1332","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1573084800,"counter":1835,"content":"<p>First, I would like to keep the focus on the specific issue we are talking about with this Bill, that is, presidential voting rights and extending the franchise.  However, we are essentially talking about inclusion.  There are proposals to move to a more inclusive system that embraces all citizens on a generous basis.  As such, extending the franchise where age is concerned is a highly topical issue.  Allowing people below the age of 18 to contribute to that conversation would be in the spirit of inclusion.  Looking back, there have been siren songs about the implications of taking every step on the journey towards making the franchise more inclusive.  We are talking about broadening the scope of the franchise in presidential elections.  I am strongly in favour of examining voting age.  Although the focus today is primarily on residency, age restrictions are also very much a live issue.<\/p> <p>  Brexit has been a major contributor to an enhanced focus on citizenship rights and identity in the past three years.  The advice of the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission in 2008, nearly 11 years ago, had already identified that this was missing from domestic law, policy and practice in Britain.  There were voices pointing out that some core provisions of the agreement concerning parity of esteem, mutual respect and equal treatment were not fully and faithfully reflected in domestic law, policy and practice.  Recent events have underlined that.  It takes courageous individuals making a stand and bringing an issue to public attention, with all the difficulties that involves, to ensure that what is known in a smaller circle becomes more widely known.  Then we can think about how that can be changed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2019110700002#E00200","nonspeaker":"Professor Colin Harvey"},{"type":"speech","time":1573084800,"counter":1836,"content":"<p>I thank Professor Harvey for his presentation.  I commend him on his report, The EU and Irish Unity - Planning and Preparing for Constitutional Change in Ireland.  There has been some commentary around Queen's University.  I would like reassurance from the Professor that all the ethical guidelines and frameworks were followed in the preparation of this report.  It is very important to have reports like this, no more than reports addressing the merits of the union.  That is what creates the conversation, and taking a proper academic and evidence-based approach to these conversations can only add to their richness.  Will Professor Harvey comment on that, if he is free to do so?<\/p> <p>  Who is responsible for the bill of rights not being implemented?  Is it solely within the gift of the British Government and domestic law to do that or is there a responsibility on the Irish Government as co-guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement?  The tangible outcome of failure to address these things and fully implement all of the agreements was exposed in Ms Emma DeSouza's case.  My other question concerns identity and the right to choose.  Apart from the Emma DeSouza case, are there other ways to highlight the lack of those rights to hold a British or Irish identity or both?<\/p> <p>  Regarding presidential voting rights, I commend the work done by Votes for Irish Citizens Abroad, VICA, in Britain and our own colleague, Senator Lawless, who has also worked hard on this issue.  It is astounding that there seems to be cross-party agreement.  I have never met anybody who was against offering voting rights based on citizenship rather than residency.  Perhaps I will ask Professor Harvey if he has.  I certainly do not think it is anything to be feared.  As somebody who lived outside of the country for a long time, I would certainly have appreciated the right to vote in presidential elections.  If everyone is in agreement on it, what are the barriers to it actually happening?  All of the costings have been done, so it is not an issue of cost.  It is not a matter of disagreement between parties or anything else.  Why is it being stopped, and what more can we do to make that referendum happen?

This year, I have been researching the question of the constitutional future of the island.  As a result, I have received feedback and constructive criticism but have also attracted quite a bit of tension in the public domain.  I am sure members are all very aware of that as they get it themselves.  I made a decision last week at an event I attended to simply mention out loud that I felt under siege in my institution as a result of doing that work.  I do not want to in any way overplay or exaggerate that because I simply want to get on with doing the work.  I recently worked on a rather tedious 80 page report, a rather boring one as is common with academics, with footnotes on which I would welcome feedback and comment.  My view, and I may be wrong, is that in the current context, the responsible thing for academics and others to do is talk, plan and prepare for wherever we might be going on this island and these islands so I plan to continue to make a contribution to that.  I would issue an invitation to everyone and anyone to speak with me.  I am happy to engage with anyone on or beyond the island about the issues on which I have been working.<\/p> <p>  The absence of a bill of rights for Northern Ireland is a tragedy because we desperately need a comprehensive framework of human rights protection.  Yes, we have the Human Rights Act but we do not have that comprehensive framework - that constitutionalised framework - that the agreement anticipated.  There are proposals there.  Why do I use the word \"tragedy\"?  I use it because I think it would have helped.  I am not saying it would have solved all our problems but it would have helped with regard to some of the challenges we face.  Let me be clear about that.  The advice was submitted to the Secretary of State in December 2008.  The response from the British Government was rather dismissive.  I speak as a member of the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission at that time who was involved in the process.  I simply think it is worth revisiting that work.  I have given the committee an example from the advice.  Can anybody tell me that this clause in that document from 2008 would not be helpful right now with regard to some of the things with which we are grappling?  We could do with revisiting that.  <\/p> <p>  It connects to the other question about the Emma DeSouza case.  I do not want to simply list all sorts of things that have not been done but there is an issue relating to legislating for parity of esteem, mutual respect and equality of treatment in respect of the North.  It has not been satisfactorily done.  The case of Emma DeSouza highlights one part of that.  The debate around an Irish language Act is increasingly part of that bigger conversation regarding not adequately reflecting the letter and spirit of the agreement in domestic law, policy and practice.  It is a bit like the document mentioned earlier.  The society in which I live is often caricatured in all sorts of ways.  To be fair to us all, there are a lot of solutions on the table in terms of how some of the problems we identify can be addressed.  The committee will note that I have also indicated the potential solution to many of the things I spoke about today, where the solution might be found and how it might be addressed.  We face a real implementation problem that is addressed in respect of a number of issues but needs to be addressed in respect of other issues as well.  <\/p> <p>  Does anyone disagree about presidential voting rights?  What I sense about it is that one often hears an anxiety about a number of things.  Members will have heard this as well.  People are worried about the impact of people who are not resident voting on the outcome of elections, the administration of it logistically and how it will work.  I took part in a radio programme this morning where the interviewer twice mentioned the issue of taxation and contribution so there are those anxieties, worries and fears about it that members will have heard, as I have.  In respect of where we are at the moment and dealing with these things in the way we have through the Constitutional Convention in 2013 and talking them through with elected representatives and members of the public - working up options and proposals and steadily, calmly and reasonably working through some of those fears and anxieties - citizens' rights are fundamental; we are an outlier globally on this but it can be done because other states manage this successfully.  There are people voting in presidential elections in other countries on this island and being facilitated to do so.  There is a sense in which, to borrow Michel Barnier's language, we need to make this rather boring and de-dramatise it.  It is a modest and sensible proposal that we have the capacity to implement.  <\/p> <p>  I will end with a slightly less academic contribution to this.  When we talk about the conversation on presidential voting rights, it is not an academic conversation for people like me.  I am an Irish citizen.  I was born in Derry, sold out and now live in Belfast, which is the worst thing someone can do.  This affects me personally.  I would like to vote for my president so it is not just an academic issue.  I would ask everybody in this room to think about our families - our brothers, sisters, mothers, fathers, aunts, uncles and cousins - and the people to whom we have had to say goodbye at ferry terminals and airports.  When I travel home on the train this evening, am I also waving goodbye to my basic civil and political rights?  There are statistics about the number of states that do this and the way they do it but at the heart of this is a very human story about people - our own families - and about including them.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2019110700002#F00300","nonspeaker":"Professor Colin Harvey"},{"type":"speech","time":1573084800,"counter":1840,"content":"<p>I thank Professor Harvey for his fascinating presentation.

To respond to the first, regarding the agreement, whatever happens in the time ahead, and we are in very challenging times, that is where we will all end up again.  When people use the language, which they do in the Brexit discussion, of the Good Friday Agreement \"in all its parts\", it means what it says: the Good Friday Agreement in all its institutional parts and in all the values reflected in the agreement.  These islands will end up back there because it is a sophisticated document that deals with the totality of relationships that will need to be repaired and rebuilt in the time ahead.  It remains unimplemented in many significant ways and is under strain, but what has been remarkable about the Brexit conversation is that although there have been some slightly interesting interpretations of the agreement, there seems to be universal endorsement of it and an agreement that we need to get back to it and back to making it work and that we can do so.  The committee knows that the North of this island has been through some challenging and tough times.  I think it is possible to make progress on that.<\/p> <p>  Academically, political points are being made about all this stuff but, in a very boring sense, one theme of the critique of the protocol has been the issue of democratic participation.  One way in which that is being addressed is through this mechanism that has been put in in respect of the assembly.  I am just highlighting that there is a discussion as to whether this also means there needs to be a continuing Northern Ireland voice within the European Union in some way, including in the European Parliament.  I say this just to highlight that that conversation has been ongoing.  I refer, for example, to work showing that it would be possible for the Irish Government to deal with voting rights issues.  There are also mechanisms such as observer status for people in Northern Ireland to ensure there is some form of continuing participation.<\/p> <p>  We are potentially heading into never-ending forms of negotiation at multiple levels all at the same time.  There is obviously the issue of re-establishing our power-sharing institutions in Northern Ireland.  There will be an ongoing conversation between the European Union and the UK because, as we know, the withdrawal agreement and the protocol are just the beginning - I am sure we are all delighted about that - of a long conversation about the future relationship and where it will go.  When negotiations are ongoing, it is always possible to find ways in which some of these reform proposals can be implemented practically.<\/p> <p>  Although I may sound rather despairing today, on this island we have gone to places that in the past people would never have expected us to go, and remarkable things have happened.  We are in a challenging and difficult moment.  I do not want to do anything here that would underplay that, but nor do I want to do anything that would talk us into an even worse space.  The things I am outlining and which we have talked about today can be done.  There are proposals to take a number of them forward.  I think they will benefit people on both parts of this island so I remain optimistic that progress on all these issues is possible in the time ahead.  The committee can tell me whether or not that optimism is wildly misjudged.  If, however, we do not frame this within a more comprehensive human rights framework, we will store up problems for the future.<\/p> <p>  One point made in the report we talked about earlier, which got rather lost in the public conversation, is that we have real anxieties about the rights of British citizens on this island in the future arrangements.  It is important that those rights are protected in the future, and the birthright guarantee speaks to that.  The UK will be a third country, essentially, outside the European Union, with all that that means for British citizens in the future.  There is, therefore, a need for specific conversations and a discussion about the wider human rights framework.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2019110700002#G00100","nonspeaker":"Professor Colin Harvey"},{"type":"speech","time":1573084800,"counter":1842,"content":"<p>I thank Professor Harvey.  This is really interesting stuff.  I have a few questions.<\/p> <p>  I refer generally to the reaction to the DeSouza case.  Many people were gobsmacked by the ruling.  There was a feeling of being held hostage to a citizenship to which one does not want to belong but which is imposed.  The ruling has an implication for rights of access to various courts, tribunals and so on.  When Professor Harvey says voting rights should be based not on residency but on citizenship, how would this work, given that Ms DeSouza, for example, has been told she is now a UK citizen?  Is there an implication that if citizens living in the North and abroad had presidential voting rights, it would skew the vote?<\/p> <p>  Regarding the European seats, it is essential citizens in the North have a voice.  Does Professor Harvey know how Europe views this?  Are discussions taking place over there?  I know that Martina Anderson, MEP, keeps the debate very much alive over there.  We have two extra seats in waiting.  There was at the time an idea that they should perhaps be devoted to giving a voice to the North.  Is that still a possibility?  One opinion is that at least one of the two seats should be devoted solely to representing the voice of the North in Europe as opposed to just having observer status.  I am not sure how comforting that would be to people living in the Six Counties.<\/p> <p>  Approximately 250,000 people left this island during the most recent downturn.  Unfortunately, this island has at times been known as one of tragedy and emigration.  I refer to the extension of voting rights not just to presidential elections but to other elections, whether D&aacute;il, local or whatever other elections deemed necessary, which is another conversation to be had.  The fear might be that the memories of 250,000 people, most of them young, who were forced to leave might skew results in local or national elections because their votes may go to more left-wing parties, or what are perceived to be more left-wing parties.  However, I believe they need to have a voice.<\/p> <p>  What are Professor Harvey's perceptions on the unfulfilled promises of the Good Friday Agreement?  Obviously, we did not foresee Brexit at the time the agreement was drafted under a UK Labour Government.  Since the Tories have come into power more recently on a platform of xenophobia and against migration, their co-operation or interest in resolving issues related to the Good Friday Agreement in the North has been called into question.  There is a contrast with regard to ownership of the difficulties that need to be addressed.  The Tories have no interest in addressing them except for their own ends and have no interest in the bill of rights we need for the entire island.<\/p> <p>  I have one more question.  I participated in a debate on the European health insurance card in the Seanad about two weeks ago.  While I am thankful the Government has proposed to bring in a card to cover citizens in the North, unfortunately people will have to load up the card and if anything happens abroad, they will have to pay for their treatment and then submit a claim to be reimbursed.<\/p><p>It is a move in the right direction but it is very disappointing that one might have to source anything from &euro;500,000 to &euro;1 million for repatriation and then come back, find one's receipts and send them in to the HSE for a refund, whenever that might happen.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2019110700002#G00200","speaker":"1388","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1573084800,"counter":1844,"content":"<p>Barry Andrews and Deirdre Clune would probably be upset because their two seats have already been allocated.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2019110700002#H00200","speaker":"1309"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1573084800,"counter":1845,"content":"<p>We need to separate out a few things concerning the DeSouza case, which is not so much about removing Irish citizenship - that is not at issue - as it is about the imposition or conferral of British citizenship or identity on somebody without his or her consent and then the processes around renunciation.  Irish citizens voting in presidential elections is a distinctive issue as well, so it would not affect that.<\/p> <p>  There is a sense that the European Parliament question is one primarily for the Irish Government to determine in terms of what it wants to do.  Some clarity has been provided to the effect that if the Irish Government wanted to take that step it would be possible to do so.  I want to put it on the table today that that is going to be a remaining question.  It chimes with the debate that is happening.  Effectively, Northern Ireland is going to have what looks like a special status or arrangement going forward, for the reasons that were agreed regarding a hard border, protecting the agreement and ensuring North-South co-operation.  The question that also arises relates to a continuing voice for the North in the European institutions as well.  This is something the Government has looked at, is thinking about and could look at in further detail in the context of how it might be addressed.  I would encourage it to do so.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the electorate and how people might vote, Senator Devine is right that this often arises.  It reflects anxiety about how people might vote, which parties or individuals they might vote for or how it might impact.  There is a sense that we need more research on external voting to find out what is happening.  There is a mixed picture in terms of the impact.  There is work that talks about the lack of a distorting effect but Senator Devine has seen evidence in research to suggest that it can have a significant impact in elections.  I am not a politician, but my view on this is that, ultimately, when one is talking about the franchise and inclusion, at some point one has to trust the judgment of the electorate and the persuasion that will take place around that.  This might be a slightly provocative thing to ask, but does one ultimately simply abolish elections because individuals might vote for the wrong candidate or the wrong party?  I was reading on the train on the way down about a candidate for the Croatian presidential election who is planning a visit to Cork due to the forthcoming presidential election in Croatia.  I think what it will do is encourage people to engage in a much more proactive way with the North and with the Irish diaspora, to not simply sloganise in respect of \"Global Ireland\" but to make the latter meaningful in terms of actual civil and political rights.  What is missing from the conversation thus far brings me back to the comments I heard this morning about the opportunities and benefits for this island of enhanced engagement with Irish citizens around the world and making sure that they remain fully involved in what is happening here.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the Good Friday Agreement, at the risk of boring everyone to tears this afternoon and repeating myself, I think it is a great question, my own sense is that I am quite concerned about where a future British Government might be going in relation to some of the issues mooted in the opening statement.  The language of Brexit and the approach that has been adopted, the fractious and febrile nature of politics, the hostile environment that has been created towards rights and equality issues cause me a lot of concern as a person who works in the area of human rights law and has done for a long time.  Who knows what will happen in the election, but where a future British Government might be going could be a very troubling place in relation to the protection of human rights and equality.  The Good Friday Agreement has a number of commitments in that regard.  Much of what we are hearing conflicts with the values that underpin that document, but I still firmly believe that the answer does ultimately rest in getting back to that document and to the things that were noted there, the things that were promised there and the guarantees that are there and ensuring they are implemented.<\/p> <p>  Members will not be surprised to learn that one consequence of all that, based on the report I have compiled, is that there are people who are at this point and who are not unreasonably pondering the constitutional future of the North in light of the picture that is emerging.  It seems to me that it would be remarkable if people were not doing so at the moment because we are in troubling times.  Everything I have said has been around de-escalating those conversations, highlighting problems but also highlighting solutions, de-dramatising the conversation and underlining the importance of a human rights framework.  I am deeply worried about the impact on the Good Friday Agreement, its institutions and its values in terms of what is being planned and what might emerge from a future British Government.  Let me be clear: none of the members are in any doubt that the Conservative Party is clear on where it wants to go in the future relationship with the European Union.  In Scotland and in other parts of the UK, people are asking themselves hard questions.  On of the questions they are asking relates to whether other people want to go there as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2019110700002#H00300","nonspeaker":"Professor Colin Harvey"},{"type":"speech","time":1573084800,"counter":1846,"content":"<p>I welcome Professor Harvey's contribution.  The issues he has put before the committee are those that need amplification.  There must be a greater awareness of some of the issues that have not been implemented that were critical and essential parts of the Good Friday Agreement.  We need a better public discussion and public debate on that.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the extension of the electoral franchise, it is quite ironic that as Professor Harvey made his presentation as a debate was taking place in the D&aacute;il on a 2018 report from the implementation group on Seanad reform.  We are not very quick to bring about electoral reform in this State.  It is not an issue that gains a lot of urgency.  My predecessor as a Fianna F&aacute;il Deputy in Cavan-Monaghan was the late T&aacute;naiste, John Wilson.  As Minister for Education he sponsored a referendum in July 1979 to extend the university franchise to the graduates of the then National Institute for Higher Education, Dublin and the National Institute for Higher Education, Limerick, now Dublin City University and the University of Limerick.  The referendum was passed to enable the extension of the university franchise to those colleges in addition to Trinity College and the constituent colleges of the National University of Ireland but the necessary legislation and regulations have never been implemented.<\/p><p>During that period, the Oireachtas has failed to implement even that small measure of electoral reform.  That is disappointing.  I would never be one to believe that electoral reform will happen quickly.<\/p><p> The Taoiseach was asked about the referendum at the F&eacute;ile an Phobail leaders' debate in which I participated in Belfast last August.  He indicated hat the referendum would be proceeding.  That particular issue came before the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade, and Defence for pre-legislative scrutiny.  As a committee, we deemed the pre-legislative scrutiny unnecessary in order to ensure that the necessary legislation could be enacted very quickly.  To my memory, that was last July but nothing has happened in the meantime.  As Deputy Breathnach said, the proposed referendum date has not been adhered to.  That is disappointing.  I instance the small measure of Seanad reform that was envisaged in 1979, provided for in a referendum and has not yet been implemented.<\/p><p> In all the discussions we have had at this committee and at the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade, and Defence, one of the issues that colleagues and I have put forward is that, in any Brexit negotiations, there must be no diminution in any way of the workings of the Good Friday Agreement or, indeed, in the potential of the agreement.  Bertie Ahern stated in the late 1990s that the Good Friday Agreement was not just about the absence of violence, although I am not in any way diminishing the importance of the end of violence on our island.  Bertie Ahern, Tony Blair, George Mitchell and the party leaders who were all signatories to that agreement emphasised that a lot of work would have to be done to ensure that it was implemented.  The work was not done when the agreement was put in place.  The clear message was that the Governments and political parties would have to work hard to ensure that all aspects of the agreement would be implemented to the benefit of all the people on this island. Unfortunately, that has not happened.<\/p><p> My understanding, and please correct me if I am wrong, is that the bill of rights would have been a matter of responsibility for the British Government and, unfortunately, it has not been implemented.  Does Professor Harvey believe that the absence of the Northern Ireland Executive and the assembly leaves a leadership role vacant?  Is there a huge lacuna or vacuum there in driving forward issues that are of critical importance to the people of Northern Ireland and elsewhere on the island?  There is a huge onus on the two Governments and the political parties in Stormont, particularly in the context of the Executive and the assembly, to ensure that they are working to implement the mandate that was given to all of us through the referenda, North and South, in May 1998 when the Good Friday Agreement was overwhelmingly endorsed.  The political mandate that has been given to all of us, North and South, is not being implemented at the moment, unfortunately.  Our society is worse off for that.<\/p><p> Professor Harvey mentioned a near permanent close relationship for Northern Ireland with the European Union post Brexit.  I sincerely hope he is right in that view because Brexit is going to happen even if we would prefer that it did not.  The withdrawal agreement that is there now is a lesser agreement, from an Irish point of view, than the one reached between the EU and former Prime Minister May.  There is a lack of clarity about what will happen after Britain leaves the European Union.  The Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union, when asked in the immediate aftermath of Mr. Johnson getting agreement with the European Union, indicated that there would be no paperwork needed for customs regulations on products moving between Britain and Northern Ireland.  He corrected that half an hour later and said documentation and determinations would be needed.<\/p><p> I remember reading a quote from a former Permanent Secretary of the British Department for Exiting the European Union.  He indicated that customs regulations would pose particular difficulties and that the matter is not straightforward.  He used a phrase that one might associate with my part of the country, the south of Ulster, more than with the City of London.  He said the customs regulations would be ferociously complicated.  That was not indicating that things would be simple or there would be easy arrangements to put in place.  We sincerely hope that is not correct because we all understand that the best possible relationship between Britain and the European Union is essential for the good of our country.  We want to try and minimise obstacles to trade and to us going about our everyday living.<\/p><p> It is welcome that the professor has highlighted the issues that need to be progressed.  A wider public debate on these important subjects is essential.  There is an absolute need to implement those outstanding elements of the Good Friday Agreement that have not yet been implemented for the benefit of the people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2019110700002#H00400","speaker":"1270","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1573084800,"counter":1848,"content":"<p>I welcome the fact that we have the Bill and the Referendum Commission, although I am conscious of the glacial pace of change.  The Convention on the Constitution vote in favour of voting extension was in 2013 and it is now 2019.  I do, in a sense, commend the Government on taking this step but I encourage it to take the next one.  We need a date for the referendum and a commitment to taking this forward.  It is also welcome that there is an indication that the Government is committed to the more inclusive option on this as well.  We need to move to the next step on that now.<\/p> <p>  The theme for my next answers is Brexit.  Ireland is co-guarantor of the agreement and the co-guarantors have responsibilities.  We all know that Brexit has severely damaged relationships that will need to be rebuilt because the agreement will not work without robust British-Irish co-operation underpinning it.  That co-operation has been damaged by Brexit.  The Irish Government has a strong role in advancing many of the issues I have raised today in the context of those conversations.  Although we have mentioned the Executive, there is also the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference.  The latter needs a reboot.  It needs to become a much more robust institution than it is at present.  It could be a vital forum in the future in the context of the matters we are discussing now.<\/p> <p>  The bill of rights rests with the British Government.  It is absolutely clear in the agreement that this should have been done by means of Westminster legislation but that has not happened.  There is an obligation on the British Government to take this forward.  It has proposals and there is a need to advance this debate.  It joins a list of issues which I am going to link together in answering the question on the Executive posed by Deputy Brendan Smith.  The difficulty is that the issues I have identified are causing the problems that we see in the institutions.  There is a sense in the work that I have done and continue to do with civil society organisations and others that, by 2016, people had had enough of the rights and equality commitments of the agreement not being delivered.  If we are able to address some of the things we have talked about here today, then there will be political institutions that can function on a sustainable basis in the longer term.  Without the underpinning human rights and equality that was anticipated in the agreement, there is a rights and equality crisis in Northern Ireland that really needs to be addressed.<\/p> <p>  It is not just about getting institutions up and running, it is also about institutions getting up and running on the right basis in order that they do not collapse again after 12 months.<\/p><p>We need to address some of the rights and equality challenges.  Essentially the withdrawal agreement and the protocol were entirely predictable given the British Government's negotiating positions and red lines, and the agreed objectives on a hard border, the agreement and North-South co-operation.  The protocol that has emerged was entirely legally predictable and has undergone a number of variations.  It has been transformed from a backstop that was essentially temporary unless and until a more permanent arrangement was in place.<\/p><p> We need to be clear that we are in this position because of the British Government's approach to these negotiations.  I do not need to tell this committee that the North does not want to leave the European Union.  It voted to remain and that has been confirmed.  As the softer versions of Brexit for the UK as a whole have been largely ruled out by the British Government, in order to protect the things that were agreed in the joint report of December 2017 we were always going to need a legally operable special arrangement.  Nobody involved in the negotiations and nobody following those negotiations closely should be surprised that is where we have eventually end up.<\/p><p> I underline the point that the majority of people in Northern Ireland do not want to be in this conversation at all; they do not want to leave the EU.  However, in the event of leaving, the protocol is a rather predictable legal measure that has been transformed.  It reflects the need for special arrangements to do the things that people wanted to do based on the red lines the British Government has had throughout the entire process.  Ultimately, it is an exercise in legally limiting damage to protect some of the things we are discussing right now.<\/p><p> No diminution has found a place in the protocol.  It is interesting that the protocol refers to the need for no diminution in issues of rights and equality.  I realise that there is much highly politicised comment on that protocol at the moment.  I underline the point that the special arrangement that has emerged in that protocol was an entirely predictable outcome of the shared negotiating objectives and the red lines the British Government set down for the discussions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2019110700002#J00200","nonspeaker":"Professor Colin Harvey","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1573084800,"counter":1850,"content":"<p>Professor Harvey spoke about parity of esteem, equality and so on.

Although we have the Human Rights Act, the agreement anticipated something more.  The Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission provided advice in that regard.  The answer is really very simple.  It is often a source of frustration working in the area of human rights law.  The clue to human rights is in the title.  They are not rights that attach to a citizenship or an identity; they are rights that belong to everyone in society.  The comprehensive human rights framework envisaged by the bill of rights proposals do not belong to any one community or political party; they belong to everyone.<\/p> <p>  As the Chairman rightly said, there is often a challenge in that message being heard.  Our society has felt the loss of that comprehensive human rights framework.  It would have made a difference and solved some, but not all, of our challenges.  I would like to highlight one at the moment.  I am very concerned about the social and economic impact of Brexit in the region where I live.  It will have a devastating effect on some of the most marginalised and vulnerable communities in our society.  Communities that have not really felt any peace dividend will suffer even more as a result of all of this.  The proposals on a bill of rights included provision for social and economic rights.  I am concerned that social and economic rights, the bread-and-butter rights issues that people can relate to, are still second-class human rights and that needs to be addressed.  That is why we need to get back to thinking about the comprehensive human rights framework the agreement anticipated.<\/p> <p>  If we get a date for a referendum and if that referendum is lost, the impact on Irish citizens who do not live in the State will be devastating.  It is the least that could be done for Irish citizens living in the North of this island or elsewhere and would recognise that citizenship has some tangible meaning.  It is a rather modest specific reform in one particular election - the election for President.  If that referendum was lost, it would have a very damaging impact on how this State interacts with Irish citizens in the North and elsewhere in the future.  It would have a personal impact.<\/p> <p>  I have tried to emphasise today that this is about the human stories, the historical experience, the complex history of this island, of families, relations and friends elsewhere.  The rejection of that would send a signal and would be potentially devastating to Irish citizens who live elsewhere.  The electorate in this part of the island is more generous than that.  I would put my faith in our ability to work through some of the concerns and anxieties people have, deal with some of the myths and provide the evidence, and underline that this is a rather reasonable, justifiable and proportionate change.  Many other states around the world do this successfully and this State also has the capacity to do that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2019110700002#K00300","nonspeaker":"Professor Colin Harvey"},{"type":"speech","time":1573084800,"counter":1852,"content":"<p>On that positive note, I bring the meeting to a close.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2019110700002#K00400","speaker":"1309"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1573084800,"counter":1853,"content":"<p>The joint committee adjourned at 3.49 p.m. until 2.15 p.m. on Thursday, 21 November 2019.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Joint Oireachtas Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government","time":1573084800,"counter":1854},{"type":"unspoken","content":"<p>Th\u00e1inig an Comhchoiste le ch\u00e9ile ag 09:30<\/p><p>The Joint Committee met at 09:30<\/p><p>COMHALTA\u00cd A BH\u00cd I L\u00c1THAIR \/ MEMBERS PRESENT:<\/p><p>Teachta\u00ed D\u00e1la \/ Deputies Seanad\u00f3ir\u00ed \/ Senators Mick Barry, Victor Boyhan, Pat Casey, Martin Conway, Mattie McGrath, Jennifer Murnane O'Connor.

I am also leading the delegation here today and it is important to explain that the reason I have taken this role is to use Cl&uacute;id&rsquo;s property expertise to help resolve an issue which is crippling many ordinary households and negatively affecting the reputation of apartment living, which is a key component of long-term planning for our urban centres.<\/p> <p>  I want on behalf of the Construction Defects Alliance to thank the committee for giving us this opportunity to address the real-life experience of homeowners who are having to deal with structural defects in their homes which have arisen through no fault of their own but for which they have been left holding the baby.  We hope that our deliberations here today will contribute to a process through which this committee&rsquo;s own report, Safe as Houses?, which is now nearly two years old, can be successfully implemented and some relief delivered to the tens of thousands of homeowners affected by construction defects.<\/p> <p>  I want to begin by explaining who we are and what the Construction Defects Alliance is as we have just recently formed.  The alliance is an informal grouping which has the support of the Apartment Owners Network, AON, and currently involves owners and owners&rsquo; management companies, OMCs, from over a dozen different locations around the greater Dublin area which are affected by construction defects.  We also have active involvement from some of the professionals who are working with the owners and OMCs concerned.  Our panel today is made up of representatives of those different elements as well as Des McCabe from the Apartment Owners Network.  As the committee may recall, representatives of AON appeared before this committee in April 2018 and set out issues, including fire safety construction defects, impacting on apartments and multi-unit developments.  The alliance has its origins in the Beacon South Quarter lobby group, of which I am a member, which has been campaigning for the last couple of years for action for homeowners affected by defects.  Through our campaigning work, other individual owners and OMCs approached us and got involved in the campaign.  Ultimately, as the numbers began to grow, it made sense for us to create the Construction Defects Alliance.<\/p> <p>  At the moment, the alliance includes people involved in over a dozen developments near Swords, Blanchardstown, south Meath, the city centre, Dublin 6 and 12, Stillorgan and Sandyford.  We know that there are many more developments around the country affected by defects and we hope that the publicity surrounding today&rsquo;s hearing will encourage them to join us.  In fact, over the past couple of days we have had other people contact us.  We have one very simple aim, even though it is not simple, which is the implementation of the Safe As Houses? report.<\/p> <p>  Most of the members of the alliance own homes in apartment developments, the majority of which were built during the Celtic tiger era.  However, some pre-dated that era and some defective homes have also come along after 2008.<\/p> <p>  Returning to Celtic tiger era apartments, it is worth bearing in mind that CSO data shows that over 131,000 apartments were built during the period 2000 to 2008, just before the financial crash and deep recession.  We simply do not know how many are affected by defects.  Indeed, because of the consequences, in terms of potential remediation costs, loss of property value and difficulty in selling their homes, many homeowners simply do not want to know if their apartments or houses are affected by fire or other defects.  From a health and safety point of view, however, this is an appalling vista and we cannot continue with a hear no evil, see no evil approach to the issue of fire and other defects.  We do not even have to mention Grenfell Tower to see where that road leads.<\/p> <p>  Coming back to try to estimate the scale of the problem, Keenan Property Management has publicly stated that 70% of the apartments in its portfolio are affected by defects.  Taking that as a possible measure of the scale of the problem leads us to the figure of almost 92,000 apartments being affected by defects.<\/p> <p>  The seriousness of defects and the scale of the costs involved in remediating the problem varies from location to location.  In Beacon South Quarter where there are almost 900 apartments, the cost of fire remediation works is over &euro;9 million.  Each owner has been levied for the costs of these and other works and the average bill is almost &euro;13,500 per apartment.  Some bills are higher and some are lower depending on the size of the apartments concerned.<\/p> <p>  Beacon also has considerable water ingress problems but we are in the middle of negotiating a settlement for an insurance claim on them.  Depending on the outcome of that process, we may need to go back to the homeowners.<\/p> <p>  In a number of adjacent developments where the owners there do not yet want to out themselves - about which I will say more shortly &ndash; the remediation costs are even higher.  In one development, owners were levied a charge of &euro;16,500 each and given three months to come up with the money.  In another location, estimates are for around &euro;25,000 per apartment, which is very significant.<\/p> <p>  As public representatives, sensitive to their constituents&rsquo; concerns, I am sure they are aware that this situation causes the homeowners concerned huge stress because of the financial burden, considerable worries because of the spectre of fire safety and also impacts on the relationships between owners, their OMCs and the agents acting on behalf of the OMCs.  All of which undermines the very idea that one&rsquo;s home is a sanctuary.  Some of my colleagues here today will attest to that later in the proceedings.<\/p> <p>  I will address the worries over fire safety first.  As one can imagine, all the talk over recent times about fires in Grenfell Tower has had a profound effect on people living in properties that are not secure from a fire perspective.  It is a well-founded worry.  In Beacon alone there have been eight fires in recent years with some apartments being absolutely gutted.  We also know that people died as a result of a fire in Verdemont in Blanchardstown; a terrace of houses in Newbridge, Co Kildare was destroyed by fire in the not-too-distant past; and considerable damage was done to the Metro Hotel in Ballymun when people were resident in it.<\/p> <p>  It is because of this threat that OMCs are obliged to act to remediate fire defects and to take additional fire safety measures.  In Beacon again, we have employed additional fire wardens on a 24\/7 basis as well as installing additional fire alarms.  All of this costs money and has led to hikes in annual service charges, on top of mortgage payments and the remediation levies.<\/p> <p>  On the financial side, the OMCs need to get as much money as possible upfront in order to get the remediation works done.  There is no point in starting works without the funds to pay the contractors concerned. The need to get money upfront places huge strains on owners who have to find the resources to pay the levies in addition to all of their other costs.  <\/p> <p>  In Beacon, we have a number of large institutional owners who can afford to pay upfront with individual owners being largely forced to borrow at interest rates of 9% or 10%, or pay it out of cashflow if they can.  It is important to stress here that my involvement in this campaign, and that of Cl&uacute;id and other institutional owners, is nothing to do with extracting any financial benefit from the misery of individual homeowners.  To be clear, we are not looking for or expecting to get redress for ourselves.  Our sole focus is on individual homeowners.<\/p> <p>  Coming back to the issue of the financial burden being experienced by homeowners, it is only fair to say that it is placing huge stress on many people and we know some are really struggling to pay their levies.  Another aspect of this stress is that many homeowners are worried about the impact on their lenders and insurance if and when they find out about the defects, as well as the real concern that they may have difficulty in selling their property.  These worries are why so many of the people involved in the alliance are happy to talk to their public representatives but will shy away from the media, which is why so many of them are sitting in the Public Gallery and not before the committee.<\/p> <p>  The various stresses experienced by homeowners are also, in turn, impacting on relationships within the different developments.  For example, the OMCs&rsquo; agents are the ones tasked with collecting the levies.  This is not easy and can sometimes involve legal proceedings which are not pleasant for anyone concerned.  In other cases, the OMC directors, who are only volunteers after all, are having to levy sums of money which their neighbours are deeply unhappy about and this can cause a lot of difficulty for neighbourly relations.  Remember that all of this stress and strain arises through no fault of any of the people involved, yet they are the ones left to mop up after other people&rsquo;s failings.<\/p> <p>  Given the human dimension that I have just outlined, it might not be too hard for the committee members to imagine the deep frustration that owners of defective homes experience when they hear Ministers say that this issue is a \"private contractual matter\" and nothing to do with the State.  The Construction Defects Alliance would strongly challenge the notion that the State has no responsibility in this matter because the defects concerned are all breaches of the building regulations which came into effect in 1990 but which the State did not properly enforce.  Unfortunately, this was the latest in a long line of disastrous \"light touch\" approaches to regulation in Ireland.  The mantra of this being a \"private contractual matter\" really grates with homeowners who feel isolated.  They are concerned as most of us have made and are making considerable efforts to hold developers and contractors to account but to no avail.<\/p><p>For example, we in Beacon South Quarter instructed our solicitors at the expense of the owners to explore if we could take a case against the contractors as the developers had already gone bankrupt, as is the case in so many developments.  Our solicitors concluded that, at best, we had a 20% chance of success and that such a case would cost &euro;750,000 at a minimum.  Rightly, we decided that it would be imprudent to take a case.  Meanwhile, some of those involved in the construction process at Beacon and elsewhere are going on about their business, including getting substantial public contracts, while the owners are left to pick up the tab.  This is another reason owners of defective homes are so deeply frustrated.<\/p><p> Alliance members see that owners of homes with pyrite and mica have had redress schemes set up, just on the cusp of the local and European elections earlier this year, and we know of many apartment developments where arms of the State such as NAMA and local authorities have paid for remediation works.  Why them and not us and why, two years on from the adoption of the Safe as Houses? report, has nothing been done regarding the implementation of its recommendations?<\/p><p> As I mentioned, the Construction Defects Alliance&rsquo;s aim is to get this committee&rsquo;s own proposals in Safe as Houses? implemented.  It is worth recalling what they are.  They are the establishment of a redress scheme to assist homeowners with latent defects, the provision of an information and advice service for those affected by defects, and a redress scheme to be funded through an industry levy matched by Government funding, tax write-offs or interest-free loans.  Based on pronouncements from Ministers, the current Government does not appear to support the committee&rsquo;s proposals, although we note with interest that some parties have indicated support for these measures and others are moving in this direction.  We hope that by the time of next year&rsquo;s general election, we will have sufficient commitments on board to ensure that the next programme for Government contains firm commitments to right the wrong that has been done to the owners of homes with structural defects.<\/p><p> However, while the Construction Defects Alliance is focused on delivering the Safe as Houses? report&rsquo;s recommendations, we are eager to explore if the current Government could facilitate soft loans to help ease the pain for owners who are having to pay levies - on top of their mortgages and service charges - to remediate defects.  It is important to say that there is a strong precedent for the State providing loans for home improvements at soft rates.  For years, local authorities provided home improvement loans of up to &euro;15,000 over 15 years at 2.75% and that while many local authorities do not do so anymore, some still do.  Why can the terms of this scheme not be broadened to include those who are owners of homes with structural defects that have had a levy for remediation works imposed upon them?  Local authorities have the experience and infrastructure to administer such loans.  Even those that are not offering the home improvement loans anymore are administering the Rebuilding Ireland home loans.  The Housing Finance Agency can access funds at close to 0% interest, which as far as we are aware is off-book from the State&rsquo;s point of view, and that money can be provided to owners through the local authorities.  In this way, owners can be assisted in getting access to cheaper money, which will allow them pay their levies upfront, thus facilitating the remediation works, paying over a longer period, and easing the pressure on their cashflow.  From the State&rsquo;s perspective, such a proposition does not involve it signing the dreaded blank cheque and still enables it to assist people who are experiencing real stress and pressure.<\/p><p> We also think that a system of tax breaks should be put in place akin to the home renovation improvement scheme to help take the sting out of the levies homeowners have to pay.  The Beacon South Quarter Lobby Group proposed such a measure in its pre-budget submission, which was received by Government in early July.  Given that the Finance Bill has only recently been published, maybe this is something that could be moved upon quickly.  It is important to reiterate that these proposals are not our preferred solution but they represent acceptable interim measures that would offer some relief to those affected by structural defects they did not cause.<\/p><p> I hope this opening statement sets out in broad terms the issues facing tens of thousands of homeowners throughout the country, in particular the stress and strains that the thing they most dreamed of - having a home of their own - is now causing them and their neighbours.  As I said earlier, my colleagues can and will outline much more eloquently the nature of this lived experience during the questions and answers to follow.  The owners of defective homes are deeply frustrated at the inaction that has surrounded their situation, but the committee can begin the process of helping them today.  We want to see the committee's own report implemented, but short of that, surely it is not beyond the capability of all concerned to set up a scheme of soft loans to help ease the burden on these hard-pressed citizens as well as putting in place tax breaks.  I again thank the committee for asking the Construction Defects Alliance and the Apartment Owners' Network to appear before it this morning.  We look forward to engaging with members' questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019110700002#F00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Kath Cottier","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1573084800,"counter":1864,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Cottier.

I welcome the creation of the Construction Defects Alliance.  A number of members have worked with homeowners over the past five or six years.  The first thing that always stands out is that people feel lost and unsure of what to do.  They do not know whether they should pay significant sums of money for legal advice, and they are very scared about speaking out publicly because of the implications for them and their families.  The fact that there is now a focal point where people can come together, even if they wish to do so anonymously, to get support and information is invaluable, so I commend everybody involved.  It adds another voice to the ongoing campaign, because many of us have been speaking about this in the House for two or three years, and the more voices there are, the better.<\/p> <p>  This is not just my view but that of this committee because we agreed it in the report.  It is very important to keep saying this, particularly in light of the response we continually get from Government.  It is our view that in the first instance, the developers that were responsible for building shoddy homes should pay.  Those of us who put a lot of time and effort into listening not just to people experiencing latent defects but professionals in the field came to that view on the basis of all the information we heard.  I say this because from the very first time the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government responded to this report in the Oireachtas to last night on \"Drivetime\", there is a phrase the Government keeps using, which is that the State cannot take on full liability for all historic latent defects in the State.  Nobody has ever asked the State to do that.  As a committee, we must emphasise that what is being asked for here is not a blank cheque from the State to take on all liability at all times in all circumstances.  In fact, in the first instance, we want the developers to be made pay.<\/p> <p>  However, the State has a responsibility.  As evidence that I do not have much of a social life and spend far too much time reading about these things, I went back and read all of the Oireachtas debates that led to the 1994 legislation.  Throughout all of the debates from most of the contributors, they deliberately designed this in such a way as to ensure that the State would have no legal liability and the industry would be trusted to do the right thing.  There were Deputies in the House at the time who were proposing an independent inspection regime either by the local authorities or others, which many of us in this committee favour.  People kept saying that we could not do that because it would add too much cost onto the developer and place too much liability on the State.  They had the option.  People in this House urged the State to have the kind of independent regime that many of us recommend in the Safe As Houses? report and the State chose not to do that.  It was a deliberate decision so, in fact.  Its liability is not just that it did not properly implement the regulations from the 1994 Act but that it designed the Act in such a way that it facilitated some of this behaviour.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the report's recommendations, it is very important that people understand what we are asking for.  What we are asking for in the first instance is something not unlike the Residential Tenancies Board - an independent non-judicial body properly funded by Government to which people who discover latent defects can go and get independent and free legal advice and that has the legal power to bring the parties - affected homeowners and the builders or developers - together and, through mediation or legally binding adjudication, force a resolution.  This is not a huge financial undertaking by the State, so even if the State is not going to create a fund, which I will come to, at a very minimum, it could do that.  We already have a model that works and the State could do that in the first instance.<\/p> <p>  I would like the State to explore with the Attorney General whether it is possible to pursue not just the developer if the trading entity is still in existence but the directors of a previous trading entity if they have dissolved that company and created a new building contractor-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019110700002#G00300","speaker":"1215"},{"type":"speech","time":1573084800,"counter":1867,"content":"<p>I am concerned that we have a second session and everybody wants to make a contribution.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019110700002#G00600","speaker":"1357"},{"type":"speech","time":1573084800,"counter":1868,"content":"<p>I am almost done.

Our committee was deliberately agnostic on the preferred funding mechanism so the proposal could not be shot down.  One of our other recommendations was for a fire safety audit to discover the full extent of this, as recommended by the Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland.  Will the witnesses tell us more about the basis of the figure of 92,000?  Will some of the homeowners take us through their personal experience from the point of discovery to now, so we can get a sense of it?<br\/><br\/>New regulations were introduced in 2014.  We are now beginning to see significant examples of exactly the same kind of shoddy practices in post-2014 developments.  Some of them have been widely reported in the newspapers as pre-2014 developments.  The other recommendations of our report, which concerned strengthening building control for current and future builds, must also be returned to.  The <i>Irish Examiner <\/i>ran a very detailed piece on Monday of this week that highlighted a very substantial case in my own constituency.  Somebody built a development of 44 apartments with no building control compliance whatsoever.  Today, a year on from the discovery of the defects, it is fully tenanted.  The local authority is doing what it should do and is considering legal action.  This was built in 2017.  It has all of the problems the witnesses have experienced, if not more, despite being built since the Building Control (Amendment) Regulations 2014.  We have to return to that issue.

I have been living in Ireland for 29 years but I am originally from Bradford, which unfortunately has a history with fire as the committee members probably know.  I am acutely aware of the dangers of this kind of thing.  I also work in the hospitality industry, where one is constantly aware of the danger of fire.  It is not so bad now, but at the start it was quite an emotional stress to have tenants relying on me to ensure that their living quarters were safe.  It is fair and reasonable for them to expect that.  There was no real advice from the management agency.  In fairness, it was all new to the agency as well.  At the time we had no engineers who had done any detailed work.  It is quite a considerable stress to know that there could be a fire and one might not be protected.  In fact, we did not take any tenants with children after that.<\/p> <p>  The financial stress is even worse, but that does not affect the tenants who live there.  The cost roughly amounts to &euro;220 to &euro;250 per month for the past 30 months.  We have had to budget to pay for that.  It is a hardship, but I can afford it.  There are families that definitely cannot.  It is not that they will not pay; they cannot do so.  That makes it all the harder for the rest of us, because we do not have enough money to complete the works.  The fire officer, who I believe is an arm of the State, says we have to fix this or action will be taken.  I assume this action will mean people cannot live there.  It is difficult for all of us.  I do not live there so I do not see it from day to day.  There have been eight fires in the complex in the past four years.  Each time I read about those I am worried and wonder which block it took place in.  Beacon South Quarter is probably one of the biggest complexes in the country.  It includes 890 apartments.  It is probably very complex to run.<\/p> <p>  In the initial stages after we found out about the defects, there was massive mistrust.  The National Asset Management Agency, NAMA, was also somewhat involved.  There was a breakdown in relations between the management company and the constituent body of private individual owners.  We basically thought this was a conspiracy to make us pay for other people's mistakes.  That could still be the case, but I very much doubt it.  There was a breakdown of trust in the relationship.  I was in the \"will not pay\" camp for a long time, feeling that this was totally unjust.  That did not go well.  For two years the problem stagnated.  Even so, we have probably been more pragmatic than most in that we found the problem and now we are starting to fix it.  There are developments out there where people are only just finding their problems.  They are absolutely astonished at the scale of what people got away with.  Somebody deliberately chose not to install fire-stopping above the corridor door outside my apartment.  That is scandalous.  An individual deliberately made that decision.  That individual is probably still working in the construction industry.  How long will this be allowed to continue?  We hear that apartments are still being built shoddily.  It is just not fair.  That is pretty much all I have to say.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019110700002#H00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Andrew Prior"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1573084800,"counter":1876,"content":"<p>I would like to comment from the point of view of the Apartment Owners' Network.

I have met a number of groups.  I represent the constituency of Dublin Fingal.  As many people will know, the area is growing.  As part of my work as a Deputy since 2007, I have seen the area grow and seen many examples of not just apartment developments but houses, homes and duplexes.  I live in an estate that is run by a owner management company so I am well aware of the issues and burdens placed on people there too.  That is why I have published three pieces of legislation on the OMC area, on sinking funds, and having a regulator for the sector, which is absolutely needed.  My proposals seek to improve things.  My colleague, Deputy Casey, will talk about building control amendment regulations, BCAR, and how we can ensure that theses things do not happen into the future.  We have a massive legacy issue that places an incredible human burden, financially and healthwise, on people.<\/p> <p>  Unfortunately, my area was plagued with pyrite and still is.  The genesis of the pyrite remediation scheme came about in Fingal and I was involved with that at the start.  There is a roadmap as to how we can deal with this matter.  For example, there is mica in Donegal and Sligo.  A scheme was established last year but no money was spent last year and, again, this year.  There are still homes with pyrite that have not gotten into the scheme.  If we have a scheme into the future one must remember that schemes take a lot of time to establish and there is a lot of red tape.  At least there is a mechanism for people to see there is some hope that one's home can be fixed.<\/p> <p>  What Mr. Prior put forward, and I know this from meeting people, is the stress generated when people walk into their own homes every single day and see problems that are presenting that are not fixed.  Many of these people will have bought at the top of the market.  Some people were struggling to pay high mortgages and then were hit with paying levies and, as Ms Cottier mentioned, people must pay quite extortionate interest rates.  However, solutions do exist.<\/p> <p>  I certainly think that the Home Building Finance Ireland, HBFI, which is an issue that a number of us have raised, can be considered in the short term as a way to provide finance to OMCs.  I agree with tax reliefs in the absence of a full remediation scheme but at the end of the day it is those who are responsible who should pay.<\/p> <p>  As I have seen in many instances, the original expert report on pyrite recommended that the industry be levied so that the insurance sector, the construction sector and the taxpayer paid a third each.  Inexplicably, the construction sector and the insurance industry were not levied.  Also, we had to proceed with the establishment of the scheme because we needed to get something up and running.  The taxpayers paid &euro;30 million a year to fix homes and took responsibility.  I completely disagreed  with that approach at the time.<\/p> <p>  I would like advice on the legal aspect and ensuring people do not do this again.  I believe there is a mechanism available through the Planning Act.  People are massively frustrated when they see the same developer or builder as built a development they know has massive defects build again in the same town or village.  In a few instances I have objected to developments on the basis of previous developments being substandard.  There is a mechanism in the Planning Act that allows a local authority to refuse permission on the basis of an incomplete estate but it is never invoked.  We need to strengthen the provision in law.<\/p> <p>  I ask the witnesses to discuss the Statute of Limitations.  In the last Oireachtas I published a Bill that amended the statute so it would not kick in until a defect had been independently verified, not from the date where one should have known.  I did that so there would be legal recourse and enough time for someone to take a legal challenge.  In many instances, the Statute of Limitations has expired, which is a big problem.  I ask the witnesses to give us examples of where people have discovered there are issues and their insurers have said the bond is finished or over ten years, which is another issue.  Homebond, in particular, has walked away from many of the structural defects and then one wonders why people bother to buy bonds in the first instance.  The Central Bank and the Ombudsman for Insurance must be involved in this aspect.  We also need to consider the licences of insurers, in particular, when one sees Homebond as the bond insurer on new estates, when I know that for multiple estates it has blankly refused to pay.  That is the insurance responsibility element of my query.  I ask the witnesses to comment on the Statute of Limitations and how changes to the Act would help.<\/p> <p>  This committee has done a lot of work on this area and, cross-party, is very serious about addressing the matter.  My own party is acutely aware of the seriousness of this issue.  We need to see movement in this regard.  At the start it would be great if we could do HBFI and tax relief.  Next, we have to consider the people who have already fixed their homes and carry a financial burden, and the retrospective nature of anything we do.  I have seen that happen already with people and will ask more questions in the next round.<\/p> <p>  I have found this meeting very useful.  I commend the witnesses on their opening statements and sensible recommendations.  The establishment of the Construction Defects Alliance, along with the Apartment Owners Network, that I know represents more than apartment owners, is welcome.  They have done a really good job on this over the last few years.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019110700002#J00600","speaker":"1228"},{"type":"speech","time":1573084800,"counter":1886,"content":"<p>Obviously representatives of Homebond are not here to comment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019110700002#J00700","speaker":"1304"},{"type":"speech","time":1573084800,"counter":1887,"content":"<p>I would love to bring Homebond in.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019110700002#J00800","speaker":"1228"},{"type":"speech","time":1573084800,"counter":1888,"content":"<p>We could invite them in the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019110700002#J00900","speaker":"1304"},{"type":"speech","time":1573084800,"counter":1889,"content":"<p>Yes, great.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019110700002#J01000","speaker":"1228"},{"type":"speech","time":1573084800,"counter":1890,"content":"<p>This issue will not be resolved today and we need to do further work on it.

We would like something to be encouraged along those lines.<\/p> <p>  As a managing agent we are the ones that go to the executive general meetings or annual general meetings.  We have to break the bad news to all of these members and explain that this is outside their normal budget.  By the time one gets to the EGM stage, where one is proposing levies, the impact is immediate.  As an agent one has to go straight to one's insurance company.  One has to notify it, as a duty of care, that it has a problem and that becomes a risk.  Instantly, the insurance premium is usually doubled if one is lucky to keep one's insurance cover at all.  The financial impact on owner management companies is immediate.  After that point, and before one reaches the EGM stage, one must employ fire consultants and quantity surveyors.  All of this is a consulting cost before one even reaches the meeting stage.  That is why this impact is immediate because, as soon as works are opened, defects are found.<\/p><p>We feel that the OMCs need support through State loans as well as the individual soft loan system.  We find it deeply frustrating.  We are usually at the coalface where we get abuse while trying to rectify and resolve issues.  On behalf of the members, we are deeply frustrated at the lack of financial support that we get for these matters.  There is a fireproofing contractor who has been put under pressure by local government, the fire office etc. to get work done.  Pressure is then put on members to try to pay up as quickly as they can.  They then hit cashflow issues because they have already paid for fire consultants and quantity surveyors, and so they have to collect that money as quickly as possible while also pl&aacute;m&aacute;sing the local authority to make sure that they are staying in line with the timescale of works necessary.

Since then, many other developments in Dublin Rathdown have made it public but I am aware of others that have not made it public because they are afraid to.  I welcome the formation of the Construction Defects Alliance and commend those in the Beacon South Quarter who helped to drive it, as outlined by Ms Cottier.  We would not tolerate this sort of public safety issue in the food industry or on the roads and I do not know why we tolerate it in our homes.  Surely it should be of paramount importance that people feel safe in their homes.  That is not happening.  The Green Party passed a motion with unanimous support in the D&aacute;il in 2017 calling for an independent regulator and redress scheme.  That was followed by amazing work in this committee to produce the Safe as Houses? report, yet we are in November 2019 and we are no further along.  I am truly worried that a tragedy will have to occur before Government pays attention to this shameful legacy.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Prior is a homeowner.  Will he elaborate on his own experience of finding out that there were defects?  How does he and the people he knows feel about living in that place?  Who does he turn to for advice when he hears this?  There is not even a helpline.  I always feel that homeowners are abandoned there.  There is no helpline, so who do they turn to for legal advice?  Does Mr. Prior know what sacrifices are being made by homeowners who are paying the levy to come up with the money?  Are people borrowing, going without medical care, pension contributions or school fees?  What legal pressure is there on people who simply cannot pay?  Do threatening letters come in?<\/p> <p>  I would like to recognise the bravery shown by many homeowners such as Mr. Prior, those in the Gallery and others who have come forward and even stood at the gates of Leinster House to campaign for the Government to act.  It is to be hoped that will lead to more happening.  Does Mr. Prior feel that the invisibility of people who are not coming forward is playing into the Government's hands?  If it does not see large numbers, does it feel that it can leave this to one side?  Does Mr. Prior feel that that is a factor?  How does he feel when the Taoiseach and Ministers stand up in the D&aacute;il, as they have done many times, and say that it is a private contractual issue?  How does he feel about the announcements of the mica redress scheme and the pyrite redress scheme, with nothing for him?  How widespread a problem does he think the construction defects are throughout the country and does he hear of many?  I hear of many defects.<\/p> <p>  Homeowners and prospective homeowners are still expected to put their faith in builders who are really self-regulating, even since 2014.  Should there be an independent regulator?  People simply do not trust builders to self-regulate.  The Government has a duty to protect homeowners and prospective homeowners against greed-driven building standards and incompetent rogue cowboy builders.  I am not saying that all builders are rogue or incompetent, but a number of builders and developers have done an extraordinary disservice to the many decent, hard-working people in the industry.  The tragic inferno at Grenfell is a stark reminder of the overriding principle of the safety of residents.  In the rush to build the houses that are so urgently needed, I believe that all houses and apartments must be built to an acceptable, safe standard.  What measures would the witnesses like the Government to take to tackle the issue?  Will the Apartment Owners' Network elaborate on its pre-budget submissions about the tax relief that could be used to assist homeowners?

Therefore, people are living with some uncertainty.<\/p> <p>  As a director of an owners' management company &mdash; there are other directors in the Gallery &mdash; I am aware that the issue of raising funds from the ownership is extremely difficult.

I am here today because I became a director of the owners' management company because the relationship between the directors and the membership was so broken.  There is a responsibility to keep people safe.  If one does not start the works, there is a risk that people will lose their homes.  Where else will they go to?  One is left with a dichotomy based on the question of what can be done for the best.  There are those who do not want to pay and those who cannot pay.

The problem with a non-profit-making entity, such as an owners' management company, is that it cannot decide to have less profit to cope with debt.  All the owners pay for everything.  Therefore, if there is debt, it is spread out among every owner, and this increases the levy charged to the owners who can afford to pay.  There are issues in this regard.  It really eats into the heart of directors.<\/p> <p>  The directors largely comprise a glorified residents' association.  There are those who volunteer for the role who face addressing defects worth millions of euro and having to manage, with the help of managing agents, contracts that are very complex and hard to deal with.  They must ask how they should proceed if they cannot get the money up front and how to separate the people who will not pay from those who cannot pay.  One has to go through these processes.  In Beacon South Quarter, we have used legal means to collect some of the debt.  I suppose we are in the final stages in terms of how we progress in that regard because we are pretty sure that everybody who can pay is doing so.  We have got some difficult decisions to make.  That is not unique to Beacon South Quarter; it is across the board.  If one does not pursue the debt, it goes to the other members.  They are already struggling and will have taken out loans.  That is the position.  I am an institutional owner as a director but the vast majority of directors are owner-occupiers in apartments who are faced with really difficult circumstances.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019110700002#L00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Kath Cottier"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1573084800,"counter":1908,"content":"<p>Deputy Noel Rock resumed the Chair.<\/p>"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1573084800,"counter":1909,"content":"<p>As a managing agent, one is not only collecting a levy but also collecting an inflated service charge.

A certain timescale has to be given because that is the timescale in which the work has to be done.  The contractor has to be paid at all costs.  Bearing in mind where a member has the same timeframe in which to pay the levy as well as the service charges, arrears are considered the same as a service charge that goes into arrears.

This is probably the number-one issue being reported to the network.  It is probably the main concern of owners and directors of owners' management companies.  It compounds the other issues associated with the management and regulation of owners' management companies in regard to sinking fund provisions and the collection of service charges.  It is compounding already-difficult issues concerning the running of an owners' management company and preparing for the future.  A latent defect on top is a bit of a bombshell from many owners' management companies to try to deal with.<\/p> <p>  We would all like to see the Safe as Houses? recommendations implemented.  From a practical point of view, it would help initially if owners' management companies could raise low-cost finance directly.  This issue is urgent.  People are not necessarily going to wait for the State to come running to the door to fix this.  They want to try to get a head start.  If low-cost finance were available to the owners' management company, the problem could be solved at a quicker rate.  Currently, because it is so difficult to collect service charges, a project that might take two or three years to complete might take five or six in reality.  It could take this long to have the money up front to complete the project.  If the owners' management company had the ability to raise low-cost finance up front, it would help at a practical level.  Also on a practical level, a tax relief for owner-occupiers would help.

There is no provision in legislation pertaining to service charges, sinking fund contributions or a levy like the one in question for tax relief for owner-occupiers.  Owner-occupiers have their mortgage repayments, day-to-day expenses and service charges.  Many are seeking credit union loans or a term loan from the bank.  Some face bills of between &euro;10,000 and &euro;15,000.  That is significant for an owner-occupier paying a mortgage.  The properties will often have been bought during the Celtic tiger era, at the height of the market.  Therefore, there might be big mortgages with repayments of perhaps &euro;1,000 plus per month.  Those affected might have another loan, with repayments of perhaps &euro;200 or &euro;300, to fund a levy for fire safety work.  Therefore, some relief for owner-occupiers is essential.  Even if there were some tax relief on the levy portion of the service charge, it would be useful.<\/p> <p>  My view, based on experience, is that along with the other issues facing the sector, and bearing in mind long-term sinking fund provisions for owners' management companies, existing sinking funds are probably not adequate in the long term as they are being cleared out to do the work in question.  Therefore, the fund is returning to zero for a building that probably has been constructed for 20 or 30 years.  Starting again from a sinking fund of zero means it will probably take 20 or 30 years to build it up to a decent level, unless significant contributions are made.  In another ten years, all the lifts might have to be replaced or a roof might need to be done, and then there would be no money in the sinking fund.  One would be back to a constant round of levies.  Frustration arises because residents believe it is never-ending.  If someone's management fee is &euro;1,500 or &euro;2,000 per year, he or she feels it should stay at that level for an extended period, accounting for inflation.  Now, however, the fees are jumping significantly and staying at elevated levels, potentially for the long term in some cases.<\/p><p>That is probably one of the biggest fears, people do not know where it is going to end. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019110700002#L00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Des McCabe","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1573084800,"counter":1915,"content":"<p>Having a sinking fund in a quasi-permanent state of crisis is always going to lead to a heightened level of anxiety for everybody.

Sometimes we think of urban areas.  It goes beyond those too, down to one-off rural houses, the self-builds.  A good friend of mine had no recourse because the damp course was put in the right place.  He lost the whole house and had to start again just because there was not enough oversight of the building. <\/p> <p>  I thank the witnesses for their stories.  I work in the hospitality industry and we are probably more aware of the importance of understanding how quickly a fire can spread in an apartment building and making sure that is dealt with.  Even having a practical, operational, addressable fire alarm system and ensuring that is functioning and working is important.  That has helped me in my industry and building because straightaway I will know where a fire is and go and put it out.  If there is no proper, functioning, working, addressable alarm system, the building will be lost.  If there is a place where the fire can spread, it escalates quickly.  <\/p> <p>  I thank the witnesses for coming today not to just complain but to propose practical solutions.  They mentioned low interest loans, tax breaks and the local authorities' home improvement loan scheme.  Why do we always reinvent the wheel when there is a mechanism that could be used for something like this?  Their presence today has brought another level of awareness to this issue.  One of the witnesses was here previously to discuss apartment owners and the sinking fund.  I was part of the committee that prepared a report on that.<\/p> <p>  The key point in that report is that, even today, the assigned certification process is not fit for purpose because the developer is paying the assigned certifier.  Until we get complete and total independence from that system, I honestly believe we will be wasting our time and will see the same issues cropping up time and again.  The argument that it will be too costly to do otherwise is a red herring.  It is not factual because the same certification can be done by an independent inspector at the same cost.  It just takes a change in mindset.  I know the witnesses could not put a value on it today but my party colleagues and I are here to do whatever we can.  We understand the depth and breadth of the issue and will support the witnesses in any way we can.

There needs to be an independent authority governing building control, the equivalent of an independent clerk of works that inspects all sorts of construction.  We have found that, with all the defects that are passed, a fire safety certificate that is issued through opinion of compliance through the relevant architects' consultants at the end of a build is based on the design drawings, not on the building.  Everything that is built should be inspected at certain points and signed off by an independent authority.  We would also like to see developers&rsquo; bonds being retained and used in the future.  There could be a recall system for returning those bonds to the development companies, the OMCs, for costing or supporting builders' defects in the future.

Not only should the developer be levied but also people, architects and main contractors should have that bond in place that is then held by the OMC.<\/p> <p>  People will not like this as it will hit their profit margins because the market does set its own price.  A starter house cannot be sold for more than &euro;500,000 because nobody will buy it.  That is the way it is and the way to get more houses on the land is to build starter houses.  The regulation will work and it will help with the invisibility issue.  People are scared to put their heads above the parapet because if they do, the value of their apartment might drop and they might not be able to sell their asset.  They cannot sell it in any case because whether they are invisible or visible, the purchaser will find out.  They might as well be visible and try to get something done about it.

It is not an exaggeration.  If one looks at the history of building control, powers were first given to the Minister to develop building control regulations in the 1960s.  The regulations were not drafted until the 1970s and it was then decided not to implement them.  The Stardust fire led to the resurrection of the 1984 Building Control Bill which is the Act that ultimately underpinned legislation that followed.  That was only further revised after Priory Hall.  The only two significant pieces of building control legislation we have came after very substantial tragedies, the first of which resulted in significant loss of life.  We must take that warning and not wait for a third tragedy before we have a proper system.<\/p> <p>  I want to put on record that there was a concerted effort to try to get amendments into the Home Building Finance Ireland Act to provide a specific loan product to management companies and owner occupiers with latent defects.  Not to re-fight old battles, because we have a good cross-party consensus here, I do think that, if there are committee members who think that an amended Home Building Finance Ireland, HBFI, could provide one vehicle for dealing with latent defects, we should work together.  There will be opportunities in legislation to deal with that.

I wish to merge two proposals.  On behalf of the entire committee, the Chair will write a letter to the Minister, outlining in brief what we have heard today and what our concerns are.  I do not mean that to be a report so there is no need for the clerks to panic over extra work.  We should express our concern that it is two years since the publication of our report and nothing has happened.  We should request that meeting with the committee.  I would like the Minister of State with responsibility for housing and urban development, Deputy English, and the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, and the building control and planning sections of the Department here for that.  We should also urge the Minister and Minister for State to meet with the group now that it has been formally set up because it is representing all affected and not just Beacon South Quarter.

We are here to talk about IORP II, which is a European directive to try to harmonise governance around pension arrangements in Europe.  IORP stands for institutions for occupational retirement provision and the primary objective of the directive is to try to harmonise governance and arrangements for institutions or collective schemes which provide retirement provisions.<\/p> <p>  By way of background, Ireland is a little bit unusual in what it considers to be an institutions for retirement provision or a collective scheme.  Ours is the only country in Europe where one-person arrangements are considered to be a collective scheme or institution.<\/p><p>More than 110,000 of those institutions are in Ireland.  That is because of the unusual position we take in counting one-man arrangement schemes as institutions. <\/p><p> The directive on institutions for occupational retirement provision, IORP II, recognises that there are many differences in pension arrangements throughout the various European countries.  The directive advises member states to tailor the provisions for smaller arrangements if they see fit to do so.  The UK availed of one of the clauses within the directive allowing a cost-benefit analysis to be carried out for smaller arrangements.  The UK concluded that the IORP II directive should not apply to any collective scheme with fewer than 15 members.  The administrators of arrangements with between 15 and 99 members were required to make themselves aware of what was set out in the directive but they did not have to apply it to their own schemes.  To our minds that is a very sensible approach. <\/p><p> The schemes in Ireland which have fewer than 100 members and will be affected if this is applied in full cover about 150,000 people.  These are typically small businesses, self-employed people or traders who are trying to make provision for retirement.  Their pension pots are modest.  Typically the salaries of people paying into these schemes are just above the industrial average wage.  The average pension pot size for one-man arrangements in Ireland is just over &euro;75,000.  UK cost analyses estimated that the base level cost of implementing this for smaller schemes would be &euro;500 in the first year of implementation and &euro;370 per annum thereafter.  If schemes were required to produce full audited accounts, another requirement outlined in the directive, that cost would be substantially higher, perhaps as high as &euro;3,000 per annum.  This is a disproportionate measure given the population at which it is directed.  The costs of introducing this could wipe out these scheme's investment returns.  That will have a significant impact on pot sizes at retirement.<\/p><p> When a country considers whether the directive should apply to smaller arrangements, it must consider the existing arrangements around the governance and protection of schemes.  We contend that these schemes already get very good information from the regulations that apply in Ireland.  Members of these schemes get annual benefit statements and projections of what they will get at retirement.  We do not really see what additional information people will get if the provisions are applied.  Regarding governance, I note that live company pension providers are overseen by both the Pensions Authority and the Central Bank.  Oversight is already very good, which should be taken into account in any cost-benefit analysis.<\/p><p> Our fear is that if IORP II is applied in full and the right to assess the benefits for smaller arrangements is not exercised, it could act as a barrier.  There will be more work involved for individuals in setting up and using schemes and for small companies in setting up arrangements for their employees.  The additional cost of putting it in place will reduce the size of the pension at retirement of those covered by existing arrangements.  There is also a danger that existing arrangements may simply cease to exist because of the administrative burden and overheads.  It would be strange to do this when there is general consensus around auto-enrolment and trying to encourage future pension provision.<\/p><p> We have three asks for the committee.  The first is for a cost-benefit review of the implementation of IORP II to be carried out by the Department for all schemes with fewer than 100 members.  We do not agree that one-member schemes should be considered as collective arrangements or institutions where retirement provisions are concerned.  They should be fully exempt and should not be affected in any way by IORP II.  A proportional approach should be taken for arrangements that have between one and 100 members.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2019110700002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. David Harney","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1573084800,"counter":1969,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Harney.
