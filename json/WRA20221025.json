This scheme will have a budget of approximately &euro;1.5 billion over the 2023-2027 period, equating to &euro;297 million per annum. It will encourage more than 120,000 farmers to deliver a range of farming practices that are beneficial to the climate and biodiversity.  <\/p>  <p>  Last week I announced the opening of applications for the new Agri-Climate Rural Environment Scheme (ACRES). This will have a budget of &euro;1.5 billion and will focus on supporting 50,000 farm families as well as enhacning our environment.<\/p>  <p>  The new Organic Farming Scheme also opened last week.

Irish beef is a far superior product produced by our world-class farmers.   <\/p>  <p>  Based on the concerns raised by Ireland and other EU countries, the European Commission and the European External Action Service are currently engaged with Mercosur countries on negotiating enforceable commitments on climate and deforestation.  <\/p>  <p>  When the final text of the Agreement is presented to EU countries for approval, the Government&rsquo;s position will be informed by its assessment of the additional enforcement provisions secured by the EU in the final text, as well as by the findings of the Economic and Sustainability Impact Assessment. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102500076#WRD00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1546"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Forestry Sector","counter":88,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102500076#WRD00800"},{"type":"question","counter":89,"qnumday":103,"qnumall":"[53239\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102500076#WRD00900","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the status of efforts to address the backlog in forestry licence issuance and meeting afforestation targets; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1604","askee":"1546"},{"type":"speech","counter":90,"content":"<p>I am very much pleased to advise that due to continued high output in forestry licencing this year, we have seen considerable reductions in the backlog of forestry licences. <\/p><p>The backlog has reduced from 6,000 in August 2021, to 3,700 in January of this year and now stands at 1,639. We are issuing more licences than applications received and this means that the backlog continues to drop, with faster turnaround times for new applicants.  <\/p><p>At the start of the year, we published a Forestry Licensing Plan for 2022 which contained a target of 5,250  licences, a year on year increase of 30%. <\/p><p>To 21st October 2022, we have issued 3,914 licences which is 92% of our expected output at this point in the year and there are currently 953 approved afforestation licences with just under 7,000 hectares ready for planting.<\/p><p>These improved outputs have achieved through a commitment to continuous improvement, as well as through the implementation of  measures recommended under Project Woodland. <\/p><p>Work is ongoing with the implementation of the 57 recommendations arising from a business process review carried out under Project Woodland, with 71% of the recommendations either complete or in progress.  <\/p><p>This builds on earlier improvements to our processes. They have facilitated the preparation of Appropriate Assessment Reports by the Department, which removes this burden from applicants in most cases.  <\/p><p>Furthermore, a pre-application discussion pilot has been completed and we now intend to deliver this at a national level, along with the new Forestry Programme.  All of these measures are aimed at improving the quality of applications received and optimising the time of those assessing applications.<\/p><p>Furthermore, in tandem with reviewing processes, I have substantially increased the resources available to process forestry licences, and the positive impact of this can be seen in the increased number of licences issuing. <\/p><p>In addition, a legal and regulatory review of forestry licensing was carried out by Philip Lee Solicitors and, following extensive stakeholder engagement, their Report was published in June.  <\/p><p>The Project Board for Project Woodland has responded to these recommendations and the Department will now finalise a plan for the implementation of the Report, with a certain number of actions already underway.<\/p><p>This improvement in licence output will remove one of the perceived barriers to planting. I am acutely aware of the afforestation target of 8,000 hectares per year set out in the Climate Action Plan and the fact that afforestation rates have been declining in recent years.  <\/p><p>As the Deputy may know, the current Forestry Programme provides supports for afforestation including grants and premiums and covers the cost of establishing a forest.  Despite strong support for landowners over a period of 15 years, we have not achieved the level of planting anticipated. We hope that a new Forestry Programme will re-engage landowners, farmers in particular, and realise the land-use change needed.<\/p><p>We are engaged in detailed discussions with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to agree funding.  We are also in contact with European Commission and are initiating the process for State Aid approval for the new Programme.<\/p><p>I intend to publish the financial supports for the new Programme at the earliest opportunity. <\/p><p>It is my intention to introduce a programme which will deliver for society, for landowners and for the forestry sector in Ireland. Its objective will be to expand the national forest estate on both private and public land.

Mackerel is managed on an annual\/seasonal basis with catch limits set based on allocation regimes developed over many years and related to historical catch records. Amendments to the mackerel policy in 2010 and 2017 were introduced following a full review and public consultation. It should be noted that the 2017 policy is subject to legal challenge in the Courts. <\/p>  <p>  Consultation on the management of quotas within National Policy is carried out each month at the Quota Management Advisory Committee (QMAC) meeting involving fishing industry representatives from the catching and processing sectors, the Department and the Sea Fisheries Protection Authority (SFPA). The QMAC examines in detail the operation of each fishery, available quota and uptake patterns for the different metiers of fishing vessels. Detailed discussions are held taking account of the situation of the fleet and the market. Any issues relating to the management of the Mackerel quota allocation to the relevant fisheries as set down in National Policy,  are discussed by the QMAC and recommendations are brought to my attention to inform my decision.<\/p>  <p>  As recommended by the QMAC, National Policy for Quota Balancing has been put in place to support the landing obligation for both demersal and pelagic stocks including Mackerel. Quota balancing, where a &lsquo;balancing adjustment&rsquo; is made from a future allocation of a fishing opportunity, is a conservation measure that aids industry in matching available quota to actual catch to support the effective operation of the landing obligation (discards ban).<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, in Ireland, fishing quotas, including the Mackerel quota, are a public resource. It is worth noting that within the EU, most quota systems have been privatised for their main commercial stocks. In Ireland, allocations are not owned by the vessel and when an allocation is not fished it is returned to the State for redistribution to the fleet. This  policy helps to support an Irish-owned and operated fleet with operations based in Ireland. If the fleet were not Irish owned, there would likely be a rapid concentration of ownership in a small number of international companies which are not likely to operate from Ireland and may not have any commercial links with Ireland. The result of this long-standing policy is that the Irish fishing fleet that have retained a strong economic link with our coastal communities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102500076#WRD02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1546"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Cost of Living Issues","counter":103,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102500076#WRD02300"},{"type":"question","counter":104,"qnumday":108,"qnumall":"[53084\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102500076#WRD02400","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the way that the allocations in Budget 2023 to his Department will help tackle the cost-of-living crisis; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1598","askee":"1546"},{"type":"speech","counter":105,"content":"<p>To help all families, individuals and businesses deal with the rising cost of living, the Government announced a package of once-off measures worth &euro;4.1bn as part of the overall &euro;11bn Budget 2023. <\/p>  <p>  Of particular assistance to the agri-food sector included the continuation of the reduction of excise duty on agricultural diesel to nil; the Temporary Business Energy Support Scheme, which will provide important support for farmers and food businesses with their energy bills; and the delivery of new loan schemes. <\/p>  <p>  In the Budget for 2023, I announced the highest-ever level of funding for my Department, a 13% increase overall, and I will continue to deliver the appropriate level of support, including working with my colleagues on business supports for farmers, fishers and food &amp;amp; drink businesses.<\/p>  <p>  Significant implications are being seen across all sectors, including the agri-food sector as a result of Russia's illegal invasion of Ukraine.

A transition period of three years for vessels over 18m targeting sprat was allowed to enable adjustment for these vessels, as the sprat fishery is concentrated inside the six nautical mile zone. <\/p>  <p>  A Policy Directive was issued by the Minister to the independent Licensing Authority to give effect to these measures. The Policy Directive directed the Licensing Authority to insert a condition to this effect into the licences of affected vessels. <\/p>  <p>  A Judicial Review to the High Court was taken by two applicant fishers challenging the validity of the Policy. On 6th October 2020, the Judge held in summary that the High Court&rsquo;s final order should be, among other matters, a declaration that Policy Directive 1 of 2019 was made in breach of fair procedures and is void and\/or of no legal effect. The breach of fair procedures as referenced above related to a failure with obligations to consult with the applicants in accordance with, and to the extent required by, the consultation process and in particular by failing to consult with them a second time once a preferred option had been identified. A stay on the order was refused by the High Court on 10th December 2020. <\/p>  <p>  I appealed the decision of the High Court to the Court of Appeal. I also sought a stay on the order of the High Court. The Court of Appeal reinstated the Ministerial Policy Directive on 19th March 2021, when the Court was persuaded that the balance of justice leaned in favour of the State and granted a stay on the order of the High Court up until the hearing of the substantive appeal in June. Following a full hearing by the Court of Appeal on 22nd June 2021, the Court decided to temporarily extend the Policy Directive excluding large vessels from trawling in inshore waters within 6 miles of the coast, save for a restricted sprat fishery. <\/p>  <p>  On September 23rd, 2021, the Court of Appeal refused my application to further continue the stay. This refusal means that the decision of the High Court stands and the Policy Directive is no longer valid, meaning vessels over 18 metres in length overall have resumed trawling in the waters inside 6 nautical miles. These vessels also no longer require an authorisation to fish for sprat inside 6 nautical miles. <\/p>  <p>  The Court of Appeal issued an unapproved judgment on 19th July last and my Department is at present considering the implications of the that unapproved judgment in consultation with its legal advisors.

Under the current EU regulations and under the new CAP Strategic Plan, it is not permitted for excess energy generated by grant-aided investments to be sold to the grid. Energy generated can only be consumed on the holding.<\/p>  <p>  The solar PV systems currently grant-aided under TAMS include Solar PV Panels and Solar PV Rechargeable Batteries and Solar Panels (Solar Thermal) for water heating under the Pig and Poultry Capital Investment Scheme.

To encourage further increased take-up in solar applications, I am proposing to make further changes to the scheme. This includes increasing the kilowatts for solar applications in TAMS 3 to 30 kilowatts from 11 kilowatts currently.

At that time, Ireland did not have a track record of commercial fishing for Bluefin Tuna and, accordingly, did not receive a quota allocation. <\/p>  <p>  The only way to obtain a share of the EU quota now would involve changing relative stability within the EU. This would require a majority of Member States to agree under the qualified majority voting system. This means that EU Member States with a national quota would have to give up a share of their allocation to Ireland. Member States with Bluefin Tuna Quota would strongly resist any loss of quota.  Any change to relative stability would involve a loss for some other Member States and therefore poses particular challenges in a qualified majority voting context. <\/p>  <p>  Bluefin Tuna is a highly migratory large pelagic species which spawns in the Mediterranean and then migrates over a wide area of the North-East Atlantic to feed. This migration brings some of the fish into the Irish 200 mile zone for part of the year. At the time we see fish in the Irish zone, there are also fish being caught in the international high seas and over a wide area from Spain to Norway.  There is no survey from which the abundance in Ireland's 200 mile zone may be determined. <\/p>  <p>  The CFP is reviewed every 10 years and the next review is scheduled to be completed by the end of this year when the European Commission will report to the European Parliament and the Council on the functioning of the CFP. Over the past year, I have consistently made clear the Irish Government&rsquo;s assessment that substantial changes brought about in fisheries policy, as a result of the adoption of the EU-UK Trade and Co-operation Agreement, require that internally within the EU a comprehensive review of the CFP be carried out that would support changes to deliver a fair and equitable policy.<\/p>  <p>  Earlier this year, I established a national Common Fisheries Policy Review group of relevant stakeholders to examine the issues that arise for Ireland in the context of the CFP Review, to advise me on priorities for the negotiations and to identify strategies most likely to influence the outcome of the review.  The Group was chaired by Mr. John Malone, former Secretary General of the Department of Agriculture, and assisted by a steering committee comprising Mr. Miche&aacute;l &Oacute; Cinneide, former Director of the MI and EPA and Mr. Donal Maguire, former Director in BIM. The Group involved representatives of key stakeholders, including industry representative groups and the environmental NGOs. The CFP Review Group submitted its final report to me on 29th July.  The stakeholders have set out a number of recommendations on aspects of the CFP which need to be addressed in order to adapt to the monumental changes of recent years and ensure a sustainable future for the sector.  <\/p>  <p>  I have forwarded a copy of the report to the EU Fisheries Commissioner, Virginijus Sinkevicius.

The legislation provides in section 653 I (Zoning Submissions) of Part 22A of the Tax Consolidation Act 1997 - inserted by section 80 of the Finance Act 2021 - an opportunity for landowners to request a variation of the zoning of their land prior to the commencement of the tax.

Growth outside of Dublin was particularly buoyant with 53%, that is 133 projects of the 249 investments won going to regional locations and employment growth was recorded in every region of the country. <\/p><p>IDA Ireland&rsquo;s Regional Property Programme is aimed at supporting economic development and job creation across IDA&rsquo;s, Enterprise Ireland and local LEO&rsquo;s respective client base. IDA Ireland operates a dynamic portfolio of strategic land banks as the availability of an adequate supply of marketable, serviced land and office\/industrial buildings is a key element in Ireland's ability to compete for mobile Foreign Direct Investment (FDI). Many of these sites are developed over years or decades, and their long-term value crystallises when a corporation converts them to a new facility. <\/p><p>The availability of property solutions eliminates the lead times normally associated with acquiring property, enables clients to plan their property needs with a greater degree of certainty and allows for the commencement of projects at an earlier date by eliminating much of the difficulties associated with land acquisition, planning and construction. It is, therefore, an important means by which the IDA can encourage and attract new investors to Ireland, particularly to the regions. <\/p><p>The Regional Property Programme has enabled the winning of capital-intensive projects of significant scale to regional locations over the past 5 years.  It is crucial that all parts of Ireland have a competitive, sustainable property offering to enable the attraction and retention of investment and jobs. IDA Ireland must therefore continue to have available sites and property on hand to remain competitive for FDI and to offer immediate availability for clients looking to invest.<\/p><p>The use of IDA Lands is restricted under legislation and any change to the use of the land would require ministerial consent \/ Government legislation.

Regular engagement and collaboration with stakeholders are important in positioning any regional location to attract FDI and in this respect IDA Ireland continues to engage with stakeholders in all regional locations to support jobs creation. <\/p><p>IDA also works closely with all relevant stakeholders to ensure that the sites are fit for purpose and the supporting infrastructure, including housing, is in place in the wider regional ecosystem to promote regional locations for investment.

It will apply to tax compliant businesses carrying out a trade or profession (Case I and Case II). It will also apply to new businesses. A monthly cap on relief of &euro;10,000 per trade or profession will apply. However, where a qualifying business operates across more than one location increased relief may be available subject to a monthly cap of &euro;30,000. The scheme will run from 1 September 2022 to 31 December 2022, with the intention to extend it to 28 February 2023 subject to the anticipated extension of the TCF.<\/p><p>In addition to this is a new Growth and Sustainability Loan Scheme, which will make up to &euro;500 million in low-cost investment loans of up to 10 years available to SMEs, with no collateral required for loans up to &euro;500,000. A minimum of 30% of the lending volume will be targeted towards Environmental Sustainability purposes.  <\/p><p>The reduced rate of VAT on gas and electricity from 13.5% to 9% has been extended until the 28th February 2023. <\/p><p>The Government are also raising awareness around energy efficiency, helping businesses reduce the amount of energy they use in the first place and improving take-up of the approximately 20 existing schemes that we already have in place for business to help them reduce their energy costs.

The agenda, driven by Forum Members, will continue to address issues impacting on the sector.<\/p><p>The Government will keep the energy situation under constant review and will continue to examine what measures are possible to manage the impact of rising energy prices. <\/p><p>In relation to introducing new rights for employees or strengthening existing provisions in the law, we have taken care to ensure that the measures are proportionate and balanced by reasonable defences for employers, recognising the challenges faced by employers in running their business.<\/p><p>From next year there will be a new permanent public holiday established in celebration of Imbolc\/St. Brigid&rsquo;s day.

The legislation grants rights to the creators (&ldquo;authors&rdquo;) of works to use, distribute and reproduce their work.  In addition, protection is afforded to performers, producers and broadcasters of works by what are known as &lsquo;related rights&rsquo;. The CRRA also ensures that rightholders have an effective means of enforcing their rights should they consider that they have been infringed.<\/p>  <p>  The legislation is complimented by a number of Statutory Instruments, most recently by the EU (Copyright and Related Rights in the Digital Single Market) Regulations 2021 (S.I. No. 567 of 2021) which transposes the EU Directive on Copyright in the Digital Single Market (EU) 2019\/790.  Considering the expansion of rights for rightholders provided by this transposition, whereby mandatory provisions of this significant EU Directive were implemented into Irish intellectual property law, I do not have plans to provide for further amendments at this time.<\/p>  <p>  The transposition of EU Directive 2019\/790 into national law strengthens the rights and protections of rightholders.

Regulation 27 provides for a transparency obligation meaning that a rightholder shall receive, from the party to whom the rightholder has transferred his or her rights, detailed information on how the work has been exploited. This provision ensures that authors and performers have access to an increased level of information about the exploitation of their works and performances which is necessary to allow rightsholders to adequately and continuously assess their economic value.<\/p>  <p>  Having obtained information, by way of the transparency obligations, Regulation 28 offers authors and performers a contract adjustment mechanism when &ldquo;the remuneration originally agreed turns out to be disproportionately low&rdquo; compared to the success of their work or performance and the resulting revenues generated.  In addition, when a rightsholder transfers their rights there is an expectation that their work or performance will be exploited. In the event that this does not occur, Regulation 29 will allow for the revocation of rights thus allowing rightsholders to transfer or license their rights to another person.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102500079#WRG01800","answer":true,"speaker":"1505"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Enterprise Support Services","counter":277,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102500079#WRG01900"},{"type":"question","counter":278,"qnumday":167,"qnumall":"[53554\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102500079#WRG02000","dept":"Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment","minister":"Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment","question":"if he will detail the total training budget allocated in 2021 to the 31 local enterprise offices for their local training initiatives for businesses, including training such as digital marketing, lean, mentoring and starting one&rsquo;s own business; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1480","askee":"1474"},{"type":"speech","counter":279,"content":"<p>The Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs) are allocated a Training and Development budget to provide a wide range of high-quality entrepreneurial capability training and development programmes.

I am advised by National Broadband Ireland (NBI) that, as of 14 October 2022, over 97,000 premises can order or pre-order a high-speed broadband connection across 25 counties, with over 87,700 premises passed across 25 counties and available for immediate connection. Construction is underway across 26 counties demonstrating that the project is reaching scale. To date, the level of connections is increasing on a daily basis and is in line with or exceeding expectations.

As you are aware, a draft national charging infrastructure strategy for the development of EV charging infrastructure, covering the crucial period out to 2025 was published for consultation in March. The draft strategy sets out the government&rsquo;s ambition regarding the delivery of a public EV charging network to support up to 195,000 electric cars and vans by the middle of the decade. Responses and submissions received as part of the consultation are currently being considered in the development of the final Strategy for publication later this year.<\/p><p>Home charging is the primary charging method for most Irish EV owners as it&rsquo;s convenient and cheaper for the consumer as well as assisting in the overall management of the national grid. Over 80% of charging is expected to happen at home.<\/p><p>However, there is also a need for a seamless public charging network that will provide for situations or instances where home charging is not possible, such as on-street and residential charging, destination charging and workplace charging. <\/p><p>On 21st July I launched a new dedicated Office, Zero Emission Vehicles Ireland, which will oversee and accelerate Ireland&rsquo;s transition to zero emission vehicles. A suite of new grants and initiatives have been launched including the Apartment Charging Grant. This grant is for dwellings which do not have access to a driveway such as apartments, duplexes and mixed developments. Management companies can now apply for up to 80% funding for infrastructure costs when installing an EV charging system in multi unit residences. <\/p><p>ZEVI is also in the process of developing new residential charging grant which will focus on providing neighbourhood and residential charging solutions, targeting areas where off-street charging is either limited or not possible. <\/p><p>The launch of this scheme is planned to take place in 2023. <\/p><p>Additionally, &euro;10 million has been committed from the Climate Action Fund to support ESB investment in the publicly accessible charging network and this has leveraged a further &euro;10 million investment from ESB, with the infrastructure to be in place by the end of 2022. <\/p><p>In terms of progress ESB eCars have:<\/p><p>- One hub of 4 High-Powered Chargers with 8 charging bays constructed, with 2 in progress.

A further reduction of 1 cent per litre (VAT inclusive) applied from 1 April 2022 to offset the impact of anticipated increased prices as a result of the increase in the Biofuel Obligation Scheme administered by Minister for Transport and Environment, Climate and Communications. These reductions were due to expire on 12 October 2022 but in recognition of continuing elevated costs these measures were extended out in Budget 2023 to 28 February 2023.<\/p><p>- On 15 March 2022, the Government introduced the <b>Licensed Haulage Emergency Support Scheme<\/b>. The Scheme was administered by the Department of Transport and provided a temporary financial support of &euro;100 per week, for eight weeks, for each eligible heavy goods vehicle authorised on the licence of a road haulage operator as of 11 March 2022. There was good uptake of the scheme, with over &euro;15.6 million paid out to 3,080 operators (approx. 80% of licensed operators.). <\/p><p>- The <b>Revenue Diesel Rebate Scheme (&lsquo;DRS&rsquo;)<\/b>has been in place since 2013 and remains available to licensed haulage operators in respect of vehicles over 7.5 tonnes. At diesel prices over &euro;1.43 (including VAT), the maximum rebate of 7.5 cent per litre is provided. Data from the Revenue Commissioners shows that not all licensed operators currently avail of this support &ndash; I would encourage all eligible operators to do so.<\/p><p>The rising cost of fuel has been further recognised by the Government through the <b>reduction of the National Oil Reserves Agency (NORA) Levy <\/b>to &euro;0.001. The reduction of the NORA levy, which had been collected at a rate of 2 cent per litre, will help offset the carbon tax increase of just over 2 cent which took effect on 12 October, meaning that the price of fuel will not go up as a result of taxes or levies.<\/p><p>The causes of the current fuel price pressures are not within the control of Government and are being directly influenced by external factors, including the Ukraine crisis. Unfortunately, it isn&rsquo;t possible to fully insulate citizens and businesses from the impact of these fuel price increases. <\/p><p>With the benefit of the Excise reduction, the 8 weeks support under the Licensed Haulage Support Scheme and the ongoing Diesel Rebate relief and NORA levy reduction, haulage businesses have had the opportunity to revise and renegotiate contracts with their clients in order to reflect increased prices, as is an unfortunate reality in all sectors across the economy. It is important that all businesses, large and small, across the economy share the pain of these cost increases - where it is possible to review contractual arrangements to provide for such sharing in these difficult times, I would encourage all businesses to adopt a fair and reasonable approach.<\/p><p>We will continue to monitor the evolution of fuel prices in the period ahead and we will remain engaged on an ongoing basis with the sectoral representative bodies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102500081#WRJ06100","answer":true,"speaker":"1578"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Transport Infrastructure Ireland","counter":470,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102500082#WRK00200"},{"type":"question","counter":471,"qnumday":233,"qnumall":"[53374\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102500082#WRK00300","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"if he will consider an alternative option for sending the W62 route from Tallaght to Newcastle on to Adamstown train station via the Peamount road and Newcastle road, in order to link the community of Newcastle to the trail line which is the objective of the original W6, in the context of the full W6 route not being operational until major works are done at Hazelhatch bridge.","asker":"1566","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":472,"content":"<p>As Minister for Transport, I have responsibility for policy and overall funding in relation to public transport.

Until the changes I brought in as part of the Finance Act 2019, Ireland&rsquo;s vehicle benefit-in-kind regime was unusual in that there was no overall CO2 rationale in the regime. This is despite a CO2 based vehicle BIK regime being legislated for as far back as 2008 (but never having been commenced).<\/p>  <p>  In Finance Act 2019, I legislated for a CO2-based BIK regime for company cars from 1 January 2023. From that date the amount taxable as BIK remains determined by the car&rsquo;s original market value (OMV) and the annual business kilometres driven, while new CO2 emissions-based bands will determine whether a standard, discounted, or surcharged rate is taxable. The number of mileage bands is reduced from five to four. Detailed information on the taxation of employer-provided vehicles is included in Tax and Duty Manual Part 05-01-01b, which is available on the Revenue website. <\/p>  <p>  EVs will benefit from a preferential rate of BIK, ranging from 9 &ndash; 22.5% depending on mileage. Fossil-fuel vehicles will be subject to higher BIK rates, up to 37.5%. This new structure with CO2-based discounts and surcharges is designed to incentivise employers to provide employees with low-emission cars. <\/p>  <p>  I am aware there have been arguments surrounding the mileage bands in the new BIK structure as they can be perceived as incentivising higher mileage to avail of lower rates, leading to higher levels of emissions. The rationale behind the mileage bands is that the greater the business mileage, the more the car is a benefit to the company rather than its employee (on average); and the more the car depreciates in value, the less of a benefit it is to the employee (in years 2 and 3) as the asset from which the benefit is derived is depreciating faster. Mileage bands also ensure that cars more integral to the conduct of business receive preferential tax treatment.<\/p>  <p>  I believe that better value for money for the taxpayer is achieved by curtailing the amount of subsidies available and building an environmental rationale directly into the BIK regime. It was determined in this context that reforming the BIK system to include emissions bands provides for a more sustainable environmental rationale than the continuation of the current system with exemptions for electric vehicles (EVs).  This will bring the taxation system around company cars into step with other CO2-based motor taxes as well as the long-established CO2-based vehicle BIK regimes in other member states. With significant Government commitments to decarbonise road transport, including a specific Climate Action Plan action to reform company car taxation, by 2023 an emissions-based rationale for vehicle BIK is overdue.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to the comparison between the  BIK calculation for employer provided vehicles with the calculation of Remote Working Relief, the Deputy should note that it is difficult to make such a comparison as the two regimes are dealing with different things. The legislation governing the provision of an employer provided car regards it as a benefit to an employee and is taxable as notional income, whereas Remote Working Relief legislation, contained in section 114A TCA 1997, seeks to provide a measure of relief to employees who incur certain expenditure while working from home.  It should be pointed out that where an employer makes good any expenditure incurred by an employee, this amount reduces the employee&rsquo;s Remote Working Relief claim. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102500082#WRK05300","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Data","counter":522,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102500082#WRK05400"},{"type":"question","counter":523,"qnumday":251,"qnumall":"[53038\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102500082#WRK05500","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the amount raised by each local authority since the introduction of the local property tax, by year, amount eligible to raise before local-adjustment factor and amount raised in tabular form.","asker":"1570","askee":"1558"},{"type":"question","counter":524,"qnumday":252,"qnumall":"[53039\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102500082#WRK05600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the amount of money raised by the local property tax each year since its introduction by local authority in tabular form.","asker":"1570","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":525,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 251 and 252 together.<\/p><p>I am advised by Revenue that the amount of money collected for the years 2016 and beyond is published on the Revenue website at .

The introduction of this levy arises from a Government decision that a levy be imposed on the construction sector to contribute towards the cost of the Mica Redress Scheme, that was taken in November 2021.<\/p><p>Following the announcement of the levy on Budget day, and in light of subsequent feedback from industry participants and others, I have determined that the rate at which the levy will apply will now be set at 5%. It will also now come into effect on 1 September 2023, to allow more time for all stakeholders to prepare for its introduction.<\/p><p>I have also decided to remove pre-cast concrete products from the scope of the levy, so that it will now only apply to pouring concrete (aka ready-mix) and concrete blocks under two harmonised EU standards.

A key condition is that the total area of land under lease and on which solar panels are installed does not exceed 50% of the total area of agricultural land.  <\/p>  <p>  While introducing this amendment, it was important that we did not lose sight of the fundamental principle which underpins our policy in relation to agricultural relief and retirement relief.  <\/p>  <p>  I recognise that allowing land leased for solar panels to be classified as qualifying agricultural property is an important element in encouraging solar energy projects.

Until the changes I brought in as part of the Finance Act 2019, Ireland&rsquo;s vehicle benefit-in-kind regime was unusual in that there was no overall CO2 rationale in the regime. This is despite a CO2 based vehicle BIK regime being legislated for as far back as 2008 (but never having been commenced).<\/p>  <p>  In Finance Act 2019, I legislated for a CO2-based BIK regime for company cars from 1 January 2023. From that date the amount taxable as BIK remains determined by the car&rsquo;s original market value (OMV) and the annual business kilometres driven, while new CO2 emissions-based bands will determine whether a standard, discounted, or surcharged rate is taxable. The number of mileage bands is reduced from five to four. Detailed information on the taxation of employer-provided vehicles is included in Tax and Duty Manual Part 05-01-01b, which is available on the Revenue website. <\/p>  <p>  EVs will benefit from a preferential rate of BIK, ranging from 9 &ndash; 22.5% depending on mileage. Fossil-fuel vehicles will be subject to higher BIK rates, up to 37.5%. This new structure with CO2-based discounts and surcharges will incentivise employers to provide employees with low-emission cars. <\/p>  <p>  I am aware that there have been arguments surrounding the mileage bands in the new BIK structure as they can be perceived as incentivising higher mileage to avail of lower rates, leading to higher levels of emissions. However the rationale behind the mileage bands is that the greater the business mileage, the more the car is a benefit to the company rather than its employee (on average); and the more the car depreciates in value, the less of a benefit it is to the employee (in years 2 and 3) as the asset from which the benefit is derived is depreciating faster. Mileage bands also ensure that cars more integral to the conduct of business receive preferential tax treatment.<\/p>  <p>  I believe that better value for money for the taxpayer is achieved by curtailing the amount of subsidies available and building an environmental rationale directly into the BIK regime. It was determined in this context that reforming the BIK system to include emissions bands provides for a more sustainable environmental rationale than the continuation of the current system with exemptions for electric vehicles (EVs).  This will bring the taxation system around company cars into step with other CO2-based motor taxes as well as the long-established CO2-based vehicle BIK regimes in other member states.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to the above and  in light of government commitments on climate change, Budget 2022 extended the preferential BIK treatment for EVs to end 2025 with a tapering mechanism on the vehicle value threshold. This BIK00, low motor tax of &euro;120 per annum, SEAI grants, discounted tolls fees, and 0% BIK on electric charging. <\/p>  <p>  Finally, it should be noted that this new BIK exemption forms part of a broader series of very generous measures to support the uptake of EVs, including a reduced rate of 7% VRT, a VRT relief of up to &euro;5,0 charging mechanism was legislated for in 2019 and was announced as part of Budget 2020. I am satisfied that this has provided a sufficient lead in time to adapt to this new system before its implementation in 2023. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102500083#WRL01700","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"question","counter":545,"qnumday":259,"qnumall":"[53272\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102500083#WRL01900","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"his views on extending the tax credits for renters to include persons renting social housing and meet the financial threshold.","asker":"1525","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":546,"content":"<p>On Budget Day, I announced a &euro;500 Rent Tax Credit which it is proposed will be claimable in respect of rent paid in 2022 and subsequent years to end-2025<\/p><p>The intention is that, in order for a person to be in a position to claim the credit in a year:<\/p><p>- the rent paid must be in respect of the person&rsquo;s principal private residence;<\/p><p>- the person living in the rented property themselves, or their spouse\/civil partner, must have paid sufficient rent and sufficient income tax to avail of the credit;<\/p><p>- the tenancy must be registered with the Residential Tenancies Board (RTB), but only where this is already a legal requirement.<\/p><p>In the context of a person who is single fully utilising the &euro;500 tax credit, &quot;sufficient rent&quot; amounts to &euro;2,500 in a year.

The income tax scheme allowed investors in a qualifying Irish film to claim an income tax relief on their investment, once the film had been certified by Revenue and filming had commenced. In general, this was claimed by individuals against the higher income tax rate (which was either at 40% or 41% during the time this scheme operated).<\/p>  <p>  From January 2015 the scheme was amended to provide relief to production companies as a credit against corporation tax. From 2015 to March 2019 the producer company applied to Revenue with a comprehensive set of information supporting the filming, post-production and financial plan for the film for certification under section 481. Revenue extracted the cultural and employment aspects of the application and forwarded same to the then Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht for consideration. Once an authorisation was received from the Department, Revenue would scrutinise in detail the budgets and other financial aspects of the proposed claim to confirm the expected value of film tax credit and issue a certificate to this effect.  The credit could be claimed by the company in one of two ways.  Firstly, in two installments with an upfront claim of 90% of the expected credit based on budgeted expenditure during the production of the film, followed by a balancing payment on completion of the film based on actual spend.  Alternatively, once certified, the production company could wait and claim the credit in one payment after completion of the film on submission of the compliance report.<\/p>  <p>  As part of this 2015-2019 claiming mechanism, Revenue examined applications based on budgeted expenditure to certify the value of the initial 90% that could be claimed up-front. Upon completion of the film and receipt of the compliance report, Revenue conducted another full examination of the actual expenditure incurred before certifying the balancing 10% of the claim. This process meant that Revenue adjusted the value of the claim where it was incorrect. In this manner Revenue verified that the amount claimed was correct. Therefore there was no incorrect amount claimed to which interest and penalties could apply. <\/p>  <p>  The relief was amended through Finance Act 2018.  Applications for section 481 relief are now sent directly to the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sports and Media (DTCAGSM), who are responsible for certifying that the film is a qualifying film for the purpose of the credit. An application for certification must be made in writing to the Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media at least 21 working days prior to the commencement of the Irish production. If DTCAGSM are satisfied that the application meets the cultural and industry development requirements set out in the Regulations, the film will be issued with a certificate to be treated as a qualifying film.<\/p>  <p>  Should a production be certified by the Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media, a producer company may claim the film corporation tax credit on a self-assessment basis through its corporation tax return (Form CT1), provided it has met all the other procedural and financial requirements of the relief.  The producer company is required to have extensive documentation available to support the value of the claim. This documentation is set out in Schedules 2-5 of the Film Regulations 2019. <\/p>  <p>  There are two options available to claimants when claiming the credit. A claimant may claim 100% of the credit based on actual expenditure. This claim must be made within 6 months of completion of the production.  Alternatively a claim can be made during the course of the production. In this scenario the claim is made in two instalments. The first part of the claim may be made for 90% of the credit based on budgeted expenditure. The balance of the claim is calculated based on actual expenditure, and must be claimed within 6 months of completion.  As the relief is now claimed on a self-assessment basis, any claim may be subject to review in future in accordance with Revenue&rsquo;s Code of Practice for Revenue Audit and Other Compliance Interventions.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to the Deputy&rsquo;s request for detailed project-level data, I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the tax affairs of individual taxpayers cannot be disclosed due to the obligation to protect taxpayer confidentiality as provided for by section 851A of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997. Section 851A(8A) only permits Revenue to disclose specific taxpayer information in relation to recipients of section 481 film tax credit in line with requirements under the European Cinema Communication C332\/01.

The pre-population of information in the online return is provided to assist taxpayers in easily identifying the relevant parts of the form for completion based on the previous year, particularly if their circumstances and sources of income remain unchanged. <\/p><p>While the online Form 11 provides an indicative calculation of the tax, USC and PRSI due based on the information entered by the taxpayer which can be used to complete the &lsquo;Self-Assessment&rsquo; panel of the Form 11 to meet his or her legal requirement to self-assess, it cannot calculate figures for preliminary tax as a taxpayer&rsquo;s circumstances can change from year to year.<\/p><p>Revenue provides significant support to taxpayers when completing their Form 11 each year including a range of guidance material on the Revenue website, an annual <i>Guide to Completing the Form 11<\/i>, and a specific Tax and Duty Manual highlighting any changes each year, in addition to guidance within the online form itself.  Revenue also frequently asks self-assessed taxpayers to review their circumstances and consider if they should continue to be self-assessed.  This is particularly relevant for those taxpayers who were self-employed and trading but are in receipt of pension income only since the previous tax year.  It is possible that those taxpayers no longer need to file a Form 11 and could instead file the shorter income tax return for PAYE (or pension only) taxpayers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102500083#WRL03200","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Reliefs","counter":559,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102500083#WRL03300"},{"type":"question","counter":560,"qnumday":264,"qnumall":"[53572\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102500083#WRL03400","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the amount of tax revenue foregone through tax reliefs related to airplane leasing by income tax, corporation tax, capital gains tax, value added tax, gift and inheritance tax, stamp duty and other relevant tax relief in each of the years 2010 to 2019 and to date in 2022, in tabular form; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1468","askee":"1558"},{"type":"question","counter":561,"qnumday":265,"qnumall":"[53573\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102500083#WRL03500","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if the analysis and reasoning behind the tax reliefs in the aviation leasing sector will be provided; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1468","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":562,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 264 and 265 together.<\/p>  <p>Within the tax code there are various generally available tax reliefs that may be claimed by aircraft leasing companies but are not specifically for use by these companies.  Statistics in relation to tax costs for various reliefs are available on the Revenue website at: www.revenue.ie\/en\/corporate\/information-about-revenue\/statistics\/tax-expenditures\/costs-expenditures.aspx.<\/p>  <p>  There are also some provisions in the Energy Tax and VAT Directives that are of relevance to the aviation sector.  <\/p>  <p>  I am advised by Revenue that the following provisions are of particular relevance to the aviation leasing sector:<\/p>  <p>  1. Special Assignee Relief Programme (&ldquo;SARP&rdquo;):<\/p>  <p>  SARP seeks to facilitate further investment by multinationals, including international lessors, in Irish operations by reducing the costs to these businesses of attracting key employees from overseas to work in either the Irish-based operations of their employer or an associated company.<\/p>  <p>  Relief is given by way of disregarding 30 per cent of an assignee&rsquo;s employment income between &euro;75,000 and &euro;1 million for Income Tax purposes for up to 5 years. The relief also allows for certain schooling and travel expenses to be exempted from the charge to tax in that period where certain conditions apply. SARP does not affect an individual&rsquo;s USC or PRSI obligations.<\/p>  <p>  Individuals in receipt of SARP will often remain part of the social security system of their home country while on assignment. As such, PRSI may not apply to such individuals. <\/p>  <p>The overall cost and number of claimants of this relief is available in the annual SARP reports available on the Revenue website at www.revenue.ie\/en\/corporate\/information-about-revenue\/research\/statistical-reports\/special-assignee-relief-programme.aspx. Table 8 of the 2020 SARP report provides a breakdown of claimants by employer sector, with the aircraft leasing sector included within the heading &lsquo;Administrative and support service activities&rsquo;, however additional claimants may be captured under the heading &lsquo;Financial and Insurance Activities&rsquo; where the leasing company is a qualifying company for the purposes of Section 110 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997. This heading may also capture other companies involved in management or other activities related to aircraft leasing. I am advised by Revenue that a further breakdown of claimants specifically employed in the aircraft leasing sector only is not available.<\/p>  <p>  2. Capital Allowances<\/p>  <p>  Companies which hold equipment, plant &amp;amp; machinery assets, including lessors, are generally entitled to claim capital allowances in lieu of accounting depreciation. Capital allowances are typically given over an 8-year life irrespective of the life of the asset in respect of which they are granted.<\/p>  <p>  Aircraft are high value items that can have a life of 20 or more years. As such, in the first 8 years of ownership of an asset aircraft leasing companies are often in a position where the available capital allowances are in excess of the income earning profile of the asset, resulting in losses in the first 8 years of leasing trades. Such allowances may be subject to clawback provisions when the capital asset is sold or otherwise disposed of and, to mitigate the impact on the Exchequer, excess leasing capital allowances are ring-fenced such that they can only be used against the lease rental income of the company or group.<\/p>  <p>  While a breakdown by sector of these tax costs is not separately available, Revenue&rsquo;s annual Corporation Tax research paper details claims in respect of losses and capital allowances by sector as reported in annual Corporation Tax returns. This is available on pages 14 and 16 of the paper, which is available on the Revenue website at: www.revenue.ie\/en\/corporate\/documents\/research\/ct-analysis-2022.pdf. <\/p>  <p>  The aircraft leasing sector is included within the heading &lsquo;Administrative and support service activities&rsquo; and is responsible for the majority of the claims shown on these pages for this sector. Additional claimants may be captured under the heading &lsquo;Financial and Insurance Activities&rsquo; where the leasing company is a qualifying company for the purposes of Section 110 TCA 1997. This heading may also capture other companies involved in management or other activities adjacent to aircraft leasing. <\/p>  <p>  3. Stamp Duty<\/p>  <p>  Relief is available from stamp duty under section 113 of the Stamp Duties Consolidation Act (SDCA) 1999 on instruments for:<\/p>  <p>  - the sale or transfer of any ship, vessel or aircraft or <\/p>  <p>  - any part, interest, share or property of or in any ship, vessel or aircraft.<\/p>  <p>  This relief was introduced in 2013 to provide clarity for investors, although stamp duty was generally  not chargeable on such transactions.<\/p>  <p>  4. 4.Interest limitation<\/p>  <p>  Interest limitation rules were introduced in Finance Act 2021 and seek to limit base erosion through the use of interest expenses that create excessive interest deductions which are disproportionate to the level of interest income earned by the company. <\/p>  <p>  Provision is made in these rules to recognise the role leasing companies have in effectively providing financing for airlines who may otherwise be unable to acquire aircraft. As such, lease income amounts that are deemed to be interest income for accounting purposes are treated as interest income for the purposes of the interest limitation rules.  <\/p>  <p>  As interest limitation rules only commenced from 1 January this year, no data is currently available on the impact of this provision.<\/p>  <p>  5. Excise duty treatment of aviation fuel<\/p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s excise duty treatment of fuel used for air navigation is governed by European Union law as set out in Directive 2003\/96\/EC on the taxation of energy products and electricity, commonly known as the Energy Tax Directive (ETD). <\/p>  <p>  Jet fuel, or heavy oil, used for commercial air navigation (including leased aircraft) is fully exempt from Motor Oil Tax (MOT). No such exemption applies to jet fuel used for private pleasure flying (non-commercial air navigation) and an MOT rate of &euro;425.45 per 1,000 litres applies. <\/p>  <p>  Aviation gasoline (light oil) used for commercial air navigation is partially exempt from MOT and an effective rate of &euro;251.07 applies. The full MOT rate of &euro;483.34 applies to aviation gasoline used for private pleasure flying.<\/p>  <p>  I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that data in respect of this measure, with regard to companies in the aviation leasing sector, is not readily available.<\/p>  <p>  6. Although not a relief, it is noted for completeness that Article 148 of the VAT Directive states that Member States shall exempt the supply of goods for the fuelling and provisioning of aircraft used by airlines operating for reward chiefly on international routes as well as the supply, modification, repair, maintenance, chartering and hiring of those aircraft. VAT in the EU is governed by the VAT Directive with which Irish legislation must comply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102500083#WRL03600","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":563,"content":"<p>Question No. 265 answered with Question No. 264.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","counter":565,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102500083#WRL03900"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"National Development Plan","counter":564,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102500083#WRL03800"},{"type":"question","counter":565,"qnumday":266,"qnumall":"[52691\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102500083#WRL03900","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the projects that have been removed from the priority list under the national development plan.","asker":"1514","askee":"1459"},{"type":"speech","counter":566,"content":"<p>The National Development Plan 2021-30 (NDP) published last year provides a detailed and positive vision for Ireland until the end of the decade, and sees total public investment of &euro;165 billion over that period. It is important to note that the NDP is fundamentally a high-level financial and budgetary plan, which sets out the framework and broad direction for investment priorities. It includes Exchequer allocations for Departments for the period 2021-2025 to support the delivery of the ten National Strategic Outcomes identified in the National Planning Framework (NPF). In Budget 2023 last month, I announced an additional &euro;800 million which will be made available under the NDP for core capital spending to help in delivering the largest, greenest and most ambitious infrastructure plan in the history of the State. With capital underspends from this year, the amount available next year will be well over &euro;12 billion. This represents a very substantial commitment of resources. The Government remains determined to effectively delivering the NDP projects and ensure that they are timely and crucially, that they provide value for money.<\/p>  <p>  The NDP is not a comprehensive list of all the public investment projects that will take place over its lifetime. However, where sufficient planning and evaluation has already taken place the NDP contains expenditure commitments for a range of strategic investment priorities which have been determined by the relevant Departments as central to the delivery of the NPF vision. All of these commitments require evaluation along with the development of business cases in line with the requirements of the Public Spending Code before they are formally approved for implementation.<\/p>  <p>  It should be noted that my Department, in carrying out its role in terms of oversight of the NDP, does not consider the merits of individual projects or sectoral policy strategies as this is primarily a matter for individual Departments and Agencies.<\/p>  <p>  Individual projects are generally selected by Departments or Agencies based on a detailed process which begins with setting their own sectoral strategy and goals, and then subsequently identifying specific needs or challenges to be addressed, whether that be through regulation, taxation, education or potentially expenditure on an investment project.

If no State requirement is identified or if a decision is taken not to dispose of a particular property, the OPW may consider community involvement (subject to detailed written submission, which would indicate that the community\/voluntary group has the means to insure, maintain and manage the property and that there are no ongoing costs for the Exchequer).<\/p><p>When a property is deemed surplus to the requirements of the Commissioners, the OPW notifies all relevant stakeholders as part of the disposal policy.  This includes notifying the Land Development Agency and the relevant local authorities who may be interested in acquiring the property for housing purposes. While the provision of social\/affordable and emergency residential accommodation is a function of the Local Authorities and the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, the OPW has in recent years provided:<\/p><p>- eight residential units in Dublin City Centre that were transferred to Dublin City Council for use by the Peter McVerry Trust.<\/p><p>- A building in Crumlin, Dublin that is now licensed to Dublin City Council for use as a Family Hub.<\/p><p>- The former Central Mental Hospital, Dundrum which will be transferring to the Land Development Agency for housing purposes.<\/p><p>- A further seven buildings are being transferred to Cork County Council for social housing and a site in Cork is transferring to Cork County Council for the construction of 24 social housing units.<\/p><p>Buildings owned or managed by the OPW are primarily commercial offices, Garda stations, warehouses or others that are not suited to residential use. However, the OPW has actively engaged with the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government in providing information on any non-operational, vacant buildings owned.  The Department then assesses those buildings in terms of what might be suitable for residential use. <\/p><p>In the case of the limited number of vacant Garda Stations, the OPW has notified all the relevant Local Authorities that these are vacant and available for transfer.  The Commissioners have also similarly informed the Department of Housing of such availability on a number of occasions.  To-date, the OPW has transferred five former station properties to Local Authorities with ten former Garda stations in the process of being transferred.  In addition, the OPW is in the process of leasing three former Garda stations to Local Authorities for community use.<\/p><p>The OPW has also engaged with the Land Development Agency on any suitable land in our ownership, as well as the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth in relation to housing persons arriving in Ireland as a result of the war in Ukraine.<\/p><p>Where either the local authorities or other State bodies do not want the properties in question they are prepared for sale through public auction.<\/p><p>Valuations are available when the properties and sites are valued either by the appointed auctioneer, (if proceeding to auction), or by the Valuation Office, (if proceeding by intra State transfer).<\/p><p>A list of the current vacant properties (buildings and sites), with an indication of their status and future plans, is attached at Schedule A.<\/p><p>The Office of Public Works does not have any leased buildings that are fully vacant at this time.  <\/p><p>The OPW is not in a position to provide data on any leased buildings that may be held by other State bodies where those bodies have entered into an agreement directly with a landlord.<\/p><p><ahref=\"https:\/\/data.oireachtas.ie\/ie\/oireachtas\/debates\/questions\/supportingDocumentation\/2022-10-25_pq271-25-10-2022_en.docx \">List of Vacant Properties<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102500083#WRL05600","answer":true,"speaker":"1494"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":583,"content":"<p>Question No. 272 answered with Question No. 271.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Education and Training Boards","counter":585,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102500084#WRM00200"},{"type":"question","counter":586,"qnumday":273,"qnumall":"[52909\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102500084#WRM00300","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":" in view of the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science's reply to Parliamentary Question 140 of 18 October 2022, if he will provide an update on the progress of the joint proposal from officials in the Department for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, and officials in the Department of Education, aimed at resolving outstanding issues in regard to employment contracts and conditions for adult education tutors employed by ETBs and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1605","askee":"1459"},{"type":"speech","counter":587,"content":"<p>The terms and conditions of Adult Education Tutors employed by Education and Training Boards are a matter in the first instance for both the Department of Education and the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science.

With regard to  expenditure on National Lottery Advertising, under the terms of the Licence to operate the National Lottery, the Operator is required to promote the  National Lottery in two respects.<\/p><p>A. Base Marketing<\/p><p>The operator is required to undertake &ldquo;base marketing&rdquo; that is &ldquo;fundamental to the promotion and operation of the National Lottery in the ordinary course&rdquo;. Some of this expenditure goes on advertising. Base marketing expenditure must be funded entirely by the Operator.<\/p><p>B. Incremental Marketing<\/p><p>&ldquo;Incremental marketing&rdquo; is all marketing other than base marketing. Some of this expenditure goes on advertising. Incremental marketing expenditure can be funded by expired unclaimed prizes and\/or by the Operator. The Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s Report on the Accounts of the Public Services 2021 reported that, in accordance with the terms of the Licence, &euro;122 million in unclaimed prizes has been forfeited to the National Lottery operator to date and spent on promoting the National Lottery. The total figure of &euro;122 million correctly reflects the annual figures previously released by the Office of the Regulator of the National Lottery. The amount of expired unclaimed prizes in each of 2020 and 2021 was &euro;17 million.<\/p><p><i>Advertising and Promotion Code of Practice<\/i><\/p><p>Clause 9 of the Licence provides for an Advertising and Promotion Code of Practice (&ldquo;the Code&rdquo;) giving the Operator clear guidelines to ensure responsible marketing communication and advertising practices consistent with the laws on advertising in the State. The Code must be reviewed annually by the Operator and any changes must be approved for use by the Regulator, and this has been completed in each year to date. <\/p><p>The Regulator of the National Lottery regularly monitors the Operator&rsquo;s marketing communication channels to ensure that it follows responsible advertising and gaming practices as per the Code and other clauses of the Licence. The information provided must be transparent, accessible, and not misleading. Players should not intentionally or unintentionally be exposed to communications likely to result in underage or irresponsible play. For example, social media advertising and promotion must be designed to reach only those who are 21+ . <\/p><p><i>Responsible Gaming \/ Protection of Players<\/i><\/p><p>A statutory objective of the Regulator is that the interests of the participants in the National Lottery are protected. Included in this objective is monitoring how the Operator is protecting players at risk of excessive or problem play. While many people enjoy and engage safely in National Lottery activity, certain groups or individuals can be vulnerable or susceptible to problem play. The Regulator continuously researches and identifies processes and practices that have demonstrated effectiveness in preventing or minimising risk of harm. Safety factors already built into the National Lottery to achieve this objective include: <\/p><p>1.National Lottery ticket machines only operate between the hours of 7am and 11pm.<\/p><p>2.The types of games that the National Lottery may sell are strictly limited.<\/p><p>3.Every new game or change to an existing game must be pre-approved by the Regulator. <\/p><p>4.Each new game or change to an existing game is considered by the Regulator with regard to the risk of addiction or problem play.<\/p><p>5.Retailers and the operator&rsquo;s customer service staff are trained in the warning signs of addition and problem play.<\/p><p>6.Rules to ensure that the advertising and promotion of the National Lottery is appropriate for the nature of the product are in place and enforced by the Regulator.<\/p><p>7.Direct marketing and upselling are prohibited except where a player has opted in to receiving marketing messages or the Regulator approves of a direct marketing campaign (which has not been the case to date).<\/p><p>8.The National Lottery websites and tickets provide links to information on problem gambling and relevant resources.<\/p><p>In retail specifically:<\/p><p>1.Mystery shop exercises are regularly conducted to ensure that retailers are complying with the requirement not to sell a ticket to a person under 18 years of age and the Think 21 requirement to ask for proof of age.

It is located between Halston Street and Green Street close to Smithfield Market with its entrance on Halston Street. It was originally known as the Sherriff&rsquo;s Prison and ceased to function as a prison in the mid-nineteenth century.  It was used as a cholera hospital for a short period of time.<\/p>  <p>  In 1867, the Debtors&rsquo; Prison was transferred to the Commissioners of Public Works in Ireland (CPW) and converted into a barracks for the Dublin Metropolitan Police, and subsequently became a Garda Station.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na vacated the property in 1962; and in 1963 it was handed back to the CPW for the use of the Office of Public Works (OPW).<\/p>  <p>  The Debtors&rsquo; Prison was licenced to Dublin Corporation for emergency housing and was used by the Corporation for housing until it terminated the arrangement in 1987.<\/p>  <p>  In 1992, the Commissioners granted a 99-year lease to the Green Street Trust.  The aim of the Trust was to promote urban renewal in disadvantaged areas through the rehabilitation of historic buildings for contemporary uses.  The Trust&rsquo;s plan for the Debtors&rsquo; Prison was to convert it into apartments to provide social housing.  During this time, major works were carried out to the roof, windows and external structure and significant progress was made to the interior fit out.  However, due to difficulties with Trust funding for the project, the works ceased and the lease was surrendered to the Commissioners in 2006.<\/p>  <p>  Over the years, the OPW has consulted widely on a potential use for this historic property.  The bodies consulted or who expressed an interest in the property include Dublin City Council, The Arts Council of Ireland, the founder of Fumbally Exchange (a not-for-profit movement of creative and innovative professionals who share co-working spaces), local small gallery owners, Sage Advocacy, the Design Tower, UCD School of Architecture, Dublin Institute of Technology, the EU Turas Project and former members of the Green Street Trust.  <\/p>  <p>  The possible future uses identified for the Debtors&rsquo; Prison were <\/p>  <p>  1. Office Accommodation for the Civil Service<\/p>  <p>  2. Commercial Office Accommodation leased to a Third Party<\/p>  <p>  3. Artists&rsquo; Studios<\/p>  <p>  4. Film Location<\/p>  <p>  5. Transfer to another State Agency<\/p>  <p>  6. Disposal on the open market<\/p>  <p>  Each of these possible uses were examined and found to have some merits.  However, substantial investment was required to bring the property up to a safe standard for use.  This investment would have included mechanical, electrical, and related installations including the provision of a heating system, works to provide for universal access and works to meet fire safety standards in addition to all works to make the building compliant with current building regulations. <\/p>  <p>  In mid-2017, the Peter Mc Verry Trust (PMVT) approached the OPW to open discussions regarding the possibility of the Debtors&rsquo; Prison being made available to them for uses as accommodation for the homeless. In early 2018, following confirmation that the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government had approved funding, the OPW approached Dublin City Council (DCC) to offer the property for sale, for use by the PMVT, under Department of Public Expenditure and Reform (D\/PER) Circular 11\/15: Protocols for the Transfer and Sharing of State Property Assets. <\/p>  <p>  In May 2018, the PMVT informed the OPW that DCC did not intend to proceed with acquiring the property for them, as the Council did not feel that the proposal was viable.<\/p>  <p>  Later in 2018, the OPW approached the Courts Service as the adjoining property owner to establish if they required the property.  The Courts Service advised that they had no requirement for the property, particularly due to the level of investment that would be needed.<\/p>  <p>  In the intervening period, a number of organisations have expressed an interest in acquiring the property under licence\/lease. The uses included; artists&rsquo; studios, performance space, employment support service and advocacy service.  These proposals have not been pursued by the relevant parties due to the substantial costs to a protected structure that would amount to several million euro.<\/p>  <p>  In March 2019, the OPW and DCC jointly inspected the property and in December 2019 negotiations on the transfer of the property commenced.  In February 2020, the OPW informed DCC that the transfer of the property to DCC would be under D\/PER Circular 11\/15: Protocols for the Transfer and Sharing of State Property Assets and in April 2020 DCC informed the OPW that the Council  no longer wished to acquire the property.<\/p>  <p>  The policy of the Office of Public Works with regard to vacant properties and sites is to:<\/p>  <p>  1. Identify if the property is required for alternative State use by Government departments or the wider public sector.<\/p>  <p>  2. If there is no other State use identified for a property, the OPW will then consider disposing of the property on the open market, if and when conditions prevail, in order to generate revenue for the Exchequer.<\/p>  <p>  3. If no State requirement is identified or if a decision is taken not to dispose of a particular property, the OPW may consider community involvement subject to detailed written submission which would indicate that the community\/voluntary group has the means to insure, maintain and manage the property and that there are no ongoing costs for the Exchequer.<\/p>  <p>  I am advised by the Commissioners of Public Works that the OPW continues to work with State Agencies to identify a future use for the Debtors&rsquo; Prison and in the interim, the OPW continues to facilitate the film industry in the use of the property as a film location.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102500084#WRM01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1494"},{"type":"question","counter":595,"qnumday":276,"qnumall":"[53325\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102500084#WRM01200","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the reason that the Office of Public Works will not allow access to the swimming pool in the Garda college, Templemore, in order that a person can provide swimming and water safety and life-saving classes.","asker":"1613","askee":"1459"},{"type":"speech","counter":596,"content":"<p>While the Commissioners do not comment on individual licence applications, I can confirm that the OPW has supported the long tradition of the Garda authorities making the facilities at the Garda College available to the community for use by local schools and community\/voluntary groups.<\/p>  <p>  The swimming pool in the Garda Training College is primarily for use by the trainees at the College, but they can be made available to local schools and community\/voluntary groups, where appropriate.

The Commission is the principal regulator of recruitment and selection processes within the public service. It has a statutory role to ensure that appointments in the organisations subject to its remit (that is, those that fall under the authority and scope of the Commission) are made on candidates&rsquo; merit and as the result of fair and transparent appointment processes. Its primary role is to ensure probity and fairness are at the heart of public service recruitment.  While the CPSA can deal with complaints from candidates about selection processes they have participated in, it does not undertake recruitment itself and therefore has no direct responsibility for the operation of any particular recruitment process, including the timeliness of any such process.<\/p>  <p>  The Public Service Management (Recruitment and Appointments) Act 2004 also established the Public Appointments Service (PAS) and gave it powers regarding the undertaking of recruitment for the civil service and certain other public service bodies. These powers include responsibility for operational issues in recruitment in the public service bodies for which PAS has remit.<\/p>  <p>  The Public Appointments Service runs a wide range of &lsquo;openly advertised&rsquo; recruitment competitions and &lsquo;interdepartmental&rsquo; promotion competitions within the Civil Service.  The activities are primarily focused on the sourcing of candidates for roles in the Civil Service; the most senior roles in Local Authorities; trainee Garda, and some promotional campaigns for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na; and a range of management, executive and specialist roles across the civil and public service.  The Public Appointments Service also has a key role in the identification of suitable members for State Boards.<\/p>  <p>  For competitions which are run for specific clients, PAS agrees the competition timeline with the client at the outset of the process, however, situations can occur which impact on PAS&rsquo;s capacity to meet the agreed delivery dates.  When there is a delay in the process PAS will communicate this to the client and take whatever action is necessary to get the process back on track. <\/p>  <p>  PAS runs a large number of competitions for specialist and generic roles from which clients across the civil service can draw on. In the context of the current challenging recruitment market, PAS has experienced reduced candidate applications, and increased attrition rates throughout all stages of the process.  The candidate pools for most of our generic competitions are being quickly exhausted and PAS has had to run more competitions over the last two years than we would previously have needed. As a result, increased resources and effort is being absorbed in an attempt to maintain the required service delivery levels.  <\/p>  <p>  Over the course of 2021 and 2022, PAS has also experienced an unscheduled increase in demand for resources from across the civil and public service.  In 2021, PAS had a 51% increase in the number of requests received from the previous year.  This trend has continued into this year as the volume of requests received to date has already surpassed the volume of requests received for the whole of 2021. While PAS makes every effort to deliver a quality service to our clients, many of the factors due to the extremely challenging market are impacting our service delivery timelines in some areas. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102500084#WRM01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1459"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Collection","counter":600,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102500084#WRM01700"},{"type":"question","counter":601,"qnumday":278,"qnumall":"[53345\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102500084#WRM01800","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the breakdown of expenditure from the revenue gained by carbon tax.","asker":"1574","askee":"1459"},{"type":"speech","counter":602,"content":"<p>The Programme for Government commits to a gradual increase in the carbon tax over the next decade to reach &euro;100 a tonne by 2030.

Specifically, it commits that of the &euro;9.5bn, &euro;3bn is to be allocated to targeted social welfare and other initiatives to ensure a Just Transition, &euro;5bn is to be allocated to energy efficiency, and the remaining &euro;1.5bn is to be allocated to green agricultural measures.<\/p><p>As part of the suite of Budget Day publications, the Department publishes a paper detailing the uses of the additional revenues raised by the annual increase in the carbon tax rate. This paper entitled, <i>the<\/i><i>Use of Carbon Tax Funds 2023<\/i>is available on my Department's website. <\/p><p>In 2023, spending of &euro;623m is being funded by the carbon tax.

This brings total carbon tax funding for energy efficiency to &euro;291m in 2023. This investment will support over 37,000 home energy upgrades (including solar PV), including over 13,800 homes to a Building Energy Rating (BER) of B2 and 6,000 free upgrades to the homes of those in, or at risk of, energy poverty. <\/p><p>In 2023, an additional &euro;78m in funding has been allocated for the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, bringing total carbon tax spending to &euro;81m compared with just &euro;3m in 2022.

Beyond ACRES, the remaining &euro;3m of the 2023 carbon tax funds will support other initiatives, including a demonstration anaerobic digestion project.<\/p><p>The Department of Social Protection is receiving an additional allocation of &euro;44m in 2023. This brings the total carbon tax funding for social protection to &euro;218m in 2023.

Strong protections for the rights of the fishing community are enshrined in the legally binding NMPF Fisheries policies. These polices reflect the public consultation responses received from the fishing community during the development of the NMPF.  Consequently, the NMPF includes a detailed section on fisheries (section 16) and a series of policies on fisheries, which will inform the assessment of all planning applications in the maritime area.<\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, in response to some specific issues raised during these consultations, and in agreement with my colleagues the Minister for Environment, Climate and Communications and the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, a seafood\/ORE working group has been established to assist the managed introduction of the offshore renewables industry into the maritime area.

This includes the delivery of 90,000 social homes by 2030. Housing for All is supported by an investment package of over &euro;4bn per annum, through an overall combination of &euro;12bn in direct Exchequer funding, &euro;3.5bn in funding through the Land Development Agency and &euro;5bn funding through the Housing Finance Agency.<\/p>  <p>  Under Housing for All, the Government will deliver 47,600 new build social homes and 3,500 social homes through long-term leasing in the period 2022-2026. Our clear focus is to increase the stock of social housing through new build projects delivered by local authorities and Approved Housing Bodies (AHB) and, with this, to reduce the numbers of social homes delivered through acquisition programmes. However, acquisitions of second hand properties for social housing fall under a number of local authority and Approved Housing Body (AHB) acquisitions programmes.<\/p>  <p>  On 19 January my Department issued a circular letter to local authorities advising that social housing acquisitions by local authorities and AHB CALF acquisitions in 2022 would be focussed on a number of priority areas, as follows:<\/p>  <p>  - One-bedroom units to deliver on Housing First and meet the short supply in this category;- Other properties that allow persons\/families to exit homelessness; and- Specific housing required for\/suitable for individuals with a disability or other particular priority needs.<\/p>  <p>  Local authorities were also advised that limited acquisitions through the Capital Assistance Scheme will also be approved, subject to the available budget for specific vulnerable cohorts, such as housing for older people, accommodation for individuals and families who are homeless and for people with a disability.<\/p>  <p>  On 20 April, a further circular letter issued to local authorities in relation to social housing acquisitions. The key purpose of this circular was to advise local authorities that I had reinstated the delegated sanction to local authorities in respect of social housing acquisitions which are:<\/p>  <p>  (i) in one of the priority categories set out in the January circular letter; (ii) in line with acquisition cost guidelines; and (iii) can be completed during 2022.<\/p>  <p>  The reinstatement of delegated sanction will allow local authorities to respond more flexibility to secure acquisitions which support a household to exit or to prevent homelessness.

This arrangement is in place to ensure that Irish Water performs to a high standard, keeps the public and other key stakeholders informed of its performance, and supports the CRU in making evidence-based decisions in the interests of customers.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to the above, section 8 of the Water Services Act 2014 makes provision for the CRU to provide a dispute resolution service for any unresolved complaints of customers of Irish Water. Further information on pursuing complaints with Irish Water or with the CRU is available on the website of the CRU and can be accessed from the following weblink - www.cru.ie\/home\/complaint-form\/water\/.<\/p>  <p>  As will be clear from the above, neither I nor my Department has a role in relation to matters raised in the question which are operational matters for Irish Water in the first instance, or, where a satisfactory outcome is not forthcoming, for the CRU in its capacity as independent economic regulator.<\/p>  <p>  I have brought the matters raised to the attention of Irish Water, and I understand that it will respond directly to the Deputy in relation to his concerns.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102500085#WRN05500","answer":true,"speaker":"1561"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":700,"content":"<p>Question No. 309 answered with Question No. 308.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Housing Schemes","counter":701,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102500085#WRN05700"},{"type":"question","counter":702,"qnumday":310,"qnumall":"[53024\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102500085#WRN05800","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"if there are any plans to provide housing-with-care accommodation schemes in County Mayo (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1500","askee":"1561"},{"type":"speech","counter":703,"content":"<p>I understand that the Deputy is referring to enabling disabled people living independently with supports.<\/p><p>I launched the second joint National Housing Strategy for Disabled People (NHSDP) 2022-2027, on 14 January 2022 together with Minister O'Brien and Ms Anne Rabbitte, T.D., Minister of State with responsibility for Disability.<b><\/b>The new Strategy sets out the vision for the cooperation and collaboration of Government Departments, state agencies and others in delivering housing and the related supports for disabled people over the next five years.

Under this procedure, a household may apply for support to one housing authority only, which may be the authority for the area in which the household normally resides or with which it has a local connection, or the authority that agrees, at its discretion, to assess the household for support.  A household, meeting either the residence or local connection condition, may specify up to three areas of choice for receipt of support in the areas of all housing authorities in the county and city concerned and, if qualified, will be entered on the housing waiting list of each of those housing authorities. <\/p>  <p>  Under Housing Assistance Payment (HAP), households at risk of homelessness may be eligible for additional supports.

In order to reduce these costs, thereby making the rent lower and more affordable for the tenant, upfront State capital subsidies are being deployed including the Cost Rental Equity Loan (CREL) scheme for Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs) and the Affordable Housing Fund (AHF) for Local Authorities. As such, income limits are important in targeting these limited State resources at those who fall within the moderate income cohort and are considered most in need of support. <\/p>  <p>  This net income limit of &euro;53,000 for Cost Rental is equivalent to gross incomes in the region of &euro;80,000 per year for single and dual-income households. This income eligibility limit was informed by considering affordability and the cost rents achievable under CREL and with data on median income levels.  The parameters for Cost Rental eligibility will be kept under review to ensure the scheme best targets the support provided.<\/p>  <p>  Households who are eligible for Cost Rental or who may be in receipt of household incomes in excess of the scheme&rsquo;s eligibility limit may also eligible for the range of schemes that the Government has introduced under its Housing for All strategy to support those who wish to purchase their own home.  This includes the First Home scheme and the Local Authority Affordable Purchase scheme. These are in addition to existing supports through the Local Authority Home Loan and the Help to Buy scheme, which are all designed to assist first-time buyers to obtain the mortgage finance necessary to purchase their own home.<\/p>  <p>The First Home scheme has begun to provide affordably constrained first-time buyers with assistance to bridge the gap between the level of funding they can access through a mortgage and the price of a new home.  Homes under the scheme must be made available at prices below &euro;450,000 in the Dublin region.  It is worth noting that South Dublin and Fingal represent the significant majority of new First Time Buyer Homes in Dublin and the median price of these homes in these local authority areas is &euro; 395,000 and &euro; 420,000 respectively.  Given both the 20% of equity support available under First Home and the recent announcement by the Central Bank amending the macro prudential rules to allow Loan to Value ratios of 4:1 times annual income from January 1st   2023, there would be new homes available through the scheme for those on household incomes of below &euro;80,000 in Dublin.<\/p>  <p>  Separately, the first properties are also being sold under the Local Authority affordable purchase scheme, funded by my Department's Affordable Housing Fund and the scheme will ramp up delivery from this point forward. For example,  the first 16 homes at Kilcarbery Grange, a South Dublin County Council development, are being sold to eligible purchasers at between &euro;245,600 and &euro;285,300, well below the median first-time buyer price of &euro;385,000 for a home in the area.

These include the development of a workforce plan for educational psychologists within the Department of Education and work has begun with other Government Departments to advance this.<\/p>  <p>  A number of options were considered to address some immediate supply issues. Following analysis of these, it was decided that the Department would use some available NEPS funding to sponsor a cohort of third year students of the Educational Psychology Doctoral programme in University College Dublin (UCD) and Mary Immaculate College (MIC) University of Limerick, for the academic year 2022\/23 by providing a contribution towards their fees and associated expenses.  The workforce planning group referred to above will be asked to make some interim recommendations in Q2 of next year regarding any other short-term measures required in advance of their final report. It is envisaged that funding supports for students on the educational psychological doctorate programme will be considered as part of this process.<\/p>  <p>  In the interim, given the particular time pressures for students in third year of the programme, interviews will be held in the coming months to provide financial support to those students of Educational Psychology, currently on training placements in NEPS who are due to complete their doctoral training programme in 2023.

My Department has no authority to compel a school to admit a student, except in circumstances where an appeal under section 29 of the Education Act, 1998 has been allowed and the appeals committee directs that the school admit the child concerned.<\/p>  <p>  A section 29 appeal must be made no later than 63 calendar days from the date of the school&rsquo;s decision to refuse admission.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to note that if refused admission is due to the school being oversubscribed, and the applicant wishes to appeal this decision they must firstly make a written request to the school seeking a review of the board of management&rsquo;s decision.  This request for a review to the board of management is time bound and must be made within 21 calendar days from the date of the decision by the school to refuse admission to the child.<\/p>  <p>  If refused admission for a reason other than the school being oversubscribed, the applicant may, but is not required to, request a review by the board of management within 21 calendar days from the date of the decision by the school to refuse admission to the child.  Where refused admission for a reason other than the school being oversubscribed and where the applicant does not choose to seek a review by the board of management, they may make an appeal to an independent appeals committee no later than 63 calendar days from the date of the school&rsquo;s decision to refuse admission.<\/p>  <p>  Full details on the section 29 appeals process for refused enrolment are available on the Gov.ie website at the links below:<\/p>  <p>  www.gov.ie\/en\/publication\/8248c-appeals-in-relation-to-refusal-to-admit-a-student-due-to-a-school-being-oversubscribed\/.<\/p>  <p>  www.gov.ie\/en\/publication\/31c4f-appeals-in-relation-to-refusal-to-admit-a-student-for-a-reason-other-than-the-school-being-oversubscribed\/.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, Tusla Education Support Services (TESS) the Educational Welfare Service is the legal body which can assist parents who are experiencing difficulty in securing a school placement for their child.

The correspondence raises the important matter of mental health support for young people. <\/p>  <p>  The wellbeing of all in the school community remains a priority for this Department and significant funding continues to be invested in this area. The Department&rsquo;s Wellbeing Policy and Framework for practice has given recognition to the importance of promoting wellbeing in education.  The approach set out in the Wellbeing Policy is a whole school and preventative approach which has multiple components that include providing children and young people with opportunities to build core social and emotional skills and competencies, experience supportive relationships within the school setting and be part of a school environment and culture that feels both physically and psychologically safe. <\/p>  <p>  Aligned with this policy, a number of supports are currently being offered to schools to support wellbeing and mental health.<\/p>  <p>  -  Schools are encouraged to use a reflective, school self-evaluation approach to identify and prioritise the needs of its own school community in relation to the promotion of wellbeing and mental health, and to respond to meeting those needs.  To support schools in this work the Professional Development Service for Teachers (PDST) is currently providing training to schools to ensure that the promotion of wellbeing will be at the core of the ethos of every school. Schools will be navigated through an introduction to the Wellbeing Framework and how to use the School Self Evaluation (SSE) process in guiding wellbeing promotion in their schools. These seminars will be supported by two webinars and in-school visits.  <\/p>  <p>  - NEPS has developed training for school staff on the promotion of wellbeing and resilience in schools which include upskilling school staff on the use and implementation of therapeutically-informed approaches in schools.  These include trauma-informed approaches, approaches based on the principles of cognitive behaviour therapy, and attachment-aware approaches. The approaches outlined in the training are based on research findings, on the experience of experts in their fields and on the experience of practicing psychologists working in schools. The training will build the capability of school staff in both primary and post-primary settings, including for school leaders, teachers and SNAs.<\/p>  <p>  -  NEPS will shortly resume the provision of training for school staff on the Friends for Life programmes to help reduce anxiety in children and also the Incredible Years Classroom Management System.  Priority will be given to schools new to DEIS.<\/p>  <p>  -  NEPS has launched an eLearning course - Responding to Critical Incidents in Schools.  This course is aimed specifically at the school&rsquo;s Critical Incident Management Team, but open to all interested staff. <\/p>  <p>  -  NEPS has developed a number of resources to support the wellbeing of children and young people from Ukraine enrolling in schools in Ireland.  This includes:<\/p>  <p>  Revised Guidance for primary and post &ndash; primary schools in relation to supporting the wellbeing of children\/young people from Ukraine at this time. This includes support for students with special educational needs.<\/p>  <p>  Guidance for Parents and Carers from Ukraine on Supporting the Wellbeing of their Children<\/p>  <p>  A model of Psychological First Aid (PFA) to help teachers support students. The document is called Look, Listen &amp;amp; Link.<\/p>  <p>  NEPS has also delivered a series of wellbeing webinars via the Education Support Centres of Ireland, to further support schools.<\/p>  <p>  The programmes and initiatives set out above are in addition to the educational psychological support that NEPS provide to all primary and post-primary schools. This involves direct support in the event of a critical incident, access to national and regional support and development work to build school capacity to support students, access to individual pupil casework where there is need. NEPS works closely with the HSE and its agencies to ensure those who may require the provision of therapy or counselling are referred on to the appropriate clinical services for intervention and support.<\/p>  <p>  While the Department of Health has responsibility for mental health services in Ireland, my Department has an important role to support the wellbeing and positive mental health of all our young people. My Department has built strong links with the Department of Health and both Departments are exploring ways to improve supports for young people, including around increased awareness, promoting help-seeking behaviour and sign-posting to the wide range of available services.  I am pleased to confirm that we will invest more than &euro;5 million in piloting a programme of counselling supports for primary school students.  Details of this pilot will be made available in due course.  This will serve to support the very positive work which already takes place in the area of wellbeing in our schools. <\/p>  <p>  I also announced in the budget, an additional 54 educational psychologists to provide services to special schools and special classes as part of budget 2023.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102500089#WRR03100","answer":true,"speaker":"1582"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Facilities","counter":919,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102500089#WRR03200"},{"type":"question","counter":920,"qnumday":386,"qnumall":"[52956\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102500089#WRR03300","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if she will provide the schedule for the commencement and completion of construction of the long-delayed college (details supplied) in view of the severe lack of school capacity in Enfield, County Meath; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1506","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":921,"content":"<p>The permanent accommodation for the school referred to by the Deputy is being delivered under my Department&rsquo;s Design and Build Programme.

My Department does not have a role in making individual school determinations. Accordingly your correspondence has been forwarded to the NCSE for direct reply.<\/p>  <p>  The Special Needs Assistant (SNA) scheme is designed to provide schools with additional adult support staff who can assist children with special educational needs who also have additional and significant care needs.  Such support is provided in order to facilitate the attendance of those pupils at school and also to minimise disruption to class or teaching time for the pupils concerned, or for their peers, and with a view to developing their independent living skills.<\/p>  <p>  SNAs are not allocated to individual children but to schools as a school based resource. The deployment of SNAs within schools is a matter for the individual Principal\/Board of Management of the school.  SNAs should be deployed by the school in a manner which best meets the care support requirements of the children enrolled in the school for whom SNA support has been allocated. <\/p>  <p>  It is a matter for schools to allocate support as required, and on the basis of individual need, which allows schools flexibility in how the SNA support is utilised. <\/p>  <p>  In relation to SNA support the NCSE has confirmed that the school has an allocation of SNA support to provide support for children with primary care needs.<\/p>  <p>  The following arrangements for the allocation of SNA support in respect of students in mainstream classes for 2022\/23 will apply:<\/p>  <p>  a) The SNA allocations for mainstream classes in schools on 31st May 2022 will be maintained for 2022\/23. This will provide greater certainty for schools. <\/p>  <p>  b) A process for schools, whereby if they consider their SNA allocation is in excess of the required care needs, to engage with the NCSE. Schools should contact their local NCSE Special Education Needs Organiser (SENO) to commence the process. <\/p>  <p>  c) The exceptional review process undertaken by NCSE will remain in place throughout the 2022\/23 school year, where schools can seek a review of their SNA allocations which will result in one of the following outcomes: <\/p>  <p>  i. No change in the level of care need identified (and no change in the resultant SNA allocation); <\/p>  <p>  ii. Increase in the level of care need identified (which if significant would see an increase in the SNA allocations to the schools) ; <\/p>  <p>  iii. Decrease in level of care need identified in the school (which if significant would result in a reduction in SNA allocations as the care need could be managed with less resources than are currently allocated); In relation to outcome iii, the SNA allocation will be adjusted at the end of the relevant school term. <\/p>  <p>  It is expected that schools will review and reprioritise the deployment of SNAs within mainstream settings and allocate resources to ensure those with the greatest level of need receive the greatest level of support. Providing access to SNA support continues to be based on primary care needs as outlined in DES Circular 0030\/2014  circulars.gov.ie\/pdf\/circular\/education\/2014\/30.pdf.<\/p>  <p>  Following such a review and reprioritisation, it is expected that a small number of schools, e.g. developing schools, may not have a sufficient SNA allocation to meet the needs of their students. These schools can apply to the NCSE for an Exceptional Review of their allocation.<\/p>  <p>  Detailed information on the NCSE Exceptional Review process is published on the NCSE website. ncse.ie\/application-for-sna-exceptional-review.<\/p>  <p>  The NCSE will endeavour to respond to all applications for Exceptional Review received as expediently as possible and in that regard, it will prioritise applications from schools with no current SNA allocation and developing schools. The Exceptional Review process for mainstream allocations will be available to schools throughout the 2022\/23 school year.<\/p>  <p>  The NCSE has developed an appeal mechanism for schools who are not satisfied with the outcome of the Exceptional Review. Local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs) will provide information and clarification to schools on the outcome where requested. Where schools wish to appeal the outcome of the review, they must do so using the prescribed form provided by the NCSE ncse.ie\/ncse-appeals-process.<\/p>  <p>  The NCSE has published the SNA allocations for the 2022\/23 school year, and they are available at ncse.ie\/set-hours-and-sna-allocations.<\/p>  <p>  All schools have the contact details of their local SENO, and the SENO is available to offer assistance and advice to the school. Parents may also contact their local SENO directly to discuss their child's special educational needs, using the contact details available on www.ncse.ie.<\/p>  <p>  I hope this information is of assistance to you.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102500089#WRR05400","answer":true,"speaker":"1582"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Transport","counter":942,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102500089#WRR05500"},{"type":"question","counter":943,"qnumday":395,"qnumall":"[53263\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102500089#WRR05600","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if she will consider the provision of a school transport service for a student (details supplied).","asker":"1618","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":944,"content":"<p>The School Transport Scheme is a significant operation managed by Bus &Eacute;ireann on behalf of the Department.

This new funding model supports the delivery of early learning and childcare for the public good, for quality and affordability for children, parents and families as well as stability and sustainability for providers. <\/p><p>Together for Better brings together three major programmes, the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme, including the Access and Inclusion Model (AIM), the National Childcare Scheme (NCS) and the new Core Funding scheme.<\/p><p>For the programme year 2022\/2023, services that deliver the ECCE programme will receive standard capitation in respect of registered children and will have the option to also avail of Core Funding. <\/p><p>ECCE provides funding on the basis of registered children at the rate of &euro;69 per child per week.  Services can have up to 11 children per one staff member in line with the statutory regulations for this type of provision.<\/p><p>Core Funding provides funding based on a service's capacity (opening hours, number of places and age group of children), and graduate premiums for lead educators and managers. Base rate allocations for capacity at the sessional pre-school rate offers &euro;0.65 per child place per hour and the graduate lead educator premium allocation is &euro;4.44 per hour.  Core Funding is paid based on child places, whether or not those places are filled.<\/p><p>Core Funding operates in addition to and alongside ECCE, AIM, CCSP and NCS.  It replaces the approach to paying for graduate lead educators through ECCE that operated under the previous funding model (higher capitation) and incorporates funding previously allocated to the discretionary Programme Support Payments (PSP) from September 2022.  These developments allocate funding more fairly in respect of graduates and administration.<\/p><p>Services whose sessions did not have a graduate lead educator in 2021\/22 will see capitation increase by at least 9.5% through the Core Funding base rate. This is before any potential Graduate Manager Premium is awarded to the service, which is worth an additional &euro;2,530.80 per ECCE session. In addition, any provision offered outside of the 15 ECCE hours per week will further increase Core Funding income to the service.<\/p><p>A full comparison of income under the previous funding model (ECCE standard capitation plus PSP) and the new funding model (ECCE standard capitation plus Core Funding) is published online and outlined below in tabular form. The data provided below is stylised for typical service models and makes assumptions about service capacity in order to estimate income. It also includes income from ECCE and Core Funding for ECCE hours only and does not include income available to services through the Access and Inclusion Model or other income such as from parental fees for extra services. <table>    <tr>       <th>-<\/th>       <th><\/th>       <th><\/th>       <th><div>Standard Capitation services<\/div><\/th>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Number of children<\/td>       <td>Previous hourly service income (ECCE plus PSP)<\/td>       <td>Core Funding hourly service income<\/td>       <td>Difference<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>8<\/td>       <td>&euro;38.35<\/td>       <td>&euro;43.95<\/td>       <td>14.6%<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>9<\/td>       <td>&euro;43.14<\/td>       <td>&euro;48.55<\/td>       <td>12.5%<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>10<\/td>       <td>&euro;47.94<\/td>       <td>&euro;53.15<\/td>       <td>10.9%<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>11<\/td>       <td>&euro;52.73<\/td>       <td>&euro;57.75<\/td>       <td>9.5%<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>12<\/td>       <td>&euro;57.52<\/td>       <td>&euro;69.50<\/td>       <td>20.8%<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>13<\/td>       <td>&euro;62.32<\/td>       <td>&euro;74.10<\/td>       <td>18.9%<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>14<\/td>       <td>&euro;67.11<\/td>       <td>&euro;78.70<\/td>       <td>17.3%<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>15<\/td>       <td>&euro;71.91<\/td>       <td>&euro;83.30<\/td>       <td>15.8%<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>16<\/td>       <td>&euro;76.70<\/td>       <td>&euro;87.90<\/td>       <td>14.6%<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>17<\/td>       <td>&euro;81.49<\/td>       <td>&euro;92.50<\/td>       <td>13.5%<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>18<\/td>       <td>&euro;86.29<\/td>       <td>&euro;97.10<\/td>       <td>12.5%<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>19<\/td>       <td>&euro;91.08<\/td>       <td>&euro;101.70<\/td>       <td>11.7%<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>20<\/td>       <td>&euro;95.87<\/td>       <td>&euro;106.30<\/td>       <td>10.9%<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>21<\/td>       <td>&euro;100.67<\/td>       <td>&euro;110.90<\/td>       <td>10.2%<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>22<\/td>       <td>&euro;105.46<\/td>       <td>&euro;115.50<\/td>       <td>9.5%<\/td>    <\/tr> <\/table> <\/p><p>ECCE services with a graduate lead educator will almost all see increases in income, although it may be smaller proportionally given the significant level of funding available under the old funding model.

In 2021\/2022, ECCE sessional services with 22 children received income of &euro;1,829.30 per week under ECCE higher capitation and PSP. This will be matched in Core Funding.

My Department has extensive data on providers&rsquo; existing and projected income and delivery costs through data from Revenue, surveys and demographic and macro-economic information and has extensively analysed the question of sustainability. <\/p><p>Data available prior to the additional investment of Core Funding in the sector showed that the median surplus (income in excess of cost) for sector as a whole of 4%. However, services with the characteristics correlated with ECCE-only provision had higher levels of surplus than other types of provision &ndash; ranging from 14% to 23% depending on the characteristic.<blockquote>-  Do not offer full day: 17% income in excess of cost<br \/><br \/>-  Do not offer wrap-around care: 16% income in excess of cost<br \/><br \/>- Open exactly 38 weeks each year: 19% income in excess of cost<br \/><br \/>- Low total numbers of childcare hours: 23% income in excess of cost<br \/><br \/>- Single-site services: 14% income in excess of cost<br \/><br \/>- Those whose only income source is ECCE funding: 19% income in excess of cost<\/blockquote>Separately Sole Traders, which constitute a large proportion of ECCE-only provision had an average income in excess of costs of 23%.<\/p><p>This evidence suggests that ECCE-only services had the highest levels of income in excess of costs compared to other types of provision. <\/p><p>The collection of information on income and costs is essential for the full understanding of this complex and diverse sector in order to inform the development of policy. As recommended by the Expert Group, there needs to be full visibility and understanding of financial information in the sector in order to better understand the impact and interaction of income, costs, surplus and profit in the sector.<\/p><p>I am pleased therefore that the recent data collection for the 2021\/2022 Annual Sector Profile, including questions on income and costs, has been completed by 93% of services. This new and emerging data will allow the Department to rerun income and cost analysis and ascertain the latest available financial position to inform the next policy developments.<\/p><p>Budget 2023 allocates &euro;1,025m to early learning and childcare &ndash; a clear demonstration from Government of the value of the sector. Further interrogation of the new Core Funding application and income and cost data is required in order to most effectively design developments in Year 2 of Core Funding. <\/p><p>For any services that are experiencing difficulty and who would like support can contact their City\/County Childcare Committee (CCC) to access case management supports.

There are supports, financial and otherwise, available to services who need them. Services are independent operators and may close for a number of reasons. Services that wish to deliver early learning and childcare for the public good will be supported to remain open to do so.   <\/p>  <p>  On 15th September, I launched Together for Better, the new funding model for early learning and childcare. This new funding model supports the delivery of early learning and childcare for the public good, for quality and affordability for children, parents and families as well as stability and sustainability for providers. Together for Better brings together three major programmes, the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme, including the Access and Inclusion Model (AIM), the National Childcare Scheme (NCS) and the new Core Funding scheme.<\/p>  <p>  While I note that the service in question has been cited in media reports, I will refrain from disclosing the financial and operational detail of any individual service in this reply. It is however in the public interest that the new funding model is understood and that there is not misleading or inaccurate information circulating and so the information provided in the course of this reply broadly covers issues of relevance. <\/p>  <p>  ECCE-only services across the country form an integral part of the early learning and childcare system. Their exact operations can vary but typically, they open to children for 15 hours per week, 38 weeks per year. The funding model for sessional services is now primarily a combination of the ECCE capitation they receive per child registered with them, (potentially including a top up AIM capitation if there is a staff member with the necessary qualification undertaking an inclusion role, plus additional AIM funding to employ additional staff or reduce adult child ratios if required to support the inclusion of all children), and the Core Funding grant services receive based on the capacity of their service and the qualifications levels of staff, as well as any optional extras they may charge parents.<\/p>  <p>  A significant feature to be aware of is that ECCE subsidies are paid based on the number of children registered in the service. This means that a service&rsquo;s income could reduce considerably if they do not maintain the number of children attending their service.  Core Funding operates alongside ECCE (and NCS) and by contrast to the other funding streams, provides payment in respect of the number of child places rather than based on child registrations or attendance. This intentional and deliberate differentiation of approach in the new funding model means the the Core Funding element of a service's income is a more stable income source that will not fluctuate year on year. This idea of funding capacity is a key new approach in Core Funding, which many providers advocated for through stakeholder consultation during the design of Core Funding. This mixture of supply-side and demand-led public funding provides a welcome balance to the funding model, and assists services who may be experiencing lower than anticipated child registrations for a number of reasons. <\/p>  <p>  Under Core Funding, the overwhelming majority of services will see an increase in their funding, most will see very substantial increases, and no services will see a decrease in funding if their circumstances remain the same.  ECCE services without a graduate lead educator will see capitation increase by at least 9.5% through Core Funding.  ECCE services with a graduate lead educator will almost all see increases in income, although it may be smaller proportionally given the significant level of funding available under the old funding model.  A very small number of services, less than 100 of the over 4,000 signed-up, will see no increase with their income matched to 2021\/2022. For this small number of services who do not experience an increase, a Funding Guarantee will apply. This will top-up Core Funding payments to match the difference in ECCE higher capitation and PSP from last year, provided they offer the same amount of graduate led provision as last year. These are larger ECCE-only services &ndash; with 20+ children in a session. <\/p>  <p>  Core Funding is distributed in a fair, reasonable and transparent manner that is related to services&rsquo; costs of delivery, contributing to both staff costs and non-staff overheads. Consequently, services opening longer hours or offering more places will receive a higher value of Core Funding than other services as they have higher delivery costs. This is connected to the staffing requirements of ELC and SAC as set out in Regulations.<\/p>  <p>  The staffing requirements for ECCE sessions are an adult child ratio of 1:11. The value of Core Funding is weighted in favour of sessional services for 2.5-6 year-olds. ECCE services receive proportionately more than other types of services relative to the staffing requirements of sessional pre-school provision. <\/p>  <p>  Through a combination of Core Funding and ECCE capitation, sessional services can now avail of weekly funding of at least &euro;78.75 per child in ECCE (&euro;69 ECCE capitation plus &euro;9.75 per week in Core Funding base rate). Where a service has less than full occupancy, the funding on a per child basis is even higher.  <\/p>  <p>  Core Funding is particularly beneficial to services who have seen significant reductions in child registrations by bolstering their income but it is important to note that Core Funding is intended to be a contribution to a service's income, alongside income from other funding schemes or parental income.  <\/p>  <p>  The logic underpinning the funding approach through ECCE and Core Funding is based on the staffing levels required by regulation. Services may choose to operate with staffing levels above the adult child ratio requirements, but it would not be appropriate for additional public funding is provided in these circumstances, save for circumstances of evidenced need as in AIM as this would risk overstaffing and the investment of substantial public money for unfilled places.  <\/p>  <p>  Together for Better is about getting the most out of the three early learning and childcare programmes, and ensuring stability and sustainability in the sector. I have been unequivocal that I do not want any services to be faced with financial sustainability issues and I am fully committed to working with any such service to support them in delivering early learning and childcare for the public good.<\/p>  <p>  We are not seeing evidence of a significant lack of sustainability for ECCE-only services or to suggest that services will face closure as a result of Core Funding. Services that are experiencing difficulty and who would like support are encouraged to contact their City\/County Childcare Committee (CCC) to access case management supports. Services can be assisted on an individual basis through this route and it also allows for trends and themes across the country to be identified that can inform a more systematic response if necessary.<\/p>  <p>  We are not receiving any indications from CCC that there have been providers reporting financial difficulties and in need of support. This case management process through the CCC is the route to access additional sustainability funding if required. <\/p>  <p>  Data from Tusla on numbers of closures in recent months show that the number of closures this year is broadly in line with other years, and reasons for closure (given to Tusla by providers that have closed) suggests considerable diversity in the reasons for closure. While some services have closed for financial or regulatory reasons, many have closed for other reasons (e.g. retirement of the owner\/manager). <\/p>  <p>  As indicated above, I will refrain from commenting publicly on the particulars of this case but I can confirm that Galway CCC has reached out to the service in question to offer support and guidance. For any service that does experience financial difficulties, financial and other supports are available, including a Sustainability Fund. This new strand of the Sustainability Fund, linked to Core Funding, is designed to provide an extra safety net for providers. This will be open to both private and community providers. <\/p>  <p>  To date, with the Core Funding scheme in operation for less than 6 weeks, 93% or well over 4,000 providers have signed up for Core Funding.  Already there is very significant evidence of success: <\/p>  <p>  - Core Funding has delivered improved pay and conditions for staff, through enabling Employment Regulation Orders to be agreed by employer and employee representatives in a landmark pay deal for the sector. <\/p>  <p>  - Core Funding has increased affordability for parents with a fee freeze in place and guaranteeing access to NCS subsidies, particularly the extension to the age eligibility for the universal subsidy which became available in August, the value of which will increase substantially from January 2023 <\/p>  <p>  - Core Funding offers greater stability and sustainability for providers by substantially increasing the overall investment in the sector, particularly through a supply-side funding approach and in providing funding for spaces rather than participating children.<\/p>  <p>  Due to the level of support provided for the past through years through Covid-19 funding - estimated to be in excess of &euro;1 billion - as well as the recent Transition Fund, many early learning and childcare services are in a strong financial position.  Available funding included the Temporary Wage Subsidy Childcare Scheme, Covid-19 capital grants, Reopening Support Payments, Ventilation grants, and Playing Outside Grants, in addition to the very substantial funding through the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme which covered the large majority of the wage bill for most services. <\/p>  <p>  The overwhelming majority of services will benefit substantially from higher funding under Core Funding, supporting their sustainability. The Department, Pobal and the CCC continue to closely monitor trends concerning services entering case management and will continue to maintain the availability of Sustainability Funding for individual services at risk.<\/p>  <p>  Budget 2023 allocates &euro;1.025 billion to early learning and childcare &ndash; a clear demonstration from Government of the value of the sector. Together for Better aims to transform the sector and I am committed to working with Partner Services delivering early learning and childcare for the public good.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102500094#WRW01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1477"},{"type":"question","counter":1226,"qnumday":491,"qnumall":"[53925\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102500094#WRW02100","dept":"Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","minister":"Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","question":"the supports that are available to services, either private or community, to support them with financial sustainability; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1449","askee":"1477"},{"type":"question","counter":1227,"qnumday":514,"qnumall":"[53413\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102500094#WRW02200","dept":"Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","minister":"Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","question":"the way in which many early learning and care services have engaged with county childcare committees in relation to financial sustainability in 2022; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1489","askee":"1477"},{"type":"question","counter":1228,"qnumday":517,"qnumall":"[53416\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102500094#WRW02300","dept":"Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","minister":"Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","question":"the supports that are available to services, either private or community, to support them with financial sustainability; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1489","askee":"1477"},{"type":"speech","counter":1229,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 491, 514 and 517 together.<\/p><p>Services which have financial or other sustainability concerns can avail of supports through the case management process.

This work has involved working very closely with the Housing Agency in the development of detailed policy advice papers including an acquisition policy and an ownership model, and since January the purchase of a range of properties across the country.<\/p><p>Twenty nine properties have been purchased to date at a cost of &euro;5.9m. All the properties purchased require an element of upgrading to make them habitable and work is currently ongoing with the Housing Agency to develop an Approved Housing Body (AHB) funding scheme, which will put a framework in place for the upgrading, management and ongoing maintenance of the properties.<\/p><p>It is not possible at this stage of the process to release any further information on the properties and their location while the AHB funding scheme is being developed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102500094#WRW04200","answer":true,"speaker":"1477"},{"type":"question","counter":1249,"qnumday":498,"qnumall":"[52862\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102500094#WRW04400","dept":"Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","minister":"Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","question":"the number of properties that are being leased by his Department that are currently vacant; and if he will provide a list of such properties.","asker":"1504","askee":"1477"},{"type":"speech","counter":1250,"content":"<p>I can inform the Deputy that my Department operates from a number of building locations including:<\/p><p>1.

A relevant parent is a parent, an adoptive parent, or a person acting in &lsquo;loco parentis&rsquo;. <\/p><p>In addition to unpaid leave, the suite of paid leaves has also been expanded in recent years.

In line with the EU Work Life Balance Directive 2019\/1158, the leave is non-transferable between parents to ensure that both parents are encouraged and supported in taking time out from work to bond with their child.

The Advisory Group has recommended that the growing surplus be used to address the skills challenges in the labour market.   However, any increase in NTF expenditure, all other things being equal and without a corresponding reduction on the Vote, requires an increase in my Department and overall Government expenditure ceilings. NTF expenditure increases general Government expenditure and can only be accommodated within the fiscal strategy agreed by Government.<\/p>  <p>  My Department has been working closely with other Departments to develop options for the application of the NTF to support skills priorities and develop the quality of the workforce.  With regard to the latter an expanded mandate for Skillnet Ireland in leading workforce development as the Government agency with extensive partnerships with industry and employees is envisaged.  The OECD is currently conducting a review of Ireland&rsquo;s approach to skills planning and development. These and other developments will support further policy consideration by Government of our skills priorities and investment strategy, including the role of the NTF.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102500096#WRY03700","answer":true,"speaker":"1493"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Research and Development","counter":1359,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102500096#WRY03800"},{"type":"question","counter":1360,"qnumday":538,"qnumall":"[53342\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102500096#WRY03900","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"his views on Ireland remaining a highly-skilled economy, when State investment in research as a percentage of GDP is below the EU average.","asker":"1596","askee":"1624"},{"type":"speech","counter":1361,"content":"<p>Ireland&rsquo;s policy of investing in our R&amp;I capability over the past twenty years has had a significant impact on our industrial development, contributing to job creation and economic prosperity. As a result of a sustained commitment to research, development and innovation, Ireland has successfully built-up research capacity and an international reputation for research excellence.<\/p>  <p>  Total public and private expenditure on R&amp;I (i.e., Gross Expenditure on R&amp;D or GERD) has increased significantly in recent years, from &euro;2.6 billion in 2011 to an estimated &euro;4.6 billion in 2020, a 79% increase in value. This increase has been largely driven by enterprise expenditure growth, from &euro;1.8 billion in 2011 to an estimated &euro;3.4 billion in 2020. <\/p>  <p>  Despite the significant increase in value of public and private expenditure on R&amp;I, limited progress has been achieved towards Ireland&rsquo;s previous research intensity rate target of 2.5% of GNP, which rose from 1.55% in 2015 to an estimated 1.63% in 2020. This is related, at least in part, to Ireland&rsquo;s economic growth which has increased at a rate well above the EU average: over the period 2009 to 2020, Ireland&rsquo;s GDP, GNP and GNI* grew by 120%, 102% and 55% respectively. In 2020, we stood at 1.23% and 2.21% of GDP and GNI* respectively.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland was ranked 6th in the EU for innovation performance in the 2022 European Innovation Scoreboard. This matches our previous peak position of 6th in 2016, and our position puts us higher than 13 other Member States that invest a higher proportion of GDP.  <\/p>  <p>  However, we cannot be complacent.  Failing to keep pace with other small, advanced economies in terms of investment in R&amp;I represents a significant risk to the competitiveness of our economy, to our labour market productivity, to the growth of high-value employment, to our attractiveness to FDI and to our global standing as a &lsquo;strong innovator&rsquo;. In addition, innovation will be crucial to developing solutions to meeting national challenges such as climate change and digitalisation &ndash; addressing these will require increased investment in R&amp;I to deliver responses beyond incremental improvements.<\/p>  <p>  Earlier this year, I launched Impact 2030: Ireland&rsquo;s Research and Innovation Strategy. Notwithstanding the highly competitive global environment, Impact 2030 will sustain and will improve our internationally recognised R&amp;I system, addressing any identified gaps emerging relative to competitors and leveraging our own particular strengths in order to position Ireland as a centre of R&amp;I excellence and impact.<\/p>  <p>  As part of our new overall research intensity rate target of 2.5% of GNI*, we will continue to increase public investment in order to deliver the solutions, the people and the academic-enterprise collaborations that will support a strong and sustainable economy that addresses key economic and societal challenges.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102500096#WRY04000","answer":true,"speaker":"1624"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Third Level Fees","counter":1362,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102500096#WRY04100"},{"type":"question","counter":1363,"qnumday":539,"qnumall":"[53431\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102500096#WRY04200","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if she will provide an update on the student grant appeal by a person (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1557","askee":"1624"},{"type":"speech","counter":1364,"content":"<p>Under the terms of the Student Grant Scheme, grant assistance is awarded to students attending an approved course in an approved institution who meet the prescribed conditions of funding, including those relating to nationality, residency, previous academic attainment and means.<\/p>  <p>  The decision on eligibility for a student grant is a matter, in the first instance, for the centralised student grant awarding authority SUSI (Student Universal Support Ireland) to determine.<\/p>  <p>  The student referred to by the Deputy has submitted an appeal to the Student Grant Appeals Board.

These measures allow people working in prostitution to provide information to the Garda&iacute; on, for example, violence towards them by clients, without risking prosecution for selling sexual services.<\/p>  <p>  The increase in the maximum penalty for brothel keeping was in recognition of the fact that those involved in the running of brothels often exploit vulnerable people for commercial gain and have links to organised crime. There are concerns that decriminalising brothel-keeping could create a loophole open to abuse by criminal gangs and others who wish to profit from prostitution.<\/p>  <p>  In line with these legislative changes, last year I announced an initiative to expunge previous convictions for &lsquo;sale of sex&rsquo;, or prostitution offences. The expunging provision when drafted will be limited to convictions for an offence under section 7 or 8 of the Act of Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 1993 where the person was convicted on the basis of evidence that they were offering their services as a prostitute to another person. <\/p>  <p>  A conviction for the offence of brothel keeping will not be expunged under the expungement initiative as it remains a criminal offence.<\/p>  <p>  The Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 2017 provided for a review of Part 4 of the Act which is currently underway.

The construction of a new male wing and a female prison is currently underway in Limerick Prison and will provide 90 additional male and 22 additional female cell spaces.  The new male accommodation is expected to become operational by the end of 2022 with the standalone female prison to become operational in Q1 2023.<\/p>  <p>  Significant growth has been experienced in the remand prison population in recent years which has resulted in pressures on remand prison facilities including Cloverhill Prison.

In respect of delivering on this commitment, I recently published the Review of Policy Options for Prison and Penal Reform 2022-2024. <\/p>  <p>  The review seeks to find the balance between ensuring that people who commit serious crimes receive a punishment and a period of incarceration proportionate to that crime, while at the same time acknowledging that sometimes community based sanctions are more appropriate in diverting offenders away from future criminal activity. <\/p>  <p>  Sentencing is a matter solely within the discretion of the trial judge, having regard to the circumstances of the case and of the accused and subject to any limits as may be prescribed by law for a particular offence. While these proposals cannot change this, they are intended to strengthen the options available to judges when they are considering cases, to facilitate the effective and efficient use of community sanctions by the courts, and to ensure that the courts have a wide range of appropriate options for dealing with people who have committed minor offences.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, as part of delivering the Penal Policy action plan, the need to ensure the continued availability of modern prison facilities with adequate capacity will continue to be central to the work of the Irish Prison Service and will be core to the development of the new Irish Prison Service Capital Strategy 2023.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102500097#WRZ02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1502"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na","counter":1408,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102500097#WRZ02600"},{"type":"question","counter":1409,"qnumday":554,"qnumall":"[53000\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102500097#WRZ02700","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of garda&iacute; by rank attached to each divisional roads policing unit as of 30 April 2021 and 18 October 2022, in tabular form; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1553","askee":"1502"},{"type":"speech","counter":1410,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will be aware, under the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 (as amended), the Garda Commissioner is responsible for the distribution of Garda resources between the various Garda Divisions.

Regulations were made in 1971, 1973 and 1975, prescribing 16 illnesses covered by the scheme. These are: acute leukaemia; mental handicap; cerebral palsy; mental illness (in a person under 16); cystic fibrosis; multiple sclerosis; diabetes insipidus; muscular dystrophies; diabetes mellitus; parkinsonism; epilepsy; phenylketonuria; haemophilia; spina bifida; hydrocephalus; and conditions arising from the use of Thalidomide.<\/p><p>Under the LTI scheme, patients receive drugs, medicines, and medical and surgical appliances directly related to the treatment of their illness, free of charge. <\/p><p>Statutory Instrument No. 277 of 1971 sets out the following limitation on Section 59(3) of the Health Act 1970: &quot;Arrangements for the supply of drugs and medicines to persons suffering from mental illness in pursuance of section 59 (3) of the Act shall be made only in respect of persons under the age of 16 years.&quot;<\/p><p>Therefore, the HSE must regard 16 years as the upper age limit in terms of eligibility under the LTI scheme for those with a diagnosis of mental illness. This has not been challenged by the Ombudsman.<\/p><p>It is important to note that the LTI scheme will be included as part of a review of the current eligibility framework, including the basis for existing hospital and medication charges, to be carried out under commitments given in the Sl&aacute;intecare Implementation Strategy. However, it is not possible at this juncture to say what the outcome of this review will be.<\/p><p>People who cannot, without undue hardship, arrange for the provision of medical services for themselves and their dependants may be eligible for a medical card. In accordance with the provisions of the Health Act 1970 (as amended), eligibility for a medical card is determined by the HSE. <\/p><p>In certain circumstances the HSE may exercise discretion and grant a medical card, even though an applicant exceeds the income guidelines, where he or she faces difficult financial circumstances, such as extra costs arising from illness. In circumstances where an applicant is still over the income limit for a medical card, they are then assessed for a GP visit card, which entitles the applicant to GP visits without charge.<\/p><p>For those aged between 16 and 25, who had been included on their family's medical card or GP visit card before turning 16, the HSE will send them their own card when they reach the age of 16.<\/p><p>In circumstance where a person over 16 is financially dependent on their parents or guardians, and their parents or guardians have not had a medical card,<b><\/b>the person may apply for a medical card if they have a medical condition. Their parents or guardians should also make an application and both applications should be sent to the HSE together. As a dependant, they will qualify if their parents or guardians qualify. <\/p><p>Where the applicant is financially independent, they can still apply if they live with their parents or guardians and are in receipt of their own income. <\/p><p>Under the Drug Payment Scheme, no individual or family pays more than &euro;80 a month towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines. The scheme significantly reduces the cost burden for families and individuals with ongoing expenditure on medicines.<\/p><p>Individuals may also be entitled to claim tax relief on the cost of their medical expenses, including medicines prescribed by a doctor, dentist, or consultant. Relief is at the standard tax rate of 20%.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102500098#WRAA04400","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Mental Health Services","counter":1488,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102500098#WRAA04500"},{"type":"question","counter":1489,"qnumday":580,"qnumall":"[52738\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102500098#WRAA04600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 550 of 27 September 2022, if he will provide a breakdown of the waiting times for those currently on the CAMHS waiting list;

The committee included representatives of all stakeholders, including advocacy representatives, and was chaired by Dr Siobhan Ni Bhriain on behalf of the chief clinical officer. <\/p>  <p>  The report acknowledged the additional funding made available to develop services in recent years. It advised on the development of seamless interfaces between agencies providing gender services. The committee agreed a job description for a consultant psychiatrist in child and adolescent psychiatry in CHO 7 and CHI to develop the service for those aged under 18 (and to replace the current system of psychological support provided by the Tavistock Clinic). The consultant psychiatrist would develop and lead a MDT to support the delivery of gender identity services. Subsequently, this position was advertised twice but has not yet been filled.<\/p>  <p>  In the interim, the Tavistock Clinic provides psychological assessments for Irish children seeking gender identity services, under the Treatment Abroad Scheme. The TAS enables a public healthcare consultant to refer a patient to the public health service in the EU, UK or Switzerland for treatment not available in Ireland. Once the criteria are met, the HSE is obliged to fund the care.<\/p>  <p>  A NHS-commissioned review of the Tavistock clinic has recommended closure and a move to a local\/regional approach to service provision, in line with other paediatric services. The HSE is reviewing the NHS report and assessing the potential impact for existing pathways of care and service delivery. The HSE national clinical advisory and group lead for mental health meets regularly with Tavistock Clinic to discuss waiting list issues.

These services are important to ensure that early diagnosis and action is available for patients, particularly as services continue to recover from Covid-19.

It is imperative that nursing homes manage potential cost pressures in line with their regulatory and contractual responsibilities, maintaining their quality of care so that residents&rsquo; lived experience and comfort is not affected.<\/p><p>  The Government has provided substantial supports to the nursing home sector over the course of the pandemic. Over &euro;144 million has been claimed by nursing homes under the Temporary Assistance Payment Scheme (TAPS) since its introduction in 2020. The Government has now agreed to extend TAPS to the end of the year by maintaining the availability of Outbreak Assistance support.<\/p><p>  Substantial additional supports have also been provided by the HSE in terms of serial testing, PPE, the deployment of specialist teams and other services. Many of these supports continue.<\/p><p>  Budget 2023 saw an additional &euro;180 million of funding for services for older people for winter 2022 and into 2023, building on unprecedented increases of recent years. This will bring investment in these services to over &euro;2.4 billion in 2023, including nearly &euro;12 million of new developments. Prior to Budget Day I stated that my priority was to secure additional funding for Budget 2023 to ensure the continuation of all services to a high standard. Long-term residential care will be supported through additional funding for the Nursing Homes Support Scheme (NHSS) to maintain services and manage inflationary increases.<\/p><p>  In addition, a significant fund of up to &euro;100m has been allocated this year to support community based service providers who are such an essential pillar in the provision of Health services across country. This fund is being made available in recognition of the challenges being faced by the sector in delivering and maintaining key health and social care services against a backdrop of increased inflationary pressures affecting energy, heating and related costs. These organisations are funded through the HSE to deliver a range of health and social care services on behalf of the HSE to communities around Ireland. This includes residential, day and ancillary services for people with a disability, older people, mental health services, palliative care services, addiction services and other health and social care services provided in the community.<\/p><p>  The details of the plan are being finalised. It is proposed that the inflation support fund will be administered by the HSE utilising the mechanisms in place for funding eligible organisations in receipt of Service Level Arrangements and Grant Aid Agreements. These arrangements are already in place with organisations that provide key health and social care services for people in Ireland.  It is proposed that payments will be made to eligible organisations in the final quarter of 2022 to meet the pressures of this coming winter. Many eligible organisations may be already operating within a context of increased inflationary pressures.<\/p><p>  For providers of long-term residential care who participate in the nursing home support scheme, funding will be allocated through the established mechanism of the Temporary Assistance Payment Scheme. Precise details of the scheme are being finalised and will be communicated in the coming days.<\/p><p>  To address strategic workforce challenges in the nursing home and home care sector, a Cross-Departmental Strategic Workforce Advisory Group (SWAG) was established in March 2022 and published a report on October 15th outlining 16 key recommendations spanning the areas of recruitment and retention, pay and conditions and overall sectoral reform. I strongly endorse the Group&rsquo;s recommendations to address the critical shortage of care workers in Ireland and a dedicated Implementation Group will start to progress these immediately.<\/p><p>  Funding to support people to access services in the sector continues to be provided in line with the long-established statutory mechanisms under the Nursing Homes Support Scheme Act 2009. This is the mechanism established by the Oireachtas to provide for the processes relating to funding under the NHSS and the negotiation of prices for services for private and voluntary providers with the designated State agency, the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF). Maximum prices for individual nursing homes are agreed with the NTPF following negotiations and based on the NTPF&rsquo;s cost criteria. These criteria include costs reasonably incurred by the nursing home, local market prices, historic prices and overall budgetary capacity. <\/p><p>  The NTPF carry out this role independently under the NHSS Act 2009. The NTPF has statutory independence, and there is no role for Ministers or the Department of Health in these negotiations. The Department of Health published a review of the NTPF pricing system in June 2021. It recommended several actions to improve the pricing system which are now being taken forward by the Department of Health and the NTPF.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102500102#WREE00600","answer":true,"speaker":"1614"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1698,"content":"<p>Question No. 647 answered with Question No. 646.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1699,"content":"<p>Question No. 648 answered with Question No. 646.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1700,"content":"<p>Question No. 649 answered with Question No. 571.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Nursing and Midwifery Board of Ireland","counter":1701,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102500102#WREE01000"},{"type":"question","counter":1702,"qnumday":650,"qnumall":"[53148\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102500102#WREE01100","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 580 of 4 October 2022, if he will provide details, in tabular form, relating to the panel of education assessors engaged by the Nursing and Midwifery Board of Ireland (NMBI) (details supplied);

It is imperative that nursing homes manage potential cost pressures in line with their regulatory and contractual responsibilities, maintaining their quality of care so that residents&rsquo; lived experience and comfort is not affected. <\/p>  <p>  The Government has provided substantial supports to the nursing home sector over the course of the pandemic. Over &euro;144 million has been claimed by nursing homes under the Temporary Assistance Payment Scheme (TAPS) since its introduction in 2020. The Government has now agreed to extend TAPS to the end of the year by maintaining the availability of Outbreak Assistance support.<\/p>  <p>  Budget 2023 saw an additional &euro;180 million of funding for services for older people for winter 2022 and into 2023, building on unprecedented increases of recent years. This will bring investment in these services to over &euro;2.4 billion in 2023, including nearly &euro;12 million of new developments. Prior to Budget Day I stated that my priority was to secure additional funding for Budget 2023 to ensure the continuation of all services to a high standard. Long-term residential care will be supported through additional funding for the Nursing Homes Support Scheme (NHSS) to maintain services and manage inflationary increases.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, a significant fund of up to &euro;100m has been allocated this year to support community based service providers who are such an essential pillar in the provision of Health services across country.  This fund is being made available in recognition of the challenges being faced by the sector in delivering and maintaining key health and social care services against a backdrop of increased inflationary pressures affecting energy, heating and related costs.  These organisations are funded through the HSE to deliver a range of health and social care services on behalf of the HSE to communities around Ireland. This includes residential, day and ancillary services for people with a disability, older people, mental health services, palliative care services, addiction services and other health and social care services provided in the community.<\/p>  <p>  The details of the plan are being finalised. It is proposed that the inflation support fund will be administered by the HSE utilising the mechanisms in place for funding eligible organisations in receipt of Service Level Arrangements and Grant Aid Agreements. These arrangements are already in place with organisations that provide key health and social care services for people in Ireland.  It is proposed that payments will be made to eligible organisations in the final quarter of 2022 to meet the pressures of this coming winter. Many eligible organisations may be already operating within a context of increased inflationary pressures.<\/p>  <p>  For providers of long-term residential care who participate in the nursing home support scheme, funding will be allocated through the established mechanism of the Temporary Assistance Payment Scheme. Precise details of the scheme are being finalised and will be communicated in the coming days.<\/p>  <p>  To address strategic workforce challenges in the nursing home and home care sector, a Cross-Departmental Strategic Workforce Advisory Group (SWAG) was established in March 2022 and published a report on October 15th outlining 16 key recommendations spanning the areas of recruitment and retention, pay and conditions and overall sectoral reform. I strongly endorse the Group&rsquo;s recommendations to address the critical shortage of care workers in Ireland and a dedicated Implementation Group will start to progress these immediately.<\/p>  <p>  Funding to support people to access services in the sector continues to be provided in line with the long-established statutory mechanisms under the Nursing Homes Support Scheme Act 2009. This is the mechanism established by the Oireachtas to provide for the processes relating to funding under the NHSS and the negotiation of prices for services for private and voluntary providers with the designated State agency, the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF). Maximum prices for individual nursing homes are agreed with the NTPF following negotiations and based on the NTPF&rsquo;s cost criteria. These criteria include costs reasonably incurred by the nursing home, local market prices, historic prices and overall budgetary capacity. <\/p>  <p>  The NTPF carry out this role independently under the NHSS Act 2009. The NTPF has statutory independence, and there is no role for Ministers or the Department of Health in these negotiations. The Department of Health published a review of the NTPF pricing system in June 2021. It recommended several actions to improve the pricing system which are now being taken forward by the Department of Health and the NTPF.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102500104#WRGG03900","answer":true,"speaker":"1614"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Policies","counter":1839,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102500104#WRGG04000"},{"type":"question","counter":1840,"qnumday":700,"qnumall":"[53491\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102500104#WRGG04100","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when a reply will issue to correspondence from an organisation (details supplied) concerning the WHO Intersectoral Global Action Plan on Epilepsy and other neurological conditions; if he will provide an update on his Department's plans to implement the recommendations of the plan; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1480","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":1841,"content":"<p>As this question refers to operational matters, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the Deputy directly, as soon as possible. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102500104#WRGG04200","answer":true,"speaker":"1484"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Budget 2023","counter":1842,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102500104#WRGG04300"},{"type":"question","counter":1843,"qnumday":701,"qnumall":"[53498\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102500104#WRGG04400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 203 of 12 October 2022, the breakdown of the allocations totalling &euro;107.1 million bundled in line one cost-of-living by item in tabular form.","asker":"1615","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":1844,"content":"<p>Further to Parliamentary Question No. 203 of 12 October 2022, Budget 2023 allocated funding of &euro;254 million to the Department of Health in respect of New Service Developments.

I am referring to the recently published  <i>Shared National Vision for Trees, Woods and Forests in Ireland until 2050 <\/i>which was informed by a series of extensive engagements and consultation. The Vision has informed a new <i>Forestry Strategy for Ireland<\/i>which has been developed by Working Group 2 of Project Woodland.  <\/p><p>In parallel, a draft <i>Forest Strategy Implementation Plan<\/i>has also been developed to facilitate the initial steps in the implementation of the <i>Forest Strategy<\/i>. This Plan comprises a list of actions and measures and includes the Forestry Programme for the period 2023-2027 which will be the main implementation vehicle for the Forest Strategy in the immediate to short term. <\/p><p>The draft<i>Forest Strategy<\/i>and <i>Forest Strategy Implementation Pla<\/i>n were published on Tuesday the 18<sup>th<\/sup>of October and are now subject to a 6-week public consultation process. This means that stakeholders and interested parties are aware of the measures and Schemes that are being proposed for the next Forestry Programme and may submit their feedback on all elements.  <\/p><p>Alongside this public consultation process, my Department is currently engaged in detailed discussions with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to agree funding.  We are also in contact with European Commission and are initiating the process for State Aid approval for the new Programme. <\/p><p>I will publish the financial supports for the new Programme at the earliest opportunity.  In parallel, once the public consultation process has been completed we will take account of submissions received to arrive at a final version.<\/p><p>As regards payment to forestry companies and forest owners, we have to date this year paid out over &euro;61.5 million which is a significant, fully Exchequer funded, investment in forestry. This is broadly in line with payments for the same period in 2021. We will continue to deal with payments in a timely manner, as has been our practice to date.<\/p><p>Specifically, as regards the Frost Reconstitution scheme, approvals are issuing daily. We expect to receive applications for payments from the sector shortly and we will be issuing payments in respect of these applications promptly. We would expect where all requirements are met that there will be no delay in making payment under this scheme and the first payments will be issuing by end of this month.  <\/p><p>In terms of liquidity, I have met the pillar banks this week to highlight clearly that we are about to deliver on a new Forestry Programme and to reiterate how central the forestry sector is to Government policy.<\/p><p>I am firmly committed to introducing a well - funded Forestry Programme which both meets the needs of society and that of the sector, and this will provide guaranteed long-term investment in the sector.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102500106#WRJJ01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1546"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1926,"content":"<p>Question No. 726 answered with Question No. 725.<\/p>"},{"type":"question","counter":1928,"qnumday":727,"qnumall":"[52701\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102500106#WRJJ01600","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the project afforestation forecast for 1 January 2023 to 31 March 2023; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1487","askee":"1546"},{"type":"speech","counter":1929,"content":"<p>The new <i>National Forestry Strategy <\/i>and <i>Forestry Strategy Implementation Plan<\/i>(including the Forest Programme)  has been put out to public consultation and they are available to view now on my Department's website.

The backlog has reduced from 6,000 in August 2021, to 3,700 in January of this year and now stands at 1,639. We are issuing more licences than applications received and this means that the backlog continues to drop, with faster turnaround times for new applicants.<\/p>  <p>  When we published our Forestry Licensing Plan for 2022, we set an ambitious target of 5,250 licences, an increase of 30% on 2021. <\/p>  <p>  We set individual targets across licensing categories. In terms of our targets in the year-to date, as of 21st October, we are at 94% of the target for roads, 89% for private felling and over 100% for Coillte felling. I acknowledge that afforestation figures are not quite keeping pace with other categories and are at 69% of year-to-date target .   <\/p>  <p>  However, the Department received 339 fresh afforestation applications, while 578 afforestation licences have issued. Furthermore, the pace of processing of these applications has picked up significantly, since increased ecological specialist resources have come online with 238 licences processed in the 3rd quarter of this year, compared to 131 in the second quarter. <\/p>  <p>  We are embarking on an intensive effort over the last few weeks and next few weeks to prioritise afforestation with an aim of clearing older files ahead of the new forestry programme.<\/p>  <p>  This improved outputs have been achieved through a commitment to continuous improvement as well as through the implementation of  measures recommended under Project Woodland.<\/p>  <p>  Work is on-going with the implementation of the 57 recommendations arising from a business process review carried out under Project Woodland, with 71% of the recommendations either complete or in progress.  This builds on earlier improvements to our processes. <\/p>  <p>  These improvements have facilitated the preparation of Appropriate Assessment Reports by my Department, which removes this burden from applicants in most cases.  Associated with this and in order to assist foresters in submitting quality applications, we provided habitat map training and training for ecologists.  Furthermore, a pre-application discussion pilot has been completed and we now intend to deliver this at a national level, along with the new Forestry Programme.  <\/p>  <p>  All of these measures are aimed at improving the quality of applications received and optimising the time of those assessing applications.<\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, in tandem with reviewing processes, I have substantially increased the resources available to process forestry licences, and the positive impact of this can be seen in the increased number of licences issuing. <\/p>  <p>  In addition, a legal and regulatory review of forestry licensing was carried out by Philip Lee Solicitors and, following extensive stakeholder engagement, their Report was published in June.  The Project Board for Project Woodland has responded to these recommendations and my Department will now finalise a plan for the implementation of the Report, with a certain number of actions already underway.<\/p>  <p>  This improvement in licence output will remove one of the perceived barriers to planting. I am acutely aware of the afforestation target of 8,000 hectares per year set out in the Climate Action Plan and the fact that afforestation rates have been declining in recent years. <\/p>  <p>  As Deputies will know, the current Forestry Programme provides supports for afforestation including grants and premiums and covers the cost of establishing a forest.  Despite strong support for landowners over a period of 15 years, we have not achieved the level of planting anticipated. We hope that a new Forestry Programme will re-engage landowners, farmers in particular, and realise the land-use change needed.<\/p>  <p>  The draft Forestry Programme 2023 - 2027 forms part of the Implementation Plan for the new Forest Strategy. Both the Strategy and the Implementation Plan are currently undergoing public consultation.<\/p>  <p>  Alongside this public consultation process, my Department is currently engaged in detailed discussions with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to agree funding.  We are also in contact with European Commission and are initiating the process for State Aid approval for the new Programme.<\/p>  <p>  I intend to publish the financial supports for the new Programme at the earliest opportunity.  In parallel, once the public consultation process has been completed, we will take account of submissions received to arrive at a final version.<\/p>  <p>  It is my intention to introduce a programme which will deliver for society, for landowners and for the forestry sector in Ireland. Its objective will be to expand the national forest estate on both private and public land. I hope to incentivise farmers in particular to re-engage with forestry and we hope to offer increases in grants and premiums to enable land-use change. A comprehensive and well-subscribed forestry programme has the potential to deliver lasting benefits for climate change, biodiversity, wood production, economic development and quality of life.   I am confident that once the programme is launched that both public and private actors will support it in order to realise its ambition.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102500106#WRJJ04700","answer":true,"speaker":"1546"},{"type":"question","counter":1961,"qnumday":740,"qnumall":"[52826\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102500106#WRJJ04900","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"his plans to review the current reconstitution and underplanting scheme; his views on complaints from the sector that it is not fit for purpose; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1613","askee":"1546"},{"type":"speech","counter":1962,"content":"<p>I have met with landowners whose forests have ash dieback and I am more than aware of their concerns. <\/p><p>Since the first finding of ash dieback disease in Ireland, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine (DAFM) has provided support totalling over &euro;7 million to owners of ash plantations impacted by ash dieback disease through the ash dieback reconstitution scheme, introduced in 2013, and more recently the Reconstitution and Underplanting Scheme introduced in July 2020.<\/p><p>The current scheme provides 100% grant aid to landowners to clear their ash crop, replant with an alternate species and manage their forest until successfully established.

While there is a very limited quota available for use only in pilot schemes designed to reduce by-catches, any such schemes are subject to European Commission approval and must relate to reducing by-catches of dogfish in other fisheries, i.e. the targeting of dogfish would remain prohibited. <\/p>  <p>  The stock was subject to high harvest rates for more than four decades, and fisheries were not managed during this time.  The species is a long-lived, slow growing and late maturing species and is, therefore, particularly vulnerable to over-fishing.

My Department prepares and publishes an Annual Review and Outlook (ARO), which provides up-to-date information and statistical analysis from a variety of sources, to give a detailed overview of Ireland&rsquo;s agri-food sector and an outlook for the future. I will publish the ARO for 2022 shortly.<\/p><p>Earlier this year, BIM published its Business of Seafood report for 2021.  The report indicated that employment in the seafood sector remained stable in 2021 with approximately 16,650 people employed directly and indirectly within the sector, an increase in overall employment of 1%. <\/p><p>The EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement (TCA) will, unfortunately, have an impact on our fishing industry. However, this impact would have been far greater had the Barnier Task Force agreed to UK demands, or had we been in a no-deal scenario which would have seen all EU vessels barred from UK waters and subsequent displacement into Ireland's fishing zone. <\/p><p>I established the Seafood Sector Task Force in March 2021 to examine the impacts of the TCA on our fishing sector and coastal communities and to make recommendations to me on a mitigation strategy.  I received the Report of the Seafood Task Force in October 2021 and it recommends some 16 support schemes at a cost of &euro;423 million.  One of the recommendations of the Task Force was that a voluntary decommissioning scheme should be implemented to help restore balance between fishing fleet capacity and available quotas, following the reductions in quotas for stocks arising from the EU\/UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement. <\/p><p>I announced the scheme in August and it was opened for applications by BIM in September. The scheme makes &euro;60 million available in funding for those who volunteer to take part of in the scheme and an additional &euro;20 million in tax relief. <\/p><p>In line with the Recommendations of the Task Force, I am also requiring that owners of vessels who choose to participate in the scheme must ensure that crew working on their vessel are compensated for their loss of livelihood following the decommissioning of their vessel. Crew payments can range up to a maximum of &euro;50,000 per individual. <\/p><p>The scheme runs concurrently with a series of schemes aimed at creating jobs in the seafood sector and in coastal communities, including the &euro;45 million Brexit Seafood Processing Capital Scheme, the &euro;20 million Brexit Sustainable Aquaculture Growth Scheme and &euro;25 million Blue Economy Enterprise Development Scheme. In total, &euro;225m in supports and developmental strategies have been announced which will contribute to sustaining employment in the seafood sector as a whole, providing new career opportunities and ensuring those transitioning within the sector are supported.  <i><\/i><\/p><p>In addition to the measures recommended by the Task Force, my Department&rsquo;s &euro;240 million European Maritime and Fisheries Fund (EMFF) Programme 2014-20 has been operating since 2016, supporting the sustainable development of our seafood sector.  The Programme has been providing a wide range of financial supports to fisheries, aquaculture and seafood processing enterprises and to enterprises, groups and individuals in coastal communities.  These include supports for capital investment, innovation, professional advisory services and marketing.  Through these measures, the Programme has been fostering the economic development of the seafood industry and coastal communities, building value and growing exports in these enterprises.

I believe the incoming CAP is a well-funded and farmer-friendly CAP that will support our farm families over the next five years. <\/p><p>A range of measures are included in Ireland&rsquo;s Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) strategic plan to benefit small and medium sized farms: <\/p><p>- Complementary Redistribution Income Support for Sustainability (CRISS), which is often referred to as front loading, is designed to redistribute support towards small and medium sized farms. Member States have an obligation to allocate at least 10% of the Direct Payment fund to CRISS. In Ireland this will result in an allocation of approximately &euro;118 million annually. Farmers will receive payment on their first 30 eligible hectares, redistributing support from larger to smaller or medium-sized farmers. <\/p><p>- The convergence mechanism aims to bring payment entitlement values towards a national average value. Member States must ensure that, by 2026, at the latest, all payment entitlements should have a value of at least 85% of the new national average payment entitlement unit amount. Increases in the value of payment entitlements must be financed by reducing the value of payment entitlements that have values in excess of the national average. <\/p><p>- Ireland&rsquo;s CAP strategic plan also implements new rules on capping of payments, effectively limiting the maximum Basic Income Support for Sustainability (BISS) payment to &euro;66,000. Although it is forecast that relatively few farmers will be affected by this measure, proceeds from capping will be redistributed through CRISS <\/p><p>- The Complementary Income Support for Young Farmers (CISYF) supports young farmers under the age of 40 to establish their farming business. There will be continued prioritisation of young farmers and new entrants for allocations of payment entitlements from the National Reserve. Typically, young farmers commence their farming career with small to medium sized farms, these support measures aim to benefit them. Ireland will dedicate three percent of the Direct Payment envelope annually (circa &euro;35m) to CISYF and qualifying young farmers will benefit by approximately &euro;170 per hectare, up to a maximum of 50 hectares. This is greatly increased from the current payment that is attached to payment entitlements and currently is approximately &euro;68 per entitlement. <\/p><p>- The Eco-Scheme will be implemented annually with an allocation of approximately &euro;297 million. It will provide support to farmers who undertake actions beneficial to the climate, environment, water quality and biodiversity. The Eco-Scheme will be optional for farmers to participate in and unlike greening, the Eco-Scheme will not be linked to payment entitlements and is payable on all eligible hectares that a farmer carries out the required actions ,on whether payment entitlements are held or not.<\/p><p><i>Table 1: Illustrates the 2022 Direct Payment per hectare compared to 2027 Direct Payment, with the percentage change and number of herds per hectare category.<\/i><\/p><p><i><\/i>Table 1 compares the current Direct Payment baseline against the Direct Payment per hectare estimated figures for 2027 and includes the relevant percentage change and the approximate number of herds in each of the categories.<\/p><p>It must be noted that in each category, there are beneficiaries and contributors, and the figure represents an accumulation of amounts within each category. The payment amounts shown in Table 1 are comprised of all Direct Payment schemes.<\/p><p>It should be stated that the modelling exercise used in the CAP Strategic Plan is not an exact forecast and is based around a number of assumptions. The modelling population is static, with the same population used for both the 2022 and 2027 payment estimates, while in reality this population is constantly changing, and this could impact the average value.<\/p><p>Finally, the model assumes full participation for all eligible applicants for all schemes, for example, all active farmers will be eligible to apply for the Eco-scheme regardless of whether they hold entitlements or not and payment will be made on eligible hectares claimed.<\/p><p>A key difference between this new CAP programme and the current programme is the clear environmental and redistribution ambition. <\/p><p>In addition, there is a shift away from dependence on linkages to payment entitlements making payments more accessible to farmers. In combination, these elements support the policy objective to ensure a fairer distribution and efficient targeting of direct payments to those farmers with small and medium sized farms.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102500110#WRNN00800","answer":true,"speaker":"1546"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":2084,"content":"<p>Question No. 783 answered with Question No. 725.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":2085,"content":"<p>Question No. 784 answered with Question No. 739.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":2086,"content":"<p>Question No. 785 answered with Question No. 781.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Trade Promotion","counter":2087,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102500110#WRNN01200"},{"type":"question","counter":2088,"qnumday":786,"qnumall":"[53539\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102500110#WRNN01300","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the extent to which new markets continue to be established for Irish food and food products; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1546"},{"type":"speech","counter":2089,"content":"<p>Continuing to grow market opportunities for dairy, meat and seafood products at home and abroad is a key goal of Food Vision 2030, the overall strategy for the future development of the agri-food sector. <\/p>  <p>  To support the strategic goals of developing and diversifying agri-food export markets, Bord Bia received an allocation of &euro;55m in Budget 2023.
