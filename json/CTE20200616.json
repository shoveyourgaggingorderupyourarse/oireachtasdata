As you noted, Chairman, I am joined today by my council colleagues, Ms Dawn Holland and Professor Michael McMahon, and we are joined in the Chamber by our chief economist, Dr. Eddie Casey, and also by Mr. Kevin Timoney, an economist on the fiscal council.<\/p> <p>  Engagement with the Oireachtas is an extremely important part of the council's work, including with the Committee on Budgetary Oversight in the previous D&aacute;il.  The council is an independent body established under the Fiscal Responsibility Act 2012.  Its mandate is to endorse and assess the Government's macroeconomic forecasts and its budgetary projections, and compliance with the fiscal rules and the fiscal stance.  It is important to note that the council's mandate is about the overall budgetary position rather than on individual tax measures or spending items.<\/p> <p>  The Covid-19 crisis has had a huge impact on Ireland and internationally.  Even in the first three months of the year, consumer spending is down by approximately 5%.  Underlying domestic demand is expected to contract by between 7% and 17% this year.  Approximately 26% of the workforce is currently either unemployed or on pandemic unemployment supports.<\/p> <p>  The council's fiscal assessment report, published on 27 May, provides an assessment of the fiscal impact of Covid-19.  There is exceptionally high uncertainty at the moment about the health outcomes and the economic outcomes.  To assess this, in the fiscal assessment report the council has outlined three scenarios to 2025 to help people's thinking about this.  In the \"mild\" scenario, conditions improve rapidly and lasting damage to the economy is limited.  The \"central\" scenario builds on the official forecasts in the stability programme update, SPU, published by the Government in April.  It is assumed that confinement measures are eased as planned, but with lasting impacts.  In a \"severe\" scenario, there are repeated lockdowns and wider financial distress.  These scenarios do not take into account major risks Ireland faces from Brexit or from corporation tax.<\/p> <p>  In all scenarios, activity falls sharply and the crisis will have a lasting effect.  The scenarios imply it would take two and a half to three years for the economy to return to pre-crisis levels of activity.  By contrast, the economy took 11 years to recover after the financial crisis.<\/p> <p>  In fiscal terms, the budget balance will moves sharply into deficit this year; the SPU projected a deficit of 13% of GNI* this year, reflecting &euro;7 billion of crisis-related spending and a much larger fall in tax revenue.  This likely underestimates the impact on spending because it does not include the extension of support measures or any future fiscal stimulus package.  While the fiscal balance will improve as the economy recovers, the central scenario implies that the deficit could still be approximately 3% of GNI* in 2025.<\/p> <p>  The appropriate fiscal stance in response to this will evolve over the coming years in three broad phases.  In phase 1, the immediate crisis, the Government should limit the negative impacts on health and on the economy.  The council welcomes the measures taken to support the economy.  These should continue as long as needed, although they may need to evolve to reflect changing needs.<\/p> <p>  Phase 2 will be marked by the removal of most of the containment measures and the economy will begin to recover, but investment and consumer spending will remain very weak and unemployment will remain high.  The council assesses that a sizeable fiscal stimulus would be warranted during this phase to help support the recovery.  Borrowing to support weak demand would be an appropriate countercyclical response to manage the economy.  It should be temporary, targeted and conditioned on the likely state of the economy.<\/p> <p>  Public investment could play an important role.  While some reprioritisation may be needed, at least maintaining the current level of spending would help support activity and boost long-term output.<\/p><p>Excess capacity in the construction sector may create opportunities. <\/p><p> In phase 3, the economy will settle into a new steady-state growth path.  At this stage, the debt-to-GNI* ratio will be very high.  The debt ratio could be in the range of 115% to 145% in 2021, up from just below 100% in 2019.<\/p><p> Given the very high level of debt and lower revenues, fiscal adjustment is likely to be required in phase 3 to put the debt-to-GNI* ratio on a downward path towards safer levels.  A key factor is the low level of interest rates.  Even with the higher debt level, interest payments could actually fall over the coming years in the central scenario due to lower interest rates and a favourable tailwind as existing debt is rolled over.  The long maturity of new issuance provides some protection against a rise in rates over the coming years.  However, low interest rates cannot be taken for granted.  Actions by the European Central Bank and the stability of the euro area will be key.  With a very high debt ratio, Ireland will ultimately be much more vulnerable to future changes in interest rates as large amounts of funding will likely be required for new borrowing in the coming years and to roll over existing debt.  This is why it will be very important to use the current positive debt dynamics to bring debt to a safer level. <\/p><p> In terms of future fiscal adjustment, the council's analysis suggests that getting the debt-to-GNI* ratio to fall at a pace of 3% a year by 2025 - similar to previous plans - would require total adjustments ranging from &euro;6 billion to &euro;14 billion over the period from 2023 to 2025.  In the central scenario of around &euro;10 billion of adjustment, this could take place over several years and against the background of a growing economy.  The adjustment would still be less than a third of what was implemented after the 2008 crisis.  This does not mean a return to severe austerity.  Fiscal adjustment will be needed but some upward and downward adjustments, either in aggregate terms or on specific items, are a normal part of budgetary management.  The adjustment could be achieved to a large degree by growing spending at a slower pace than the economy grows.  We do not expect to return to severe austerity in the sense of significant increases in unemployment due to fiscal adjustments taking place in a downturn as Ireland saw after 2008. <\/p><p> Any incoming Government will have to take difficult decisions about competing spending and tax priorities during this third phase against the background of required adjustment.  Any new commitments will likely require reductions in other areas of spending or higher taxes.  Nonetheless, ambitious policies can still be pursued in areas like health, housing and climate change.  Three long-standing issues, however, will need to be addressed.  The first is spending pressures associated with an ageing population.  The council will publish a long-term stability report in July looking at these issues.  Second, additional measures could be needed if Ireland is to meet its climate change commitments.  Third, the State has become over-reliant on corporation tax receipts, which accounted for some 18% of annual tax receipts last year.<\/p><p> To conclude, there are huge uncertainties for the economy depending on health outcomes but the broad phases of the crisis and recovery are relatively clear.  As the economy exits lockdown, a sizeable fiscal stimulus would help recovery.  However, some adjustments are likely to be needed down the line to get the debt ratio on a safe downward path again.  To safeguard the funding of public services and supports in future, while addressing future challenges, the incoming Government should set a credible path for prudent fiscal policy and take steps to reinforce the budgetary framework.  We look forward to members' questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020061600002#B00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Sebastian Barnes","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1592262000,"counter":22,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Barnes.

It does not quite show up in the numbers, but we expect those tax heads to decrease very steeply.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the projection of a deficit of &euro;23 billion included in the SPU, it was a good figure at the time but, as I noted in my opening comments, given that there has been an extension of some of the programmes and that stimulus measures are likely, it is almost certainly an underestimate.  To be fair, spending has been a little bit lower than expected in some areas but I do not believe that will make a great deal of net difference.  The Deputy is right that the deficit figure is likely to be higher than the SPU figure, which was partly allowed for.<\/p><p>In terms of the risk around corporation tax, I would not say that I am more worried than I was when we last spoke six months ago.  Corporation tax can be affected by two things.  One is the state of the domestic economy, which will push down a lot on corporation tax as many companies are facing very hard times.  It will be interesting to see what happens to the multinational sector.  As ever, that is very volatile and hard to predict, but it may be that the multinational sector remains relatively strong.  That would be a good thing at a time other Government revenues are suffering.  However, in the long run, it is not a sustainable solution for financing the public finances.  It will be important, despite all the competing pressures in the years ahead, that the over-reliance on corporation tax is addressed and does not get any worse over the coming years.  I will hand over to Professor McMahon.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020061600002#E00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Sebastian Barnes","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1592262000,"counter":42,"content":"<p>I think we are out of time.

I want to take them through some of the issues in their report and ask a number of questions.  I am getting a lot of calls from people and I am aware of a concern generally about moving into a recessionary period, what that means and how it will contrast with the previous recessionary period, which was difficult for everybody and lasted a long time.  I would like the witnesses' insight into how this is different, the reasons for that and how we work through it.  For example, the report presents a range of scenarios of various severity and implies that it would take two to three and a half years to return to pre-crisis levels of economic activity.  By contrast, the economy took 11 years to recover after the previous financial crisis.  What are the assumptions behind that and the reasons such different periods of recovery are identified?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020061600002#F00400","speaker":"1480"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1592262000,"counter":45,"content":"<p>When trying to assess what type of economic slowdown or recession we are experiencing now, the key thing is to recognise that at least in the first instance, the economic slowdown is itself a public health measure.  Lockdown and isolation of large parts of the economy has been done with the objective of protecting public health.  As a result, it is a very different form of recession from those we have seen in the past.  As we discuss in the report, that does not mean it will not have ongoing effects.  In particular, there are certain sectors of the economy that, even if lockdown were to end in some legal sense, would not adjust back to their previous levels at any speed.  As Mr. Barnes outlined in his opening statement, the report examines three scenarios.  They are not in any way meant to be the only possible scenarios.  There is massive uncertainty about this.  The point we stress about why this would be a faster recovery than we saw after the financial crisis is that, in terms of both household and corporate balance sheets and the fiscal position, Ireland went into this crisis in a much healthier state.  Of course, the challenges that have come from the Covid-19 pandemic are such that large areas of the economy, a broad cross section of industries, and a broad cross section of different types of households have been adversely affected.  That is why in this initial health phase, the \"whatever it takes\" type support the Government has been pursuing is something we absolutely endorse.  How we recover from this will itself depend on some things that are very hard to ascertain.<\/p><p>For instance, at what rate will people decide they are confident enough to go back to shopping in non-essential shops or start to re-engage with the entertainment industries, for example, by going to pubs or restaurants?  How these behavioural responses play out will depend on many aspects that are just very difficult to ascertain.  Nonetheless, across the phases we believe Ireland is pretty well placed so that most of the sectors can recover.  As Mr. Barnes outlined, with some fiscal stimulus in the second phase, that is, in the recovery phase after the initial health impact has been mitigated somewhat, Ireland could be back in approximately two and a half to three years, which, as the Deputy noted, is much faster.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020061600002#F00500","nonspeaker":"Professor Michael McMahon","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1592262000,"counter":47,"content":"<p>The professor stated that the reason is we have gone into this recessionary period with our public finances in a completely different position from where they had been.

The main thing that is striking is that, compared to the previous downturn, we think it will be much less long lived.  It has been much more violent to start with.  Within a process of a few weeks, the economy was locked down.  One could not go to a shop or a restaurant because they were literally closed by Government order.  That is very different to what happened in the financial crisis.<\/p> <p>  During the financial crisis, there was a big drop in demand.  While it was not as sudden as this, it was ultimately much more longer lasting.  It is that point which is going to cause many difficulties for firms, which literally have not been able to operate for a couple of months and may not be able to do business for a while.  That is going to put huge pressure on the SME sector in particular,  which often struggles to get access to finance.

With regard to the value of the stimulus, as I noted earlier, the &euro;10 billion was just an illustrative figure.  It would not surprise me if it were far higher than that but the time to judge how big it should be will be later in the year, particularly around the budget.  It is very uncertain.  As the Deputy acknowledged, there is a huge difference between &euro;10 billion and &euro;22 billion.  I am not taking a view particularly as to which of the figures is correct but the difference is big.  The judgment needs to be made with all the available information at hand.

Taking the central scenario, which might be sensible, phase 1 is really now and in the short term, phase 2 would really be the recovery phase, which would be in the next couple of years, and phase 3, which is the new normal, might be from approximately 2023.  Thinking about it in those terms, one notes the third phase is really a couple of years away.  This corresponds with what we see in the coalition agreement that was published yesterday.  Phase 1 really corresponds to the recovery fund.  One can think about phase 2 as being a national economic programme, to be announced in the autumn and which will apparently have strong elements of investment and stimulus.  Phase 3 really comes down to the roadmap, which will also be announced.  It will set out how the Government intends to return to something close to balance by 2025.

It has increased in recent years as the share of taxation coming from corporation tax has increased.  With regard to how it is managed, there are two matters to consider.  One that we have proposed in the past is that unexpected positive surprises from corporation tax should be set aside and saved rather than spent, which has been the case over recent years.  That is to avoid the State building up permanent spending commitments on the basis of this tax, which is very volatile and may be somewhat fragile.  It also ultimately requires an adjustment to move away from that.  That either involves reductions in spending elsewhere or increases in other forms of taxes to reduce that vulnerability.<\/p><p>One of the vulnerabilities is that the companies themselves might do not do as well or might decide to move somewhere else, which they can do fairly easily.  The other vulnerability is the possibility of changes in the international tax environment, which is partly to do with processes such as the OECD's base erosion and profit shifting, BEPS, process and a number of other discussions.  Ultimately, it is likely that this issue will correct, and it would be good to anticipate that rather than face it as another economic shock like the sorts of shocks we have seen lately.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020061600002#K00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Sebastian Barnes","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1592262000,"counter":84,"content":"<p>To follow up on that point, does IFAC take a view on country-by-country reporting?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020061600002#L00200","speaker":"1559"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1592262000,"counter":85,"content":"<p>No, we do not.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020061600002#L00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Sebastian Barnes"},{"type":"speech","time":1592262000,"counter":86,"content":"<p>Mr. Barnes's second point was that additional measures may be needed if Ireland is to meet its climate change commitments.

Aside from the need for a stimulus package to reboot business, there is a strong argument for investing in and making public services universal, including making housing affordable, as a means of reducing the cost of living.

This is necessary to reduce debt in the way it needs to be reduced given the high and risky level it will be at.  These things are affordable, but there are big question marks around how it is going to be financed.  This is a major shift in the way healthcare is provided.  It is not entirely clear at this point, and the agreement pushes it down the track a bit, how that is going to be financed when big commitments have been made around other aspects of spending, for example, welfare and tax, and particularly not to raise income tax rates which account for approximately one third of taxation.  It can be afforded but it is not very clear.

The programme for government, regarding that period, refers to utilising taxation and expenditure measures to close the deficit, while IFAC refers to phase 3 being a period of fiscal consolidation to bring the debt-to-GNI* ratio down.  It seems to me that IFAC is at pains to avoid describing this as a period of austerity, but I would like to explore that further because on the figures here, unfortunately, it does not seem to me that there are many other conclusions available.<\/p> <p>  The point was made that the adjustment would be significantly less than that implemented after the 2008 crisis.  That is based, however, on looking at the figures over seven years after 2008, versus three years from 2023 to 2025.  If we look at the figures on a year-on-year basis, and the potential for a &euro;14 billion adjustment between 2023 and 2025, that works out as a higher amount of fiscal consolidation - in layman's terms, austerity - than we had post the 2008 crisis.  <\/p> <p>  The opening statement from IFAC goes on to state: \"This does not mean a return to severe austerity.\"  We can debate the adjective later.  The statement continues: \"We do not expect austerity in the sense of significant increases in unemployment due to severe fiscal adjustments taking place in a downturn.\"  IFAC is stating that is not austerity, but then redefines austerity as something that nobody defines it as.  Austerity, as defined by most people, refers to economic measures to close deficits based on increasing taxation or decreasing public expenditure.  That is really what IFAC foresees happening in phase 3 from 2023 to 2025, and, on a year-by-year basis, IFAC sees that process coming in at around a similar amount to the kind of year-by-year austerity we saw from 2008 onwards.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020061600002#O00600","speaker":"1628"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1592262000,"counter":118,"content":"<p>Let me clarify that what we mean by \"fiscal adjustment\" here is exactly that, to close the deficit that would have opened up because incomes are permanently lower, but consumption, even once things like stimulus are unwound, would be at a higher level and there would be a gap, in the central deficit scenario, of 3%.  That gap would need to be closed to get the debt-to-GNI* ratio back on the safer trajectory, and that would require an increase in taxation or measures around spending.  It would not necessarily require spending cuts in nominal terms, but it could, for example, require freezing some forms of spending that would contribute quite a lot to closing that gap.<\/p> <p>  Regarding precise figures, and this may be an imprecision on our part and I apologise for that, we have three scenarios.

What are the witnesses' overall thoughts on the demand side?

The creation of demand in these areas is also why the stimulus in the second phase is very important.

That is important.<\/p> <p>  The actions of the ECB are on two fronts.  One is through supporting the banking system and the ECB has taken important measures to keep open the supply of credit, particularly to corporations.  The other part is the ECB's support for the public debt market in the euro area and that is one of the factors keeping interest rates very low.  In turn, that is one of the factors protecting the Government's ability to borrow and create the fiscal space to undertake stimulus packages and the policy measures that are needed.

In the most recent recession, while businesses were struggling, most were still rolling on.

The cumulative cost of these tax cuts from 2022 to 2025 is between &euro;2.7 billion and &euro;4 billion.

There are big questions on how this is going to be financed.  The council does not have a view as to how that should happen but as my colleague, Professor McMahon, said the options are very simple.  The options are to reduce spending in other areas, to increase the efficiency of spending or to increase taxation in other areas.  However, as important options are being kept off the table, it is going to be very difficult to balance those things and to meet these new spending commitments around housing and health and at the same time maintain fiscal sustainability.  The council has a concern that by making it more difficult the risks to fiscal sustainability have been increased because the temptation may well be to borrow more rather than to raise revenues or cut spending.

We also have to be wary that at the other end of the distribution there are some people who have lost a lot of income, cut consumption and nevertheless their savings have either gone to zero or they have run down their savings.<\/p> <p>  To go back to the earlier answer that I gave, it is very difficult at this stage to know how people will react.  If people have savings when lockdown measures ease will they immediately rush out to spend them?  We do not know exactly how they will react.  Similarly, as Mr. Barnes said earlier, ensuring that the policies are in place to provide supports for those people who maybe do not have savings are going to be particularly important to maintain demand in the economy once we get back towards a more normal situation.<\/p> <p>  Again, without going into a specific policy, when thinking about stimulus, these sorts of issues and targeting measures, for instance, that may encourage spending again in certain sectors, one that was mentioned by one of the Deputies earlier was reducing VAT rates.

From its paper, I gather that the IFAC has three scenarios developed: mild, which would be where conditions improve rapidly and there would be minimum impact; a central scenario, where the confinement measures ease but there is a lasting impact; and severe, where there would be repeated lockdowns and wider financial distress as a consequence.  Is it Mr. Barnes's view, based on this discussion and discussions outside this Chamber, that contingent on how the economy will develop and reboot over the next number of months and years, aside from what he calls financial stimulus which I will discuss later, is the health management and the confidence that we as members of the public will express in our local and, indeed, national economy?  If we do not manage the health aspect of this crisis well enough, we will be looking at the third scenario of repeated lockdowns, a significant financial impact, etc.  Equally, if we as members of the public do not express enough confidence to go to the local hotel, restaurants, pubs or whatever the case might be, then the economy will lose.  Does Mr. Barnes agree with the importance of health management and behavioural economics - confidence of the public - and how best does one get that message out?

Central bankers and the European Central Bank in particular would not view the price of specific goods going up, even by a lot, as a particularly worrying measure of inflation.  It is a relative price change reflecting the demand.  Measuring inflation is already very difficult during this current period because a number of goods that form part of the normal basket that goes into inflation are no longer being traded.  That makes the pure measurement of it very difficult.  It is even difficult to go month to month to realise how prices are really evolving at the true, underlying level.  The Deputy's question may have been getting at whether we should worry about inflation.  I certainly think in this first phase, the actions of the ECB and most central banks around the world have reflected the fact that at this moment, even if it were to tick up a little bit, inflation is not the main enemy.  The objective is to keep the economy ticking over to the best possible extent, as some of the other Deputies have mentioned, to ensure that SMEs are there to re-employ workers when lockdown measures are eased, to ensure that shops can reopen and people have somewhere to spend any money that they have.  At this moment, inflation is not where central banks should be particularly worried.  In the past few years, central banks have, if anything, been under-achieving on their inflation targets.  A small move up towards them is not necessarily a bad thing.

The Franco-German proposal on issuing bonds together in Europe is extremely significant and it is very important for Ireland.  In the short run, the impact may not be enormous.  Interest rates are so low and the ECB is being very active in the bond market.  It adds an additional channel of financing but, as Dr. Casey said, it is not clear how much Ireland will get out of it in the short run.  It is important but it is not hugely significant.  What I think is important is the commitment that lies behind it.  In 2008, we saw what happens when there are doubts about euro area countries standing behind each other in a position of crisis.  When the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council was set up, the bond spread was 14 percentage points on Irish Government debt.  That is one of the reasons we had austerity.

Two factors are important.  Unlike in 2008, when Ireland was a particularly weak country that attracted particularly negative focus from the markets, Ireland is now kind of in the same boat as all the other countries.  The Covid crisis has impacted Ireland like many other countries and so it is not suffering from a particular weakness, as it was in 2008.<\/p> <p>  The other matter that is important for the medium term is that one benefit for Ireland is that it is likely that its medium-term growth rate will be quite a lot higher than that of many other countries.  That partly reflects its demographics and partly reflects its productivity performance.  Ireland's ability to get its debt down, if interest rates stay as low as they are, is likely to be greater than that of most other countries in the euro.  That is a very positive aspect for Ireland in the medium run, assuming somewhat higher levels of growth than those of most other countries can be achieved.  Growing the economy is very important, whether through stimulus or long-term investments in skills and all the measures needed to make the economy work.  Ireland benefits from relatively favourable debt dynamics, even if it may be starting from a relatively high debt level.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020061600002#Z00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Sebastian Barnes"},{"type":"speech","time":1592262000,"counter":197,"content":"<p>Mr. Barnes mentioned demographics.

Dr. Casey might outline the numbers.  Migration may be disrupted for a while because of the Covid crisis but in the longer run we assume it will carry on.  A key aspect of migration in Ireland is that it amplifies growth.  In periods where growth is high, migration tends to be much stronger and there is much bigger impulse, whereas in periods where growth is weak, migration tends to produce an adjustment mechanism as an outflow or some adjustment on migration.  Much will depend on the underlying growth potential of the economy, but Dr. Casey might give a sense of the numbers in terms of how much is coming from a natural increase and from migration.  We should bear in mind that migrants are typically of working age and migration is one factor that keeps people in the workforce, which is an important effect.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020061600002#Z01000","nonspeaker":"Mr. Sebastian Barnes"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1592262000,"counter":201,"content":"<p>I would not overstate the importance of migration.

We are talking about net flows.  The important thing to note about flows of migrants is that it varies a lot with the cycle.  In good times, we see a lot of inward migration, as Mr. Sebastian Barnes said.  In bad times, we see a lot of outward migration in net terms.  Over the course of the business cycle, it might end up being close to zero on average.  What really determines the long-run costs associated with ageing is actually the rate of natural births and natural ageing in the population.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020061600002#AA00100","nonspeaker":"Dr. Eddie Casey"},{"type":"speech","time":1592262000,"counter":204,"content":"<p>I thank you all for your time this morning and for answering all of the questions from me and all of the committee members.
