With channel depths of up to 32 m, it handles the largest vessels entering Irish waters and has capacity to handle more than 11 million tonnes per annum.  Its activities have a trade value of &euro;8.5 billion per annum supporting 3,900 jobs.  It is noteworthy that both EU and national policies, including the national development plan, endorse the strategic importance of Shannon Foynes Port Company.  Shannon Foynes is a tier 1 port of national strategic importance under national ports policy.  In addition, under the EU&rsquo;s TEN-T guidelines, two of its core corridors, the Atlantic and the North Sea Alpine, have been extended to include Shannon Foynes.  To date, Shannon Foynes has made several funding applications under the TEN-T funding budget, known as the Connecting Europe Facility, receiving grant aid of around &euro;10 million supporting studies and works of more than &euro;40 million.  Importantly, the Shannon Estuary has a number of sites, extending to a total of 1,200 ha., adjoining deepwater zoned for maritime development, making it ideally suited for future national port infrastructure of scale for this country.<\/p> <p>  To fully realise these comparative advantages, expansion and development of the port is led by its 30-year master plan, Vision 2041.  We are currently updating Vision 2041 to holistically plan for the future port infrastructure required to support Atlantic offshore renewable energy, ORE.<\/p><p>Shannon Foynes has identified the following core growth areas in our strategic plans: establishing the Shannon Estuary as an ORE hub for supply chain location for floating offshore wind; facilitating alternative fuel trans-shipment and production of hydrogen and ammonia, for example, on the Shannon Estuary; establishing a logistics hub and global trans-shipment facility at Foynes for intermodal or unitised cargoes or both; organic growth; and implementing the Limerick docklands strategy.<\/p><p> The first two core areas are relevant to today&rsquo;s meeting and, accordingly, this presentation will focus on those areas.  Due to our proximity to the Atlantic wind resources, considered the best in Europe, and quantified at up to 80 GW, our objective is to develop the Shannon Estuary as a marshalling and operations and maintenance port.  Large-scale port infrastructure, together with associated supply chain infrastructure, is required if Ireland, and indeed Europe, is to meet its climate action targets by 2030 and reach net zero by 2050.  The scale of industrialisation required to achieve this goal should not be underestimated.  For example, commentators estimate that more than &euro;100 billion of floating wind farm investment could be accommodated in our exclusive economic zone, EEZ, over the short, medium and long term.  To enable this potential offshore investment of &euro;100 billion, Shannon Foynes commissioned a report that found &euro;12 billion in supply chain investment will locate in its harbour, the Shannon Estuary, by 2050.<\/p><p> To facilitate this investment, our plans include the development of an ORE assembly and marshalling facility at a new Foynes deepwater terminal.  It is estimated to cost &euro;350 million and to be completed by 2028, thereby enabling the deployment of floating wind projects by the end of this decade.  Allied to the ESB&rsquo;s ambitions for Moneypoint, this will mean two large-scale facilities will be fully operational in the Shannon Estuary by 2030.  The update of our master plan, Vision 2041, will be completed by quarter 3 of this year, and it covers the entire Shannon Estuary.  This update will provide a collaborative roadmap of the ORE requirements for the duration of the plan.  Encompassed in the plan as well is identification of port connectivity requirements for the ORE industry, including the completion of the Limerick to Foynes road scheme, the reopening of the Foynes to Limerick rail line to connect the port with the national rail network, consistent with Irish Rail&rsquo;s Rail Freight 2040 Strategy, the upgrading of fibre-optic connectivity to support large-scale supply chain requirements, and the identification of offshore grid connectivity points in the Shannon Estuary.  An enterprise hub at Shannon Foynes for the co-location of the ORE supply chain on the Shannon Estuary is also included in the plan, as is an educational cluster to support an industry-led research and development working group, and a curriculum working group, facilitated by the universities.  This cluster will focus on developing the next generation of talent and skills for the sector within the Shannon Estuary.  Relevant stakeholder engagements will also form part of the plan.<\/p><p> Considering the distinct competitive advantage of Ireland&rsquo;s Atlantic floating wind resources, Ireland has the potential to produce significant amounts of green hydrogen.  Now more than ever, there is a case for Ireland to increase its floating offshore wind ambition and to accelerate a green hydrogen industry to support national climate action objectives.  Ireland needs to act fast to ensure the potential is captured, and the Shannon Foynes Port Company believes supporting floating wind as part of the phase 2 designation process is critical to this.<\/p><p> Shannon Foynes is implementing its plans to support the growth of floating offshore wind and green hydrogen production and understands from the sector that it is imperative the scope of phase 2 is broadened beyond grid-connected offshore wind; that at least 10 GW should be reserved for a competitive floating preference category in the marine area consent, MAC, process; that the route to market is progressing fast for green hydrogen and alternative fuels derived from floating offshore wind; that Ireland needs to act fast to ensure the hydrogen and alternative fuel export opportunity is realised, and the prioritisation of a hydrogen strategy for Ireland is central to this; and that financing avenues for ORE-related port infrastructure could and should be refined further.<\/p><p> I thank the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022032200002#A00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Pat Keating","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1647907200,"counter":8,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Keating for his statement.  This part of the meeting is confined to one hour, so I propose that each member of the committee takes two minutes to address questions to the witnesses.  That will ensure we get through all the questions.  We may then have time for a second and third round of questions.<\/p> <p>  When we talk about the west coast offshore potential, we are really talking about Ireland starting to play a role in providing clean energy for Europe and the global market.  Given the crisis we have in Europe, it is all the more pertinent now that we figure out how to do this as quickly as possible.  We organise these sessions thinking very much along the lines of our climate obligations, but what is happening in Ukraine now and the resulting energy security crisis has put our work centre stage.  It is a coincidence the witnesses are here today because this meeting was scheduled before things kicked off in Ukraine.  Nevertheless, though, the presence of Mr. Keating and Mr. Hallissey is very timely, as was the attendance of our witnesses in previous weeks and as will be the appearance of our other witnesses in the weeks to come.<\/p> <p>  Will Mr. Keating and Mr. Hallissey talk about the bigger opportunity in this regard?  Shannon Foynes will play a role in bringing in energy from offshore wind resources to Ireland to meet our own needs.  Our witnesses have forged a vision and a path that looks to that bigger scale of development that is possible.  We used to talk about this aspect as a post-2030 opportunity, because that was what we used to see as being the realistic timeline.  With everything going on now, though, not least the climate crisis but also the energy security crisis, it seems we need to accelerate and expedite the existing potential.  Shannon Foynes Port, along with the Port of Cork, will play a crucial role in realising this endeavour.<\/p> <p>  Will the witnesses speak about this larger perspective and what is required to realise the potential in this regard?  I note Mr. Keating stated in his concluding remarks that it was \"imperative the scope of phase 2 is broadened beyond grid-connected offshore wind\".  He is talking about producing green hydrogen and ammonia, offshore or onshore, not for conversion to electricity here but for transport overseas.  It is an interesting and exciting idea.  Perhaps Mr. Keating can speak to this bigger opportunity and say how realistic he thinks it is, how quickly he considers it can be achieved and what needs to be done to achieve that outcome.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022032200002#B00200","speaker":"1594"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1647907200,"counter":9,"content":"<p>Looking at the scale of the resource, at 80 GW, and considering the current grid size demand in Ireland is approximately 5.5 GW, that is less than 10%.  What we have is a huge natural energy resource that is too big for local demand in the Irish market.  It is therefore a pan-European play.  The question we need to ask ourselves as a country is how we can bring that 80 GW into play and assist in decarbonising not only our own economy but also that of Europe, while also feeding into security of supply.  We must start from that point and then look at whether our approach is conducive to unlocking the full 80 GW right now.  The answer is it probably is not.  We have geared the unlocking of our offshore resources based on looking at local Irish demand, while perhaps forgetting the elephant in the room of major European demand.<\/p><p>If we look at it from a pan-European perspective, it brings more urgency to unlocking the resource.  Perhaps some of this has been lacking to date.  We are looking to increase the pace of the processes that are being implemented.  No one in the industry has any issue with the processes that are being adapted or modelled, only the pace of implementation.  A sequential approach is being take to unlocking our offshore renewable resources to meet the 5 GW target by 2030.  This is based on local demand but, in our view, it is inconsistent with where the sector is going, that is, floating offshore.  In Scotland and elsewhere in the UK, the industry is moving apace.  It has ditched the sequential approach and is considering going straight to floating.  In Scotland, two thirds of applications are for floating - 74 applications, with the 16 successful applicants paying option fees of &pound;700 million.  This is the type of initial revenues that can be generated.<\/p><p> The Shannon Foynes Port Company has one of Ireland's other great resources, namely, the Shannon Estuary and its deepwater portal areas.  We have our natural 80 GW resource side-by-side with the deep waters of the Shannon Estuary.  They go hand in glove.  One of the key criteria for unlocking the resource, apart from getting our strategic planning and our consent process right, is having sufficient deepwater port infrastructure to enable the deployment of the offshore floating wind farms in the first place.  The scale of industrialisation in this context cannot be underestimated.  If we are looking at 80 GW over the long term, it means an investment of &euro;100 billion in today's money.  Our report has shown that, in order to install a supply chain to support that investment, up to &euro;12 billion will be required up to 2050.  In referring to the supply chain, we are talking about facilities to build out the various components for the floating wind farms.  Proximity is important because that electricity will have to compete at auction.  The levelised cost of energy, or the cost of production of that electricity, is important.  Therefore, the closer one's deepwater port infrastructure is to one's wind farms, the better.  It cuts down on the transport costs of large-scale devices.  In order for the Shannon Estuary to play a role, we need to ensure that we have the appropriate deepwater facilities to provide the location for that supply chain - fabrication yards for wind farm floating platform construction, cabling, anchoring systems, etc.  The closer such facilities are to the wind farms, the more competitively and greenly we can handle the wind farms' manufacturing.  This is important.<\/p><p> I mentioned 80 GW, but who will use it?  Much of the demand for it will be non-Irish grid and could go into the production of alternative fuels, such as hydrogen and ammonia.  In planning the delivery of green energy for Europe, one of the shortcomings of our current maritime area of consent, MAC, process is that it ties Irish grid connectivity to a MAC.  This is not consistent if we want to develop this resource for the production of alternative fuels, given that such production does not need an onshore grid connection.  This is one of the reasons we have stated that the MAC process should be opened up to floating offshore in order to facilitate investment in alternative fuel production.  We have spoken to a number of interested parties, particularly from Germany.  As the Chairman knows, the market is very active in the hydrogen oil space.  Ireland lacks a couple of elements at the moment, although some of them are on the way, for example, a hydrogen policy.  The demand is real.<\/p><p> We have a definitive resource in the 80 GW.  It is not like oil and gas where we would have to go off, explore and spend a great deal of money only to perhaps get nothing.  This resource of 80 GW plus is undisputed.  We also have more than a route to market for the energy, in that there is a demand case to be made for it as well, be it local demand or export to Europe via alternative fuels.  Normally in a business case, these are two of the main parts of the equation.  In this situation, they are definitive.<\/p><p> The challenge for Ireland is how to get there and implement.  The first part of implementation is the legislative consent process, which we want changed, to fast-track floating offshore.  This is important from a port perspective.  To get the new deepwater jetty I mentioned, we will have to spend &euro;350 million.  Our timeline is to have planning for that by 2024 or 2025.  In the later stages, we will be engaging in financing strategies for that.  If auctions are not available for the market to interact and start planning for floating offshore wind farms, and if there is no definitive market out there, our infrastructure will be delayed because we will not be able to finance it.  If Ireland has not opened the market for floating offshore, potentially run auctions or have a hydrogen policy strategy pricing mechanism in place, the market itself will not be able to complete its business case to develop this floating offshore.  Given lead-in times of up to seven or ten years, everything will get backed up and what is widely noted as the best resource in Europe, if not the world, will become uninvestable.  Consider everything that is happening - decarbonisation requirements, net zero by 2050 and security of supply issues.  This resource is available to us and the technology and know-how exist now.  The hurdle is how the country looks at developing this resource.  The pace of unlocking the 80 GW is the issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022032200002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Pat Keating","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1647907200,"counter":11,"content":"<p>I am mindful of the time and I know that other members wish to contribute, but I thank Mr. Keating for his thorough answer.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022032200002#C00200","speaker":"1594"},{"type":"speech","time":1647907200,"counter":12,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Keating for his presentation.  I will ask two brief questions, the first of which is on ports policy.  When I raised this matter with the Minister of State at the Department of Transport before Christmas, she spoke about a multi-port approach and different things being done at different ports depending on the environment.  Are we in the right place with that policy?  I have heard some people argue that we should designate ports and move ahead with identified ports.  What is Mr. Keating's sense of national ports policy and the development of the Shannon Foynes Port?<\/p> <p>  The Shannon Foynes Port Company has identified a future role in the marshalling, operations and maintenance of offshore wind farms.  Did this come on the back of some consideration by the company?  Did it rule out other elements of the industry?  Why did it land on this role instead of manufacturing or the like?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022032200002#C00300","speaker":"1507"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1647907200,"counter":13,"content":"<p>Regarding the Deputy's first question, the Minister for Transport released an updated policy statement in December that called for a multi-port approach.  He has examined extending and expanding the Connecting Europe Facility to fund future port investments in respect of offshore renewables.  A multi-port approach is a good one to take.<\/p><p>The resource is so large.  To return to the scale of what is required, there is no port in Ireland that is large enough to do this alone.  We are not really competing against other ports.  There is room in this for everyone, given the scale.  In any event, the market will examine the comparative advantages of each individual port.  It will be like any site evaluation.  It will include the likes of us and, potentially, the Port of Cork for floating offshore, with our deep harbours, plentiful supply of water storage, wet storage and existing deepwater port facilities.  We have a supply chain that has already been built up for large-scale shopping.  We have significant comparative advantage in that regard.<\/p><p> The funding aspect, from a ports policy point of view, needs to be refined further and there is no dispute in that regard.  The Department of Transport has set up a co-ordination group among ports for the sector.  The funding is one issue that relates to the time delay.  For example, we know we will have to have new deepwater facilities available by 2030, and the facilities will have to have been built before the industry starts using them.  There is a timing funding gap that needs to be addressed.  Ports are commercial bodies that base their investment appraisals on what is called the financial credit value adjustment, CVA. There is room to bring in a socioeconomics CVA because the benefits of putting that port facility in place are broader than just those relating to the port finances.  There is also the enabling of that &euro;100 billion investment of offshore platforms.  That will happen, but the multi-port approach is the way to go.<\/p><p> On the marshalling port question, our development and plans are guided by our master plan, which was first published in 2013.  We called out offshore renewables as a potential then.  Our approach is to create port facilities and we have a multi-site approach to this.  It is not just Foynes but also Moneypoint and other zoned sites on the Shannon Estuary.  We bring them all into play and provide a multi-site solution.  In some areas, there might be supply chain fabrication yards, while other sites might have electrolysers for hydrogen and ammonia production.  That is why we are updating our master plan.  We have appointed an international company, Bechtel, which is a global leader in port infrastructure development and energy development, to assist us on that and to provide a full, holistic plan for how we can sustainably develop the Shannon Estuary to accommodate this huge resource.  It is about the supply chain.  We will not see any wind farms on the Shannon Estuary.  The supply chain will enable wind farms to develop and then we can, potentially, bring that power ashore to produce hydrogen, ammonia or alternative fuels.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022032200002#C00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Pat Keating","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1647907200,"counter":15,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Keating for the excellent presentation.  This is a significant export opportunity, as he rightly outlined, and it is pan-European infrastructure we are building.  I have a few basic questions.  Who are our competitors in respect of delivering Europe's needs in this sphere?  How should the cost be shared for the development of a pan-European infrastructural project of this nature?  It sounds as though Ireland has some responsibilities, perhaps in priming the pump, if I can use that phrase, and in having a grid option that will facilitate this.  Should it fall on the State to deliver the construction of the significant necessary infrastructure we are talking about or should it fall on private investors, which no doubt have the capacity to build and contemplate the running of these technologies, to do so?  Should there be a European-wide strategy similar to the TEN-T European-wide networks, as Mr. Keating mentioned earlier, where Europe plays a part?<\/p> <p>  If we go beyond what is a domestic need, whereby the gigawatt projection to 2030 is based on what we can provide into our own grid or through interconnectors for onward selling, will that become a significant cost on the State?

For this floating offshore resource, the main competitor is currently the UK, which has two options for floating offshore up and running, namely, ScotWind and another off north Wales.  The risk of those, with Ireland behind the curve by at least five or six years, is that supply chain investment will decide to locate to Scotland before Ireland.  Given the scale of the investment required, even in respect of the supply chain, with fabrication yards and so on, it is probably a once-in-25-years investment decision.  If we lose it, therefore, the risk to Ireland, notwithstanding the remarks we made earlier about transport, is that the supply chain will locate outside of Ireland and we will end up with a commodity resource rather than a value-added resource.  We can learn a great deal from how the UK has approached this and what it has done through its crown estate and so forth.<\/p> <p>  As for who will pay for all this, I am not a pricing expert by any means but the crown estate's approach has been to ask how the supply chain and the wind developers propose to build out their supply chain as part of their option process.  Much can be gleaned from how the auction is set up and we can determine where the supply chain will, potentially, be located.  As I said following the Minister's statement before Christmas, we should seek engagement with Europe to extend the Connecting Europe facility to include the funding of port infrastructure, which is 50% for studies or preliminary works and 30% for capital expenditure work.  On the capital expenditure side, there has already been some sharing of the investment cost.  There is no facility in Ireland for ports to apply to for such funding.  It is through the pricing auction mechanisms that the costings can be shared.<\/p> <p>  In light of the level of bids for open auctions in the UK, and ScotWind in particular, the private sector is queuing up to fund this.  The most recent auction comprised 74 applicants and there were 16 successful applicants, so it was totally oversubscribed.  This is a queue of private sector money and there is a transition out of oil and gas among major companies into this space.  The costs will, ultimately, be taken up by the sector but it is a question of timing.  If we have to deliver large port capital expenditure in particular, we need it upfront.  There is a timing issue there and the sector will pay for that capital expenditure as it consumes it over the long term.  That is the funding gap we have to resolve for the ports.  It is definitely doable, but it will need a bit of thought.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022032200002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Pat Keating"},{"type":"speech","time":1647907200,"counter":17,"content":"<p>I welcome our guests.

We have not got a history of this in Ireland so it was very important, a year and a half ago at this stage, that we set up the education cluster primarily focused on the University of Limerick but with connectivity into Munster Technological University, the Technological University of the Shannon and the National Maritime College of Ireland.  It was all about trying to put the requirements in place, including that connectivity to industry and other education institutions abroad that would be able to help us deliver the courses that will be required in future for today's school-leavers to have an ambition when it comes to offshore wind.<\/p> <p>  I spoke yesterday with Irish people abroad.  When they wanted to get into offshore energy, they had to go away and never had an opportunity to come home.  They went off, be it to Norway, Australia or wherever, did their coursework, got their jobs abroad and that was the end of it.  We are putting together the requirements for each career profile through the curriculum working group we have put in place.  That in turn will assign the opportunity.  It might be a case of, let us say, an electrical engineer doing a number of semesters in Ireland who can then travel abroad to finish off the piece that would be required for offshore installation.  Those young people who do those courses and do that travelling - we all wanted to do a little travelling in our time - have the opportunity, for the first time ever for that generation, to come back and have their job at home in the industry that will be evolving here.  The curriculum working group is working well in defining those career paths and what is required.<\/p> <p>  The research and development working groups are working closely with industry to see what it will require as it moves forward.  The perfect example of that is only last week I was at the University of Limerick, which is printing wind turbine blades and has a curing process.  It will take a while to scale up to the size that will be required in the Atlantic, but that is what is happening at this stage.  It is that connectivity with industry that will be required into the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022032200002#E00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jerry Hallissey"},{"type":"speech","time":1647907200,"counter":21,"content":"<p>I also mentioned fibre-optic connectivity and grid connectivity.

A big part of the work relates to that.  I am sure the Deputy is more than aware that a big part of the work in respect of the onshore grid relates to the two large fossil fuel stations on the Shannon Estuary.  One is at Moneypoint, which is 918 MW, and the other at Tarbert Island is 650 MW.  Those two stations are due to convert throughout this decade.  There is, potentially,1.5 GW or 1.6 GW connectivity already in place on the Shannon Estuary, which is important.  There is existing onshore grid connectivity.

Having been in Scotland and spoken to some of the companies involved, it is clear that a pipeline is very important for companies in order to be able to invest.  Do our guests have thoughts on that?  I refer to the importance of us not just focusing on what is there at the moment but actually doing everything in tandem so that we have short-, medium- and long-term plans.  That is needed not just in order to get it done but also because it is what investors require to be able to invest in Ireland in the short term.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022032200002#E00600","speaker":"1693","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1647907200,"counter":25,"content":"<p>I will address the Senator's first question and then hand over to Mr. Hallissey to deal with the question on rail freight.  As regards our intentions for the marshalling facility to 2028, that is stage 1, if you like.  As I stated, the scale of this is so large that it will require a multi-site approach.  The ESB has the Moneypoint site, so there is potential to have two deepwater facilities ready and available on the Shannon Estuary by 2030.  For the full 80 GW realisation, however, which is in the medium and long term, two will not be enough.  We do have several other sites on the estuary that we are considering.<\/p> <p>  As regards the Senator's question in respect of speed, she is spot on.  Investors need certainty.  We need a pipeline.  The lead times for this infrastructure on the port side but also on the wind farms side are seven to ten years.  That is the type of window we need.  That is why the ask today is to bring floating offshore wind front and centre of the stage right now.  We cannot leave it until 2030.  If we do so, we will not be ready to invest until 2038 or thereabouts because, as members are aware, the way it works is that when we go to fund our infrastructures, our funders will seek certainty.  If there are no options for megawatts or gigawatts on Atlantic floating offshore wind generation, there will no demand even though we have the resource.  That is why it is critical that the pace for floating offshore wind has to move up.  As we pointed out, that 10 GW needs to be now put in for floating offshore wind to give certainty to the sector to be able to plan against.  At the moment, there is nothing there, so even though there is potential for 80 GW, there is no process to engage the market.  That is why it is critical to speed up in the context of floating offshore wind generation.  We kind of need to ditch the 2030 target of 5 GW.  It is a local demand but this is a pan-European play and, in our view, it is not being considered in the right way.  It is a bit like the tail wagging the dog.  The big resource here is 80 GW, not 5 GW.  What do we need to do to unlock 80 GW?  We need to get floating offshore wind generation off the ground and facilitate it.  The market is more than willing, as we have seen in Scotland where it is totally oversubscribed.  As  a country, we need to catch up with the market, set the stage and allow the market to engage with our system.  We agree that is the right approach; the problem is the pace of the roll-out.

The potential is there.  We have all identified what it is.  Only last weekend, the Global Wind Energy Council released a report that put Ireland front and centre as one of the pacemakers for offshore renewable energy in the next decade or beyond.  The opportunity is there; it is about what we can do and the value we can add for ourselves across the board.  If we miss the opportunities, the supply will be sourced elsewhere.  Mr. Keating referred to the UK being our competition.  The North Sea and ScotWind developments are potentially taking from our route to market for the product that is there in the Atlantic.  It is important that we engage with that.<\/p> <p>  It also brings with it the opportunity to assist ourselves.  There is potential to manufacture green fertilisers in Ireland, for example.  The production of green ammonia can be brought to Ireland and that would assist farmers.<\/p> <p>  There is also potential in another area.  This leads into my answer on the rail aspect of things.  It is all interlinked.  If we get global refuelling of shipping, let us say, that brings with it the potential to create a global trans-shipment hub that would shorten supply chain routes for Irish exporters and importers on their routes to market.  We are trying to bring all this forward.  If those supply chain routes are altered and moved elsewhere, we will miss that opportunity.  As part of that, rail connectivity to the port is paramount.  We are a strong advocate for not just the reopening of the Foynes to Limerick rail line that connects us with the national rail network, but also the developmental potential for the distribution hubs proposed as part of the Irish Rail developmental plan for rail freight. There is potential to assist in decarbonising Dublin by taking the likes of cargo from the west of Ireland down the western rail corridor to be exported out of a port in the west of Ireland.  It is about the overall solution.

That is the way the State has approached it in latter times.  Across Europe, the private sector has been more than willing to step up to the plate to invest in this, which says that this is a commercial enterprise and the State need not necessarily be involved in the investment side, but obviously it has to be involved on the regulatory side.  That is the approach as we see it.  There is significant private sector interest from large, global, multinational companies to invest and to unlock this potential resource.  The State's role would be, as I said, more regulatory.  The State can gain significant new revenue streams from this resource.  It can be creative in how it does that.  For example, in the UK, the Crown Estate generates revenues and pays dividends back into the UK Exchequer on an annual basis.  Perhaps the maritime area regulatory authority, MARA, when established, could be given a commercial as well as a regulatory mandate and follow the Crown Estate as an example.  There is a role for the State in this but much of the big money investment can be and will be made by the private sector.<\/p> <p>  Shannon LNG is a hugely topical issue.  The Europeans have in their taxonomy included both gas and nuclear energy as part of the transition.  There is ongoing debate on LNG in Ireland as part of security of supply.  The Shannon LNG application is before An Bord Plean&aacute;la for adjudication later this year.  Again, it is a question of how the country and, maybe, the committee sees the role of gas as part of the transition.  Broadly speaking, it is well accepted that gas will be required as a transition.  The issue is whether that gas can be LNG, which can be natural gas or fracked.  The main issues around LNG in this country are probably on the fracked piece.  There is a project on the Shannon Estuary, with planning live with An Bord Plean&aacute;la.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022032200002#G00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Pat Keating"},{"type":"speech","time":1647907200,"counter":38,"content":"<p>My colleague, Deputy Christopher O'Sullivan, is unable to attend and has sent his apologies.

It describes the benefits of energy storage and raises the challenges and issues which need to be resolved so that it can make its key contribution to Ireland meeting its 2030 and 2050 targets.<\/p> <p>  Decarbonising electricity requires significant additional wind and solar generation and the phasing out of fossil fuel generation, with natural gas used largely as a transitional fuel until decarbonised biogas, green hydrogen or other measures come on stream.  There are two main challenges to operating the grid primarily on wind and solar power.  The first relates to grid stability.  Up to now, big heavy fossil fuel-driven turbines and generators have had enough momentum to ride through the bumps.  We now need to replace these with plant that can respond very quickly, going from zero to full output in a fraction of a second.  The second challenge relates to the variable output from wind and solar generation.  This variability creates the need for plant which can absorb energy when there is too much wind or solar generation to make up the deficit when there is insufficient wind and solar power to meet the demand. <\/p> <p>  On the role of energy storage, batteries with, for example, half an hour's worth of storage can provide a very fast response to provide grid stability.  Plant capable of storing 350 MW is currently in operation and this capacity is expected to rise to 600 MW by 2023, which shows that the energy storage industry can deliver and is delivering.  The variability in output from wind and solar generation can be managed by using different technologies offering different durations of storage.  These include different types of batteries, pumped hydro storage like that used at Turlough Hill and compressed air or liquid air energy storage.  These can provide output for up to 12 hours, which would cover most variations in wind and solar output.<\/p> <p>  Green hydrogen storage is seen as the main solution in the medium term for periods of longer duration when there is little or no wind for days, or even a couple of weeks, because of high pressure over Ireland.  There will be a residual role for gas in the rare periods when low wind generation resulting from high pressure results in excess demand that exceeds green hydrogen storage capacity.  Such periods occur approximately once every ten years.  One of the biggest constraints on meeting the 2030 targets is the provision of sufficient grid connections.  Strategically located energy storage can relieve grid congestion, remove constraints and obviate the need for some upgrades and can therefore contribute to the earlier provision of more grid connections. <\/p> <p>  On non-electricity forms of storage, thermal storage also has a role to play through mediums such as district heating and thermal storage at domestic and commercial levels.  There is a role for green hydrogen, as I have mentioned, and natural gas will have a residual role in supporting the integration of hydrogen.  There are also significant roles for biomethane and optimising the gas infrastructure to receive and transmit energy from clean, nonfossil generated gas.  Local energy supply chains from clean energy sources can play a particular role in decarbonising our culture.<\/p> <p>  How much energy storage is needed?  The Irish Energy Storage Association, IESA, commissioned a report by AFRY called The Missing Link &ndash; the value of energy storage in the AllIsland market.  This report was circulated to the committee in January of this year.  It concluded that 1,900 MW of energy storage will be needed by 2030.  This is almost double the capacity proposed under current plans.  On other added benefits of energy storage, the AFRY report concluded that this 1,900 MW of energy storage would provide: a low-emissions source of firm capacity replacing fossil-fuelled peaking and standby plant; a reduction in curtailment; a reduction in emissions; a net benefit of &euro;34 million per annum; and a reduction in the public service obligation levy of &euro;10 million to &euro;14 million per annum.<\/p> <p>  My final point is on energy security.  To decarbonise electricity, we must replace fossil-fuelled standby and peaking plant.  Energy storage can be used instead.  This also has the benefit of reducing curtailment of wind.  Markets must provide investment signals for this sector.  The current market for delivering a secure sustainable electricity system, or DS3, services, which are used to stabilise the grid, is based on tariff rates which are paid when the plant is available.  This market is due to be replaced in April 2024 by a competitive daily auction.  This will introduce great uncertainty for market participants.  New plant will not be built unless longer-term hedge contracts are provided to mitigate the price risk.  This is a great concern for the industry and companies within it have jointly submitted their concerns to the regulatory authorities seeking resolution of this issue before the high-level design is signed off.  EirGrid could run competitive auctions for such contracts for the volume it forecasts will be needed over the given period of years.<\/p><p>Even if this is resolved for the system services market, this will only support short duration batteries.  Longer duration batteries for energy balancing to manage the variability in wind and solar generation would still not be financially viable.  The difference in price between charging and discharging is not high enough to provide sufficient revenue.  The capacity market will not provide sufficient revenue to make up the difference required to make projects financially viable.  The missing money could be made up by either increasing the capacity payments depending on the emissions, or possible supports such as RESS for wind and solar if there is a residual shortfall.  As mentioned earlier, energy storage can relieve grid congestion and allow more grid connections at an earlier stage for the wind and solar generation needed to meet our 2030 targets.  However, there is currently no market mechanism for this service.  It is critical that a market is put in place urgently because it takes several years to develop and implement such projects.<\/p><p> There has to be a comprehensive and integrated policy on energy storage.  This policy should have targets, just as there are targets for wind and solar.  It must be integrated with policies on renewable generation, transmission and distribution connections, green hydrogen, the role of gas, sector couplings and so forth.<\/p><p> Ireland will not meet its 2030 or 2050 targets without energy storage to facilitate the required volume of wind and solar generation.  It is needed to solve the problems of grid instability and also variable output from wind and solar.  Furthermore, it can contribute to the provision of more grid connections while the infrastructure is being upgraded by relieving existing grid congestion.  It is important that the roles and benefits of energy storage are understood by policymakers.  Energy storage can contribute to energy security while also reducing curtailment of wind and solar generation.  The markets must be put in place so that all the types of plants required to meet the 2030 targets, and beyond towards 2050, can be financially viable.  There is an urgency to provide clarity on the high-level design for the system services future arrangements, particularly with regard to longer-term hedge contracts.  A solution must also be found as soon as possible on a set of market arrangements so that longer duration storage can be financially viable.  There must be a comprehensive and integrated policy on energy storage, which we acknowledge has commenced.

We represent over 40 members from across the energy storage supply chain and all energy storage technologies that will play a vital role in decarbonising Ireland&rsquo;s energy sector.<br\/><br\/>The current price volatility in the energy market and the Ukraine crisis mean we must fundamentally rethink the structure of our energy system and our key policy goals - security of supply, affordability and sustainability.  Energy storage can contribute to all three of these goals by reducing our CO<sub>2<\/sub>emissions, ensuring a secure and sustainable supply of electricity to Irish homes and businesses while reducing the cost of electricity for consumers.  Energy storage, therefore, must become a vital tool in Ireland&rsquo;s response to the current energy crisis and our longer-term decarbonisation targets.<br\/><br\/>As has been mentioned, the Irish market has seen a very successful deployment of short duration lithium-ion battery storage, with over 350 MW of battery storage currently operational and providing important system stability services via the delivery by EirGrid of a secure, sustainable electricity system, DS3, framework.  This number is expected to grow to approximately 600 MW by 2023.  These batteries provide fast-acting reserves that ensure electricity supply and demand are constantly balanced.  Analysis carried out by Baringa energy consultants on behalf of ESI in 2019 estimates that the provision of system services from battery storage, demand-side response and other low carbon technologies instead of traditional fossil fuel generators can reduce power sector emissions by nearly 2 million tonnes of CO<sub>2<\/sub>per year by 2030.<br\/><br\/>However, the market for short duration batteries is close to saturation and so the focus must shift to energy storage that can store and provide energy for multiple hours at a time.  Energy storage in this space will play an important role in contributing to capacity adequacy by ensuring there is enough available electricity to meet existing and future demand.  Multi-hour storage will also be more active in trading energy, thereby helping to smooth price volatility, and supplying power at times of high demand to displace fossil fuel peaking generation.  There are many technologies that will play a role here.  Lithium-ion batteries are proven at the scale and projects of up to eight hours duration are already in development in markets such as California.Other established technologies such as pumped hydro and compressed air energy storage could also feature, while new emerging long duration battery technologies are likely to become more viable in the coming years.<br\/><br\/>In Ireland, while small volumes of lithium-ion batteries of up to four hours duration have secured contracts to construct in recent capacity auctions, more will be needed.  EirGrid has assumed in its Shaping our Electricity Future roadmap that approximately 1.5 GW of two to six hours storage will be operational in 2030.This should be considered a minimum target and we believe this target could even be doubled by 2030.  However, there is a high degree of risk and revenue uncertainty for multi-hour projects at present which require further consideration and a co-ordinated policy effort to provide the correct investment signals.  One of the key benefits of proven energy storage technologies such as lithium-ion batteries is that they can be deployed quickly relative to new fossil fuel generators.  Our analysis shows that there are over 2.5 GW of storage projects in the development pipeline, with the majority already through the planning system and awaiting a grid connection and a stable revenue stream under which to construct.<br\/><br\/>Finally, in the long term, full decarbonisation of the electricity sector will require the deployment of long duration multi-day and multi-week energy storage, such as green hydrogen, to cover extended periods of low renewable output and provide generation capability at times of need.  Recent analysis conducted by Baringa on behalf of ESI, and shared with the committee members, shows the benefits that energy storage of different volumes and durations can deliver to the Irish system and consumers by 2030.  Energy storage of all durations can help to reduce CO<sub>2<\/sub>emissions with durations of between 24 hours and 100 hours providing the most benefit by reducing electricity system CO<sub>2<\/sub>emissions by approximately 50%.  This would be a significant achievement considering emissions reductions post 2030 will be the most difficult to deliver.<br\/><br\/>In addition, Baringa&rsquo;s analysis shows that strategic deployment of long duration energy storage in transmission constrained regions of the network can reduce renewable constraints by 90% in a case study of County Donegal, one of the most congested areas of the grid.  This would save approximately 250,000 tonnes of CO<sub>2<\/sub>per year just from being able to utilise this renewable generation in the Donegal region alone.  Replicating this in other constrained regions would deliver even greater emissions reductions.  It is therefore essential that the overall policy framework supports investment in a broad portfolio of technologies and enables the deployment of a comprehensive set of energy storage capabilities that can deliver the benefits we have outlined.<br\/><br\/>The Climate Action Plan 2021 sets out a number of actions relevant to energy storage.  These are all welcome, but it will be important to ensure that the timelines for completion of these activities are met and that there is co-ordinated engagement with industry to achieve these targets.  We urge that an industry liaison group be set up with key policymakers such as the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications, the Commission for Regulation of Utilities, CRU, and EirGrid to ensure these actions are completed.  Some of the immediate work streams that are needed are: resolution from the regulatory authorities on the future development of DS3 system services post 2024; fixes to existing EirGrid market systems and operational policies to allow the full integration of energy storage; a connection policy that allows a feasible and timely route to connect to the grid for the large number of storage projects that are through the planning system; and an investigation of the market signals that will drive investment in multi-hour and multi-day storage, as it is unlikely that the existing market will provide the long-term revenue certainty that these projects will require.<br\/><br\/>In conclusion, we ask the committee to consider energy storage as a proven, readily available and fast-to-deploy solution capable of delivering significant CO<sub>2<\/sub>emissions savings.  In order to unlock these savings we ask for the actions I have outlined to be progressed with a sense of urgency by the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications, CRU and EirGrid.  The prize is huge, and it will be worthy of the effort.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022032200002#J00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Bobby Smith"},{"type":"speech","time":1647907200,"counter":47,"content":"<p>Thank you.

The electricity system can be represented by the analogy of a seesaw, finely balancing customers on one side with generation on the other.  The objective is to ensure a perfect balance between the two.  Otherwise, there is a loss of equilibrium, which risks a blackout.<br\/><br\/>With customers being unconstrained in their use of electricity, balance has traditionally been managed by controlling the fuel supply to power plants in real time to match generation to demand.  As we increasingly turn to the wind and sun as our sources of fuel, the availability of which is dictated by nature rather than by pipelines and financial contracts, we must look to supplement our ability to balance the grid by other means.  The <i>raison d'&ecirc;tre<\/i>of any electricity system is to deliver power to electricity customers reliably and cost-effectively.  We must achieve this with minimum impact on our environment and natural resources.<\/p><p> Through the use of enabling technologies, demand response unlocks flexibility in how, when and where customers use electricity to turn consumption into a tool in the operation of the power system.  After all, when balancing the grid, reducing electricity consumption has the same net effect as increasing generation, but uses the latent underlying capability of existing resources, minimising the need for additional infrastructure.<\/p><p> DRAI represents Ireland&rsquo;s leading demand response aggregators, which, between them, enable 700 MW of electricity customers&rsquo; resources to provide services to the electricity system operators, with 200 MW being made available on average over the past 12 months, according to EirGrid's outturn availability data.  Ireland&rsquo;s electricity system requires the top 200 MW of peak demand for approximately eight hours in a typical year. Building an open-cycle gas turbine peaking plant to meet this final 200 MW of annual demand would cost in excess of &euro;120 million and, with no such generator manufacturer in Ireland, the majority of this value will leave the Irish economy.<\/p><p> Furthermore, according to data from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, the construction alone of such a plant would result in the order of 100,000 tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions.  This is significant in the life cycle of carbon emissions of a peaking plant that will only operate for a few hours per year and is often overlooked when considering the carbon intensity of our electricity supply.<\/p><p> Demand response leverages the latent capability of existing assets to minimise the considerable costs, resource depletion, and carbon emissions associated with building new infrastructure, and retains value in Ireland&rsquo;s economy.  Unlike other technology types with characteristics that remain static over their lifetimes, demand response is flexible and responsive.  Through technology enablement and portfolio management our members have evolved the characteristics that participating customers provide as the power system has evolved.<\/p><p> Among our members&rsquo; portfolios are customer groups that are capable of: reducing consumption within 150 milliseconds to compensate for the tripping of other generation plant on the grid; reducing consumption on short-notice instruction to balance the power required by other customers at times of peak demand; increasing consumption to minimise the need to curtail renewable energy at times of abundance; and reducing consumption for long periods, in excess of 24 hours, if needed.  These capabilities are typically sought from peaking power plants or energy storage systems but can be reliably and efficiently delivered by demand response also.<\/p><p> DRAI members&rsquo; portfolios delivered time and time again throughout the past winter and were heavily utilised to mitigate the widely publicised generation constraints that Ireland experienced.  We are being called upon to grow our portfolios and increase our availability in anticipation of further challenges next winter.  However, current limitations on electricity market incentives for demand response remain an obstacle to growth.  I will now hand over to Ms McHugh.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022032200002#J00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Paddy Finn","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1647907200,"counter":50,"content":"<p>The electric power system in Ireland is undergoing an unprecedented transformation as we seek to meet stretching targets for decarbonisation, climate action and electrification.  Grid operators have acknowledged the technical challenges our power system will face in increasing the penetration of renewable energy.  As the system transforms, flexibility across the grid will need to dramatically increase to deliver a safe and reliable service to all consumers.  The Climate Action Plan 2021 sets a target that 20% to 30% of system demand is flexible by 2030.  Demand response is, therefore, key to providing services to grid operators to rapidly adjust output, balance the system, maintain a secure power supply, and quickly respond to events.<\/p> <p>  Commercial and industrial electricity customers continue to be the richest source of demand response in Ireland, but greater incentives are required to stimulate increased participation by this evermore environment, social and governance focused sector, including energy payments and carbon credits to recognise the positive impact their local actions have on our national decarbonisation objectives.<\/p> <p>  The electrification of transport and heat will present new opportunities for demand response in the residential sector in the coming decade.  These are opportunities to not only mitigate their impact on the local distribution system, but also to support the broader operation of Ireland&rsquo;s electricity grid.  It is imperative that the future roles of these energy uses are considered now so we incentivise the integration of the right types of technologies as we approach 2030, so they return the maximum benefit to our energy system.<\/p> <p>  Market rules and policy have traditionally been designed for customers to flip a switch and pay for electricity used, but customers can play an active role in decarbonisation of the power system and supporting renewable generation through providing demand response and flexibility.  National policy, regulation and system operation remain wedded to mimicking the model of traditional power generation, but need to move from the paradigm of how we have always done things to thinking about how electricity customers can become part of the solution.  We need to first look towards what is already there and can be harnessed rather than what needs to be added.<\/p> <p>  To fully exploit demand response as a solution for our power system we need to: remove barriers that exist in current markets and system operation; develop robust markets for energy, capacity, system services and local flexibility that are technology inclusive; incentivise and empower the customer, provide carbon credits, correct levels of remuneration, and prioritise grid access for committed demand response participants to reward service provision; and most importantly, we need to deliver at speed.  Ireland&rsquo;s climate action plan contains excellent initiatives to achieve this ambition, but we need to put the resources and co-ordination in place to deliver.  The ambition of making 30% of demand flexible by 2030 can be achieved, if we put the right policy, incentives and operational capability in place to do so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022032200002#K00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Siobh&aacute;n McHugh"},{"type":"speech","time":1647907200,"counter":51,"content":"<p>I thank Ms McHugh.

We were here last October so I will not repeat the message from then.  I will try to focus on what has changed and what is very much current.  I will also add to the list of the attendees.  Our chief operations officer, Mr. Rodney Doyle, is also with us today.<\/p> <p>  I will start with security of supply because it is one of the big topical issues.  I will first acknowledge the Government's policy statement on the security of electricity supply, published last November.  If we are to deliver the energy transition it is very important that we do not jeopardise the security of the system in the process.  We welcome the Government's position paper.  We are very supportive of it.<\/p> <p>  I wish to clarify our role versus that of the regulator.  EirGrid's job as the transmission system operator is to advise on what we think needs to be done in protecting the integrity of the system guaranteeing security of supply.  The CRU is responsible for making the necessary decisions to ensure security of supply is maintained.  That is very important, because sometimes there can be some confusion around the two roles.  We advise and they decide.<\/p> <p>  The last time we were in front of the committee there was a lot of concern about the winter and the possibility of blackouts.  I am very pleased to say that we navigated it really well.  I compliment my team and all of the other actors involved.  Gas plants came back and we had a lot of wind.  We successfully and thankfully got through the winter.  We are currently in the process of procuring some temporary emergency generation to see us through the next number of winters, under the direction of the CRU.  This is important.  It is our insurance policy to ensure that we are not at risk over the next number of years.  We are busy about getting that commissioned, contracted and installed.<\/p> <p>  I remind the committee of EirGrid's position on gas and dispatchable gas generation.  Gas is essential to see us through this transition.  I cannot overemphasise this.  We are all committed to achieving the Government's climate action target of 80% renewables but gas is our backstop.  This is what ensures that we can deliver this transition and get out the other end, and hopefully with hydrogen replacing gas in due course in the next decade.<\/p> <p>  Based on EirGrid's analysis, we need some 2,000 MW of dispatchable gas generation.  We need it preferably by the end of 2026.  This will do two things.  It will backstop the system and ensure that we have security of supply, and it will help us to see off the old fossil-intensive plants, be they at Moneypoint, Tarbert or elsewhere, in the system.  We should not apologise for it.  It is necessary and it will get us to our goal.  We are very focused on that and we have made very strong representations to the regulator in that regard.<\/p> <p>  Recent auctions for new capacity have not been as successful as we would have liked.  Let us be honest about that.  We have made recommendations to the regulators about how we believe we can improve the probability of better outcomes from those auctions in the months and years ahead.<\/p> <p>  I will conclude on the issue of security of supply by saying that none of us predicted four weeks ago that we would be in the horrible geopolitical crisis we are in and what has happened in Ukraine.  This is making the picture more complex.  It is leading to very significant risk and challenges ahead around the security of our electricity system.  I can assure the committee that working with the Department, the regulator and all other State actors, we are very much on the case in trying to look at what our contingencies are if, for example, there are interruptions to gas supply.<\/p> <p>  We launched the Shaping Our Electricity Future programme at COP26 in Glasgow in November last.  Shaping Our Electricity Future is the seminal piece of work that gives us the pathway to 2030.  It sets out the end game and sets out the pathway for how we are going to get there.  While it is predicated on 70% renewables, because that was our original plan, we are actively working on the Government's recent ask of a target of 80%.  We will publish the incremental pathway for that later in the year.<\/p><p>We welcome the new CRU direction on data centres that came out just before Christmas.  It has given us a framework within which we can work with the digital economy to ensure that there can be further investment in that sector and that we can deliver solutions to allow the centres to connect.  <br\/><br\/>We really welcome the enactment of the Maritime Area Planning Act 2021 in December.  It provides a very firm legislative context for the delivery and development of offshore wind energy in the Irish Sea, which is a key component of delivering the 80% target by 2030.<br\/><br\/>Our own transmission network development programme. which is ultimately what joins up all of the dots, incorporates more than 140 projects and includes new transmission lines, upgrades to existing lines, new substations and new technologies.  I stress to the committee that we are listening to what communities are saying.  Three recent decisions we made about the north Connacht line, the Kildare-Meath line and the convertor station for the Celtic interconnector all involve solutions that we believe are acceptable from a community perspective.  We are walking the talk in that regard.  <br\/><br\/>The 700 MW Celtic interconnector project between Ireland and France is on target and we are hopeful of a positive planning consent in the very near future.  That is critical to security of supply and is also critical to ensuring we can achieve the 80% renewable target.  <br\/><br\/><b><\/b>Moving on to supporting technologies and system services, we are in the final stages of trials on the power system and hope to be able to sign off on 75% renewables on an instantaneous basis very soon.  We have been operating close to that level for the past couple of months and we will sign off and announce same within a matter of weeks.  That is a critical milestone on the journey to 80% renewables.  It is important to note a couple of other critical recommendations we are making in respect of technologies.  A balanced portfolio of different types of technology is essential and we have recommended 1,000 MW of long-duration storage, which is very similar to what our colleagues have said here today.  Storage is critical to making the system work by 2030.  We have put forward proposals around market changes to support the investibility of new technologies.  It is really important that the regulator comes up with proposals that incentivise the deployment of technology on the system to allow it to achieve our goals.  We have made recommendations on new system services products and have made very strong recommendations around the redesign of system services and the capacity markets to ensure we get the right technology at the right time in order to deliver the 2030 objective. <br\/><br\/>The committee asked us for our view on demand response.  At the end of 2021, there was 563 MW of demand-side unit capacity installed on the system, which equates to 364 MW on a de-rated basis.  The availability of these units was, on average, only 160 MW and we are not happy with that.  The market signals, therefore, need to be adjusted to incentivise the performance and ensure we get the service that we need on the system.  By 2026, there will need to be at least 1,000 MW of industrial and commercial demand-side reduction capability in place.  Unlocking that necessary demand-side potential requires the evolution of the electricity market by the single electricity market, SEM, committee, as outlined in EirGrid's Shaping our Electricity Future roadmap.  I remind the committee of the key role the committee plays in ensuring the regulatory environment and the incentives deliver the right solutions for the power system to enable us to deliver on our objectives for 2030.  As Ms Marie Donnelly, chair of the Climate Change Advisory Council said, the greenest MW is the one we do not consume.  In that context, we must maintain a national focus on energy conservation right across the whole ecosystem.<br\/><br\/>We must all remain focused on the objective of decarbonising the power system as a key pillar of the Government&rsquo;s climate action plan.  Nothing has changed around the imperatives of that mission.  The situation in Ukraine further illustrates the need to double down and deliver.  Shaping Our Electricity Future provides a clear pathway for Ireland&rsquo;s decarbonisation ambition in the electricity sector and EirGrid has the capacity and capability and is determined to deliver that plan.  We have identified short-term measures to protect security of supply and these are being expedited following regulatory direction and with Government support.  The delivery of the appropriate dispatchable gas generation plant, battery technologies and the full range of necessary system services is required to be delivered by the regulatory authorities through a market design proposition that creates investor confidence in the near to medium term.  EirGrid will provide what advice and support that it can but the decisions rest with the regulatory authorities.<br\/><br\/>Finally, additional short- or medium-term measures may very well be required in the context of the tragic and criminal events in Ukraine.  We are working with all relevant State agencies to ensure, as best we can, that we put in place contingencies to deal with the possible outcomes of that geopolitical crisis.  <br\/><br\/>I thank the Chairman and members for their attention.  I was rather fast in my delivery of our opening statement but I wanted to leave plenty of time for questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022032200002#K00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Mark Foley","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1647907200,"counter":54,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Foley for his statement and for accelerating its delivery to leave more time for questions.

While the clerk to the committee is putting together the list of speakers, I will kick off the question and answer session.<\/p> <p>  We heard very interesting presentations from the two energy storage representative bodies and from the demand response association.  I would like to tease out how these two sectors can work with each other.  Do they pull against each other?  I would like to think that they are complementary but perhaps the witnesses would address that question.  I ask the DRAI representatives to comment on the capacity in the system, particularly the heavy-energy users such as data centres, which have significant battery storage and backup generation capacity.  Is that capacity being utilised at the moment?  If not, why not?  <\/p> <p>  My next question is for EirGrid.  I am constantly impressed by the company and what it achieves week in, week out, on our system.  I have said it several times that it is the very best in the world and is not learning from anybody else.  It is forging the way forward itself and other countries are learning from EirGrid.  In terms of the challenge for 2030 and the domestic target of 80% of our electricity on an annual basis coming from renewables, questions are increasingly being asked regarding the bigger opportunity and role for Ireland in the pan-European electricity market.  In my view, our interconnection development is very much for balancing purposes, to get us to that 80% instantaneously and on up to 100%, of course, so that we can buy power when we do not have renewable energy here and sell it when we have abundant renewable energy being generated.  Are the right drivers there to develop further interconnection with Europe?  I do not see it as EirGrid's role to do that but, at the same time, I do not see it as anybody else's role either.  Is the State missing a really critical piece?  It seems that further interconnection is required to take the renewable energy generation potential way beyond meeting our domestic needs.  <\/p> <p>  I invite Mr. Phelan to respond first to the question on storage versus demand response.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022032200002#L00200","speaker":"1594"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1647907200,"counter":55,"content":"<p>The Chairman asked whether we are working together and the answer is that we are.

The source we used is published market data from a subsidiary of the Single Electricity Market Operator, SEMO.  It is up to date to the end of February.<\/p> <p>  On the relationship between demand response and energy storage on the system, we all accept that a mosaic of solutions will get us to 2030.  It is about finding the correct blend of solutions in terms of providing best economic value for the electricity customer and minimal impact on natural resources and on carbon emissions.  There is little that demand response can do that storage cannot do but, with some of those characteristics, demand response presents a more economic and lower carbon form of delivery. <\/p> <p>  We spoke about high-speed systems services, which are sub-second responses to a frequency event in the power system that occurs when a power station or wind farm trips off the grid.  The volume of that high-speed service is procured on the assumption that it will be the largest in-feed on the system, that is, the largest generator or connector that will trip at any point.  That is typically 500 MW to 700 MW.  In reality, 90% of power stations on the grid are less than 100 MW, so 90% of frequency events will be of 100 MW or less.  The remaining 400 MW, which apply in only one tenth of events, play to the strength of demand response.  Battery systems and other energy storage systems are good at providing constant frequency regulation and dealing with the little and often.

For every percentage above that, it is about what is the most economic pathway.  It is not about physics.  Dr. Ryan is leading on the project this year to figure out the most economic pathway.  It can be done in many ways but economics is centre stage.  It cannot be done at any price.

We will look at how Ireland Inc. deploys that natural resource, not just for energy but also for economic benefit.  I have no doubt that in that study a question that will arise will be how we will massively increase interconnection.  Ireland cannot use all that energy because we do not have the demand.  How Ireland connects that resource into western Europe will be a key part of that study.  We will break cover on that later in the year.

I have two questions for EirGrid.  Mr. Foley referred to a renewables target of 80% and EirGrid's Shaping our Electricity Future strategy.  It has a figure for onshore wind to be connected by 2030 of 1,300 MW.  On the basis of that figure, presumably the grid reinforcements outlined in the strategy were then identified.  Where did that figure come from?  It is different from the target in the climate action plan of around 4,000 MW of onshore wind by 2030.  Industry figures indicate that between 600 MW and 700 MW of onshore wind are currently under construction and more than 1,000 MW are expected to compete for a RESS contract in the auction in May, with well in excess of a further 1,000 MW in the planning system.  Is it possible that EirGrid has drastically underestimated the likely volumes of onshore wind energy that will connect this decade and, in doing so, is it failing to propose the grid reinforcements that are necessary for those projects to come on stream?  That leads to increased prices for customers and high constraints.  Will EirGrid amend its strategy to incorporate the additional onshore wind and solar between now and 2030?<\/p> <p>  On security of supply and the recommendations that are being acting on in the CRU, what analysis, if any, has been undertaken on zero carbon technology, such as energy storage, that could replace a significant proportion of that 2,000 MW?

On the 70% renewable target, we are looking at our demand increasing by about 50% over the 2030 time horizon.  We are also looking at 5 GW of offshore renewables coming on to system, which is the most effective and efficient way of connecting the renewables to our main demand centres.  Our main demand centre is in the Dublin region.  We are looking to connect that demand directly into those regions.  That leaves the additional megawatts needed to meet the 70% renewable target, which equates to 1.3 GW offshore, as the Senator noted.  From that, we developed the grid that would need to be built around that.  As we move towards the 80% target, we are looking at what the optimal gain is, as Mr. Foley said, around the grid that must be built to move us from the 70% target to 80% and where the most effective and efficient sources are, both between onshore wind and solar and offshore wind, to connect on to the system to meet the new targets.  We will look at projects that are in flight and that do that to make sure we get that on the system as quickly as we possible can in the most effective and efficient way.<\/p> <p>  On the second question, we always look at other technologies.  When we looked at the 70% renewable target we clearly called out that demand-side participation is needed between now and 2030 to meet the targets.  We also looked at other technologies.  We are looking at battery storage coming on to the system and we think 1.4 GW is needed by 2030.  We are talking about balanced portfolios after 2026.  We are saying that 1 GW of battery storage will be required in that time horizon.  If other technologies come on, we will look at them.<\/p> <p>  We are calling out the need for conventional gas generation.  We are making it clear that everything must be renewable gas-ready so that when hydrogen or other renewable gases come forward we will be able to decarbonise those technologies out of the system very quickly.  That will give us the benefit as we move into the next decade.  That gives us a clear security of supply.  The reason we say that conventional generation is needed is that there are periods when the wind does not blow and the sun does not shine.  In such situations we need to ensure we have enough generation on the system to meet the demand we have.  There can be periods of perhaps a week where the output of the renewable sector is below demand.  Having batteries and storage helps but we need to be able to charge those batteries.  Therefore, we need to have some conventional generation to do that.  That is why we have highlighted the conventional generation that we need.  At the same time, the older, higher carbon intensity generators are also closing off the system in the next ten years or so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022032200002#N00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Liam Ryan"},{"type":"speech","time":1647907200,"counter":78,"content":"<p>By renewable gas, does Dr. Ryan mean blue hydrogen gas generators or purely green hydrogen?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022032200002#N00600","speaker":"1635"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1647907200,"counter":79,"content":"<p>We are saying that there can be either.

One of the main reasons renewables are very expensive in Ireland is because they face high levels of dispatch-down, which available wind generation that has to be turned down either due to transmission constraints, congestion in the network, or systems security limitations, which is the 75% instantaneous penetration that EirGrid referred to.  The aim is to get that up to 95% to 100% by 2030.  We fully support that.  It would make a big difference in terms of the dispatch-down that wind and solar face, which would drive down the cost of renewable supports.<\/p> <p>  The other pillar of this, which will be key in the future, is the transmission constraints.  Some projects in the west of the country, in particular, where there is high on-shore wind resource would face constraints of potentially 20% to 30% in the future, if the grid is not built out to accommodate that energy.  The issue is that grid build-out is challenging.  It takes a long time.  These are infrastructure projects in the countryside, so they can take time to deliver.  However, a potential solution, as highlighted in my statement, is that energy storage behind these constraints can provide the same result without the need for that large infrastructure and help drive down constraints by as much as 90%, in some of our analysis.  That would have a huge impact on the cost of renewables in Ireland in driving down that price and utilising the available renewables generation at times when it would otherwise be lost.  That is a key pillar.  A more strategic location and more locational incentives for storage to build in these constrained regions would be ideal.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022032200002#O01200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Bobby Smith"},{"type":"speech","time":1647907200,"counter":95,"content":"<p>Is that point captured in Shaping Our Electricity Future?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022032200002#O01300","speaker":"1594"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1647907200,"counter":96,"content":"<p>Absolutely.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022032200002#O01400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Mark Foley"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1647907200,"counter":97,"content":"<p>We talked about how we need 1.4 GW of battery storage coming in.  We are looking at where they can be placed.  One of the key areas in regard to Shaping Our Electricity Future is that we need to move towards a more plan-led approach in which demand is collocated with renewable generation.  One of the challenges we face is that a significant potential of our renewables is in the west of Ireland, however, most of our demand is on the east coast.  The communities in the midlands sometimes struggle with the infrastructure coming across the midlands.  In essence, we need to look at how we can collocate the generation and demand so that the communities are benefiting from the renewable sources in their areas and having the demand customers connecting in those locations as well.  That will help in regard to the amount of infrastructure we need to build.<\/p> <p>  As part of Shaping Our Electricity Future, we looked at a number of different options at the time.  We engage widely with the communities in how we achieve the optimum solution.  The final publication, as Mr. Foley said earlier, which we publish in November, called for the 70%.  As we move to 80%, we will definitely need to include the technologies.  We will be including demand-side participation, as we did in the last version of Shaping Our Electricity Future, and consider what we need to do around it.

Some semi-commercial light-flow batteries are available.  The advantage of a flow battery is that the energy is stored in the liquid that flows so that if one wants longer duration, one just needs to put in more liquid.  The plates and so on give the megawatts but the liquid gives the megawatt hours.  We will see that sort of technology widely commercially available.  The longer the duration of the battery, the more competitive it is.<\/p> <p>  There are also things such as liquid air energy storage.  One of the advantages of liquid air energy storage is that the generators are synchronous and provide inertia and so on as well.<\/p> <p>  One of things we need to think about is whether we need more pump storage.  The capital cost of pump storage is enormous but it is almost like an insurance policy because we would no longer be concerned about the supply chain for batteries and battery parts.  It will mean a lifetime of 40 years.  Turlough Hill has been around a long time.  It had a half-life refurbishment approximately ten years ago and it will go for another 30 or 40 years.  One of the strategic things the country should consider is whether there are things with very high capital costs that we should be putting in for the long term.  If we decide to do so, we must also consider how to fund those projects because they cannot be funded on a six-year contract.  There is a strategic issue there to be considered.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022032200002#Q00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Frank Burke"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1647907200,"counter":114,"content":"<p>I will come in on the question about technology.  I will try to add to what Mr. Burke has said about the range of technologies.  The key thing to think about in terms of storage is that it has different applications for different technologies.  We spoke about the short duration of fast-acting system services.  They are ideally suited to electrochemical lithium ion batteries.  Lithium ion has proved to be the most economic way of delivering those services for a six- or eight-hour period.  That deployment is happening in other markets such as California, Spain and elsewhere.  The duration of the battery deployment is increasing.  A number of technologies can do that but lithium ion has won the race.  High levels of recycling are being brought into that supply chain.  It is a valuable supply chain.  The level of recycling will reach 90% in this decade.  That will help a lot in terms of materials.<br\/><br\/>When consider multi-hour, multi-day and multi-week batteries, there are other technologies, including compressed air and pumped-storage hydroelectricity, as Mr. Burke alluded to.  The problem with those types of technologies is that they are large and lumpy capital expenditure investments that need to be planned for years, possibly a decade, in advance.  The reality is that the cost curves for things such as lithium ion have been decreasing rapidly over the past decade.  The cost of lithium ion battery packs has decreased by 90% and that is what we are competing with.  Can we make a call today to say we are going to build a capital intensive and difficult to permit solution such as pumped hydro when we can deliver modular solutions in terms of battery technology from lithium ion in the space of years as opposed to a decade?  That is a hard ask for us to proceed with.  We do not have the kind of topography or geography that countries such as Norway have and where that kind of hydro technology can be used for multi-week and seasonal storage.  We do not have that option in Ireland.  Pumped hydro would provide perhaps six hours energy in Ireland.  Lithium ion batteries can almost compete with that and we can expect to see a cost decrease in the next few years.  I do not think pumped hydro is a solution for Ireland.<br\/><br\/>When we consider multi-week storage, other technologies coming through can provide storage for 100-plus hours.  There are metal-air technologies and flow technologies, as Mr. Burke alluded to.  They are coming and will present a much decreased cost because the chemical elements involved are much more common and cheaply available.  To get to multi-week coverage to address the<i>Dunkelflaute<\/i>issue will require green hydrogen.  When we talk about a blend of green hydrogen in the gas network and we say that the current network is capable of taking 20%, it is important to note that is 20% by volume but only 7% by energy because of the difference in energy density.  That is an important point for people to be aware of.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022032200002#Q00700","nonspeaker":"Ms Bernice Doyle"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1647907200,"counter":115,"content":"<p>The Deputy asked two questions of us.

We now have a framework in place.  Are more contracts for services being signed at the moment?  Are they more sustainable?  Would they allow for co-location?  I was at the time keen to insist that if we are to have data centres, they must have a co-location element to them to allow us to have the energy capacity for the service.

The developers have been out there for the past ten years developing their projects.  We are really clear we need those 5 GW of projects.  We need about 1.4 GW of batteries, I think.  We need some onshore wind, some solar and subsistence services.  That is really clear.  The numbers might move a little bit but generally speaking that is what needs to be done.  When we look beyond 2030 - and this is where the Senator mentioned 80 GW - the potential off the west coast is almost unimaginable.

We will do so through a very engaging process with all the actors in the system, including bodies such as IDA Ireland that are looking at the long-term economic interests of Ireland.

I thank the Senator.  It is important again to differentiate, similarly to Mr. Foley, between the 2030 horizon and post-2030.  The 2.5 GW of battery storage in the pipeline at the moment that is pretty much ready to deliver would be more in the multi-hour space providing storage within a day.  For instance, it would be charging at night when there is excess wind, then discharging that energy at the peak demand during hours, for example, between 5 p.m. and 7 p.m. and displacing fossil fuel peaking generation.  That is where that 2.5 GW would play a big role.  Going beyond 2030 and that final 10% to 20% we must decarbonise, that is when we get into the large and medium of storage such as green hydrogen or the other 100-hour plus energy storage technology that is going to play a role.  That would be needed to cover these extended periods of low renewable output, for instance during winter when that energy storage medium is needed to cover those periods.  That is where that comes into play.  That is quite a lot of storage.

There is this concept of revenue stacking.  A six-hour battery, say, can be used to cover amber alert capacity events in the market so capacity can be provided but this daily balancing function can also be done for renewables where companies can charge at times of excess renewables and discharge at time of low renewables.  It can do both those things.  It can also to the system service, that is, the very fast response, so it can do many different things.<\/p> <p>  In Ireland we have been very successful at delivering short-duration half-hour batteries to date.  We are actually kind of done and dusted for the moment because of the technical requirement.  That deployment has happened on the back of clear market signals there were two parallel markets, namely, a tariff market and an auction market, which were signalled way back in 2019 when we in Statkraft invested in the first battery project.  Once developers have clear sight of a market, even for a few years, and they have a reasonable chunk of their capital expenditure that they can see a line of sight of getting a return on, they are an optimistic bunch and will invest.  The pipeline is there.<\/p> <p>  The problem at the moment in getting from that short duration to the multi-hour, daily balancing-type application is we do not have any kind of anchor revenue stream.  We need to do that either by way of a capacity market contract that will cover a portion of our revenue and then we will take some assumptions on what we can get in that daily trading market or the congestion product Mr. Ryan and Mr. Smith have talked about where one builds battery storage behind a constraint and use it to avoid network build-out.  Those are two examples of how a product could be defined and a contract given that would give an amount of certainty to developers to go ahead and move on these projects.

My primary questions are to EirGrid.  I was also going to ask about timelines for the grid as grid capacity is always an area raised with me as a potential risk.  If there is a plan, timelines are put in or else there is far too high a risk of overruns.  I am concerned it will take EirGrid a year to get those timelines into a document where it could be tracked so we would know where we are at any point in time and whether any of the projects have been delayed.<\/p> <p>  On Mr. Foley's other comment on the west coast and exploiting the offshore wind and how it is a future project, it is a really big project to get under way.  From EirGrid's perspective, does it have enough resources to deal with the increased challenges it faces and increased programmes it faces?  A year is quite a significant time to take to produce a table with all timelines for different projects.<\/p> <p>  Bringing it back to consultation and engagement, I note he mentioned the offshore team is working closely with the developers of the phase 1 and phase 2 projects.<\/p><p>My understanding is a grid connection assessment process has started for phase 1 projects and quite a lot of detailed engagement is required as part of that.  Project managers have been requesting clarity on specific aspects of that, such as the operations and maintenance requirements EirGrid would have, the design review process, and the actual functional specifications EirGrid requires, but I understand this clarity is not being provided and there is no engagement or insufficient engagement, consultation or meetings taking place.  When will EirGrid make that clarity available to the industry?  Will it meet with industry representatives in the near future?  I believe this all has to conclude by August.  Investors need clarity when it comes to these large investments.<\/p><p> I may have picked this up wrong, but is there a disconnect between what the storage industry is talking about in terms of requirements and what EirGrid believes are the storage requirements?  It could be the case I picked it up wrong and the types of storage are different.  However, EirGrid is talking about 1,000 MW of medium- to long-term battery storage while I think the industry mentioned 1,900 MW.  That is a significant difference.  What is the reason for that?  Does the industry believe Shaping Ireland&rsquo;s Energy Future reflects EirGrid's needs?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022032200002#R01400","speaker":"1627","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1647907200,"counter":133,"content":"<p>On the Deputy&rsquo;s first comment on the timelines, I can say with absolute conviction that we have detailed programmes, but the issue of publishing them is another matter.

Please do not equate us not publishing it until later in the year with the idea we do not have our foot on the gas; we have.  It is a huge step.

It like not looking up while the comet is hurtling towards the planet.  We are facing the possibility of human life not being able to exist on the planet within a matter of years, yet everything is about how we incentivise the market and how we create business opportunities.  If the knowledge exists and the ability to do all this is available, it should be used for the common good and should not be seen as a business opportunity.  That is why I have a problem with all of this being done by developers and markets.  Although EirGrid has said it does the planning, it facilitates the market rather than seeing it right through to the bitter end.  On that basis, I want to ask EirGrid, when it made that nice quote at the end of its intervention that &ldquo;the greenest MW is the one we do not consume&rdquo;, could that be applied to data centres and could it be said the greenest data centre is the one that is not built, given the context of this crisis?<\/p> <p>  Maybe EirGrid could comment on how much the private developers and offshore energy have put back in.

The ecosystem did deliver, and that was a combination of private companies and State companies.  It was a great example of collaboration, private capital, public capital and ourselves as the orchestrator in making all of this work together.<\/p><p>That ecosystem will get us to 80% by 2030.

We have wanted to achieve the lowest-cost solution for decarbonisation.<\/p> <p>  Regarding Deputy Bruton&rsquo;s question, an answer would take considerably more time than we have.  There is no energy payment for demand response, for example.  As it is utilised, it does not get paid.  The more it is utilised, the more it costs participating customers, which is a counter-incentive to participation.  It clearly does not make good business sense, so it needs to be addressed.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the characteristics of the electricity system and what is being procured, an analogy is the best way to show where we are.  When new services, DS3 system services, are being procured, the mind is always focused on how one is used to doing things.  If we were looking for a mode of transport with two pedals, EirGrid, being used to driving a car, might specify that the pedals need to be an accelerator and a brake and ultimately preclude bicycles.

We are talking about projects with high levels of capital and operating expenditure.  They need long-term revenue support to deliver.  We have had success so far in the DS3 market in respect of short-duration batteries because there was a framework of five to six years in which people had some visibility and a stable revenue they could build on.  Right now, it is a lot more uncertain for multi-area projects.  The only long-term contract that those associated with storage can get right now is through the capacity option.  It is a ten-year contract.  We recently saw in the T-3 option that there was around 1 GW or more of de-rated gas capacity to be cleared compared with approximately150 MW of de-rated battery capacity.  It goes back to why that is the case and how we can change the capacity market to deliver more low-carbon capacity.  That entails emissions limits and treating the storage and demand-side response more fairly in the markets so those concerned can compete and secure the long-term supports, because that is essential.<\/p> <p>  Ms Doyle mentioned congestion products.

I know it is a bit early to say but given the plans that are before us, if it all pans out the way it should, could consumers ultimately see a reduction in the bills?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022032200002#U00200","speaker":"1481"},{"type":"speech","time":1647907200,"counter":165,"content":"<p>At the outset, I found this session incredibly informative, insightful and very interesting, particularly in and around the discussion on storage capacity.  It answers those detractors to renewable energy who ask what we will do when the wind does not blow and the sun does not shine.  There are clearly some pretty advanced solutions out there we can start looking towards.  I also note the area of energy use and conserving energy.<\/p> <p>  This question is specifically for EirGrid.  If other witnesses also want to contribute, they should please feel free to do so.  Since the escalation of the price of fuel and energy, we have heard comments and statements by other Oireachtas Members within the walls of Leinster House such as that in order to ensure energy security, we should look at doing things like reopen the bogs, encourage the return of peat-powered energy stations, build liquefied natural gas, LNG, terminals, and ramp up oil and gas exploration of our own coast.  These are all approaches with which I fundamentally disagree, by the way, and from which we should stay clear.  I believe we should absolutely now focus on ramping up renewable energy, be that floating offshore wind, onshore wind or solar.<\/p> <p>  I would like to know EirGrid's response to those types of comments and suggestions and that policy.  Obviously, gas has a role in terms of energy security and as a transition fuel but in the long-term, by the time we have done all those approaches, we would have significantly increased our renewable energy capacity.

The Shaping Our Electricity Future programme gives a really clear roadmap.  For the first time ever, we have real clarity about what 2030 will look like in respect of technologies, locations and consumers - the whole picture is presented there.  That is our guiding roadmap for the future transition of the power system to one that can handle and will deliver 80% of electricity from renewable sources.  We have got that clarity now.  It is incumbent on all stakeholders to work to deliver that.  There is no confusion about this; it is really clear.  I would encourage everybody to get behind Shaping Our Electricity Future.  It has that clarity.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy mentioned public communities.  Developers of projects like onshore and offshore wind farms etc. and ourselves have done huge work around communities in the last number of years.  The money we are prepared to put back into communities to give them a stake in the transition is really quite phenomenal.  Second, our willingness to listen to their views about our projects is at a level we would not have dreamed of ten years ago.  The communities are very much engaged but there is clearly more that can and should be done.  I refer to both the offering financially and the willingness to listen to the views of communities.  We have walked the walk on this in the last two years in terms of some of the projects, which are very advanced.  They are going into planning with community support because we listened to what the communities said to us.  That will be the roadmap for the future - listen and then give back to communities.  That is my answer to Deputy Cronin.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Doyle will answer on the energy security matter raised by Deputy Devlin, particularly about the market participants.  Let me answer his other two questions.  Regarding gas as a transitional fuel post 2030, the answer is \"Yes\".  We will need gas well into the next decade.  I cannot tell the Deputy whether it will be 2035 or 2038 but gas is vital.  It is really important that Ireland secures its source of gas in order to see us to the Holy Grail, ultimately, of 100% renewables.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy asked a third question about technology and price.  We got from zero to 40% renewables on the power system in 2020 with no increase in the wholesale price of electricity.  That is a fact and a matter of public record.  My view is that we can get the 2030 ambition.  I believe we can do the same again.  Nobody has a crystal ball on this but I think that with technology and competition, wholesale prices of electricity will stay there or thereabouts and we will take away the horrible volatility we are experiencing today with gas prices.  The signs are very good in that regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022032200002#U00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Mark Foley"},{"type":"speech","time":1647907200,"counter":168,"content":"<p>Should we reopen the bogs?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022032200002#U00600","speaker":"1594"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1647907200,"counter":169,"content":"<p>I am trying to figure out my notes about what Deputy O'Sullivan asked.

There is a forum there which provides a route to, if you like, unsiloed activity.  Much more work can be done to streamline that and ensure the age-old issue of technologies competing does not arise.  It goes back to the words often used to describe this, namely, \"mosaic\" and \"stained glass window\".  There are many different scales and sizes to deliver this energy transition by 2030.<\/p> <p>  On Deputy Devlin's question on gas resources post 2030, wearing my energy agency hat, I would point out we have done resource assessments in the south east on potential biogas and biomethane and we seem to be jumping out over that, as it were.  In the assessments we have undertaken from research on demand and potential bioenergy in that space, we have found green gas provides both dispatchable and storage solutions similar to hydrogen.  People would be amazed by the potential energy that sits there if that industry was supported to produce green gas on foot of local employment in rural areas and inject it or move to a virtual network.  There are some interesting projects on that.  This area has been overlooked for a long time.  That is a potential onshore resource to add to the intention of Gas Networks Ireland of having 20% renewable gas in its system by 2030.  We should not forget about the potential for biogas.  Europe recently pointed to it as having a strong potential to decarbonise and also for producing organic fertilisers and, subsequently, supplying some storage as well.<\/p> <p>  On the issue of consumer price reduction, we all agree that auctions and markets have indicated for a long time the cost of energy reducing, particularly electricity, but obviously that is all changed in terms of security.  To follow on from EirGrid's comments on making sure everything arrives at the right time, be it through generation, storage, transmission distribution and distributed demand-side reduction, both in terms of energy efficiency and integrated renewables, in those circumstances, the market should stay stable.  I echo Mr. Foley&rsquo;s comments about being able to do that because everything needs to arrive at the right time.  However, if there were any slips or trips along the road, we will see price increases in auctions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022032200002#V01400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paddy Phelan"},{"type":"speech","time":1647907200,"counter":186,"content":"<p>Does Ms Doyle or Mr. Smith wish to respond?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022032200002#V01500","speaker":"1594"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1647907200,"counter":187,"content":"<p>I will respond briefly to Deputy Cronin's question.  I apologise for all the market-speak in the past few hours but I definitely think there is a lack of joined-up thinking in all of this.  We need a whole-of-system approach.  That is why, in our statement, we urge the creation of a industry liaison group with the different policymakers, ideally led by the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications, and with EirGrid, the CRU and the industry on board, to tackle all these issues and ensure there is a whole-of-system thinking that delivers the broad portfolio of technologies we will need.<\/p> <p>  On Deputy O'Sullivan's point and on EirGrid's point, we need to be ambitious about how we will tackle this.  There is a medium - green hydrogen and other forms of renewable gas - that will be needed for those extended periods of low renewable output, which can often be across Ireland, Great Britain and the Continent.  Interconnection will only help us so much.  What we need, ideally, is for the new generation being built to be hydrogen-fuelled ready at a point in time to convert to that medium of primary fuel and for existing generation to be retrofitted.

I was heartened to hear her mention the words \"whole-of-system thinking\".  That is exactly what we need.  Her colleague, Senator Boylan, mentioned the demand-side strategy.  This is where this comes in.  Demand response is one element of a broader demand-side strategy.  We have energy efficiency, which is the foundation of everything, the demand response, and then price-based and tariff-based mechanisms.  Demand response, in its pure sense, is taking place with industrial and commercial customers.  As we electrify heating, vehicles and transport, our homes will have batteries, solar panels, an EV charger outside and a heat pump.  That becomes important in terms of the controllability of those to provide services in the future or to be incentivised by price.  There is that ecosystem.<\/p> <p>  To note the number of agencies and different parties involved, there is the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, which does excellent work, and our colleagues in ESB Networks, for which this will become an increasing challenge on its network because of the electrification of all these different sources and uses.  It has a programme of work in place and is looking at that.  The solutions are manifold.  They are direct demand response, location based and price based and they need to be thoroughly considered in the round.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy asked what would be the one thing we would recommend to the Minister.  We would say the Minister should take the excellent action included in the climate action plan of having 20% to 30% of demand as flexible and to be very specific about which routes some of that needs to take.  Some of it will be a demand response providing services to the grid, as we discussed, some of it will be locational on the distribution network and some of it will be price based via tariffs and different controllability of devices in homes, SMEs, farms, etc.  We need to make that work for what the system needs.  We need that round view of it.

When witnesses are speaking, I would ask, where possible, that they have their camera switched on.<\/p> <p>  I now move to advice on parliamentary privilege.  For witnesses who are participating from either the committee room or the Leinster House complex, they are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if a witness's statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, the witness will be directed to discontinue his or her remarks.  It is imperative witnesses comply with any such direction.<\/p> <p>  For witnesses who are appearing remotely via MS Teams, they are reminded that there is uncertainty if parliamentary privilege will apply to their evidence from a location outside the parliamentary precincts of Leinster House.  Therefore, if a witness is directed by me to cease giving evidence in relation to a particular matter, it is imperative he or she complies with any such direction.<\/p> <p>  I remind members of the constitutional requirements that members must be physically present within the confines of the Leinster House complex to participate in public meetings.  I will not permit a member to participate where he or she is not adhering to this constitutional requirement.  Therefore, any member who attempts to participate from outside the precincts will be asked to leave the meeting.

It has two core statutory functions, namely, to promote the rights and welfare of children under 18 years of age, and to examine and investigate complaints made by, or on behalf of, children about the administrative actions of public bodies, schools or voluntary hospitals that have, or may have had, an adverse effect on a child.<\/p> <p>  The rights and welfare of children with disabilities have been a strategic priority for our office since 2016.  In our strategic plan for 2019 to 2021, we committed to continue to pursue the progressive realisation of the rights of children with disabilities.<\/p> <p>  Published in October 2020, Unmet Needs raised serious concerns about ongoing violations of the rights of children with disabilities.  This included the significant delays experienced by children in accessing an assessment of their needs, despite the HSE's legal obligations under the Disability Act 2005.  The report proposed actions to address these challenges in a child-centred, rights-based manner.  As members of the joint committee will be aware from my meeting with it following the publication of Unmet Needs in 2020, the actions we recommended included a review of the 2005 Act, with a particular focus on provisions affecting children and having regard to the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs, EPSEN, Act 2004, which we note is currently under review; the formal establishment of an interdepartmental group on children with disabilities, which would prioritise actions that address the early identification, early intervention and early treatment of children with disabilities; a commitment to significant investment is this area whereby the State, via the HSE, must ensure the provision of adequate financial, technical and human resources to support the timely completion of AONs and, more importantly, delivery of services to children; the creation of a centralised HSE database of AON data to identify problems, assess progress in strategy implementation and inform national policy development; and the creation of informational materials on the AON process for both parents and children as well as meaningful engagement with children regarding their AON process.<\/p> <p>  Last December, I received confirmation from the CEO of the HSE, Mr. Paul Reid, that, as of 30 November 2021 and under the HSE's new standard operating procedure, SOP, 6,161 of a historical backlog of 6,558 AONs on 30 June 2020 had been completed and that 2,500 AONs were overdue.<\/p><p>Last December, I received confirmation from the CEO of the HSE, Mr. Paul Reid, that as of 30 November 2021, and under the HSE's new standard operating procedure, SOP,  6,161 of an historical backlog of 6,558 AONs on 30 June 2020 had been completed and 2,500 AONs were overdue at that stage.  As members of the committee will be aware, this SOP replaced the former Part 2 assessment process, which had resulted in less than 10% of assessments being carried out within the statutory timeframe.  Under the new SOP, children have been subject to a uniform screening assessment by two assessors, that is, a preliminary team assessment, PTA, to be completed in a maximum of 90 minutes, regardless of the child's needs.  According to Mr. Reid, data on 30 November 2021 showed that following their initial PTA, 86% of children were referred for intervention and 54% were sent for further assessment.  It is unclear how these percentages overlap or how many of these children are now in receipt of services.<br\/><br\/>Published on 10 March 2022, the findings of Inclusion Ireland&rsquo;s recent parent experience survey about progressing disability services found that out of the 1,013 families who responded, 83% reported a lack of services as one of their top three issues and only 28% of those families were engaging with services at that time.  According to Inclusion Ireland&rsquo;s report:<\/p><blockquote>\tMany parents reported that their child spent a significant time on a waiting list for assessment or therapy intervention.  95% have waited more than 6 months to avail of [the] services, 85% reported that they have waited or continue to wait for more than a year. <\/blockquote><p>While 5% of families got access to the assessment within six months, the same percentage have waited six years to access services.  Communications by the HSE were also described as poor, with 27 families reporting their distress on receiving service statements that highlighted a need for intervention but the scheduled date for such intervention was often two years from the time of assessment.<br\/><br\/>In our report, Unmet Needs, we raised concerns that the PTA would just push back children&rsquo;s diagnostic assessments and would be less thorough, given the time restriction placed on clinicians.  These concerns were not unfounded.  In a High Court judgment delivered on Friday, 11 March, Ms Justice Siobh&aacute;n Phelan concluded that the HSE had impermissibly sought, through the introduction of the SOP, to alter what is required under Part 2 of the 2005 Act.  In the case of applicants CTM and JA, she determined that the assessment officers, while preparing a report in full compliance with the SOP, had &quot;failed to determine that the significant restrictions presenting on initial assessment were caused by an enduring physical, sensory, mental health or intellectual impairment (being ... [those] categories of disability identified in s. 2 of the 2005 Act) but proceeded on the basis that diagnostic assessment of the nature and extent of the disability was not required&quot;.  Significantly, Ms Justice Phelan noted that: &quot;it is only through the proper identification of need that steps can be taken to secure the services to meet that need and so it is not permissible to avoid the proper discharge of the statutory assessment duty because it may lead to heightened awareness of and frustration with deficits in the actual provision of services&quot;.  I concur completely with that view.  It should be noted that the new SOP was due to be reviewed by an independent chair after 12 months, which would have been January 2021.  However, the report arising from this review remains outstanding.  As it stands, the continued implementation of the SOP remains part of the HSE&rsquo;s National Service Plan 2022.  In my view, however, in light of the High Court judgment delivered on 11 March, the review of the SOP is now redundant and continued implementation of the procedure is untenable.<br\/><br\/>I renew my call for the recommended actions set out in our Unmet Needs report to be advanced, in particular as regards the legislative changes required so that the State meets its obligations to children under the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, UNCRC, and the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, UNCRPD, and the investment of resources needed to ensure that children receive an AON and, crucially, corresponding services in a timely fashion.  In light of the above, I call on the HSE to outline clearly to this committee, and to the families of children with disabilities, what it requires from the Government to meet its obligations under Part 2 of the 2005 Act and to ensure that children receive the services they need in a timely manner.  My renewed thanks to the committee for inviting my office to attend today.My colleagues, Dr. McAuley and Ms McKenna-Keane, will be happy to take questions if needs be. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2022032200002#A00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Niall Muldoon","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1647907200,"counter":200,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for the invitation to attend this meeting to discuss consideration of the Ombudsman for Children report, Unmet Needs, and waiting lists for children to access AONs and related matters.  The chairperson has listed my colleagues who are in attendance so I will not repeat those details.<\/p> <p>  The HSE is committed to providing appropriate services and supports for all children in the State.  We recognise that difficulties accessing services create additional stress for families.  Our programme of reform is intended to ensure children have timely access to services based on their needs.  The HSE regrets the negative experience of families, where the current service may fall short of what is needed to meet the needs of children and their families.<\/p> <p>  The ombudsman&rsquo;s report, Unmet Needs, makes a number of recommendations with regard to the needs of children and young people with disabilities.  The HSE particularly welcomes the recommendation that Part 2 of the Disability Act 2005 should be reviewed.  The Disability Act and the EPSEN Act were developed in parallel with one another and it was intended that both Acts would align.  Unfortunately, the relevant sections of the EPSEN Act were never commenced.  This has contributed to the HSE&rsquo;s challenges with compliance.  The Minister of State at the Department of Education, Deputy Josepha Madigan, recently announced a review of the EPSEN Act.  The HSE welcomes and intends making a submission to this review.  We believe that a parallel review of the Disability Act is timely and would provide a valuable opportunity to ensure both Acts are aligned and updated so that people with disabilities can access appropriate health and education supports.<\/p> <p>  Dr. Muldoon also recommended a review of services that continue to rely on diagnosis for access.  In the main, these services are provided by the education sector.  Health and social care services for children with disabilities are delivered based on the child&rsquo;s presenting needs and do not require a diagnosis.  The practice for children&rsquo;s disability network teams, CDNTs, to be requested to provide diagnostic assessments to facilitate access to supports in schools is particularly challenging.  The resources allocated to these teams are often directed towards providing reports for the education sector rather than providing the necessary health supports.  The HSE is fully supportive of the recommendation that access criteria for such services should be reviewed.<\/p> <p>  Since the commencement of Part 2 of the Disability Act in June 2007, the HSE has endeavoured to meet its legislative requirements as set out in the Act.  Under the Act, any person suspected of having a disability born on or after 1 June 2002 is eligible to apply for an AON.  The Disability Act 2005 outlines the statutory timelines under which AONs must be completed.  In effect, the assessment must be completed within six months of the application date with a further month to assess the report and service statement.  In addition, the Disability Act requires us to review each assessment after one year.<\/p> <p>  The HSE receives almost 6,000 applications for assessment of need each year.  We have done substantial work to address the waiting times for these assessments and have made good progress in this regard.  In June 2020, the number of overdue assessments of need stood at 6,558.  The allocation of &euro;7.8 million through Sl&aacute;intecare has facilitated a significant reduction in this figure.  The most recent quarterly report at the end of December 2021 shows 2,395 overdue assessments.  Indicative figures at the end of February show a further reduction to approximately 1,800.  In 2021, the HSE completed 8,353 assessments of need under the Act.  This was the highest number since Part 2 was commenced in 2007.<\/p> <p>  The implementation of the HSE&rsquo;s SOP for assessment of need was intended to ensure that children received timely assessments under the provisions of the Act.  In 2021, almost 5,000 preliminary team assessments were undertaken.  On the basis of these assessments, 86% of the children were put on an intervention pathway.  Some 54% were identified as requiring further assessment but this did not delay their access to health services.  The recent High Court judgment requires us to now revise this approach.  The HSE accepts this judgement and will not appeal it.  We are committed to ensuring that we meet our legislative obligations and we will revise our process, in consultation with families, staff and professional bodies, to ensure that children receive the necessary assessments under the Act.<\/p> <p>  Some 91 CDNTs are now in place throughout the country.  These teams provide child and family centred supports for children with complex disability needs regardless of their diagnosis.  It is important to highlight that an AON is not required to access these services.  Any parent, health professional or teacher can refer directly to the community disability network teams.  We acknowledge that there are waiting lists for these services, however, substantial additional resources have been provided to these teams since 2019.  During this period, more than 475 posts have been allocated to children&rsquo;s disability services.<\/p><p>The posts have been allocated to the various community healthcare organisation, CHOs, based on a number of factors, including the existing ratio of staff to children with disabilities in the area.<\/p><p> We recently undertook a census of the staff on these teams.  The data from this census will allow us to identify further gaps and to develop a comprehensive workforce plan for the area.  However, it is important to acknowledge that the supply of qualified health and social care professions does not meet the current level of resources available for new posts and we are seeking to address this.<\/p><p> We are aware that many families are reporting difficulties accessing services for their children.  We are listening to their feedback and are committed to working with stakeholders to address their concerns.  We are developing immediate actions to prioritise services for children and to ensure services prioritise direct support to children.<\/p><p> That concludes my opening statement.  Together with my colleagues, I will endeavour to answer any questions committee members may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2022032200002#B00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Reid","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1647907200,"counter":202,"content":"<p>Thank you, Mr Reid.

I also want to recognise the invaluable work carried out by the Ombudsman's office in holding the State and the HSE to account for their successive failures to provide services to people with disabilities.  My questions will be directed to the HSE representatives.<\/p><p>Inclusion Ireland's recent survey on progressing disability services found that 85% of over 1,000 families have waited or continue to wait for more than a year and a survey from AsIAm last year had similar results.  Down Syndrome Ireland's recent survey found a disgraceful lack of services.  It found, for example that 64% of respondents in the Cork-Kerry CHO 4 area reported that their children received no therapy of any kind.  A D&aacute;il motion two weeks ago condemned the current situation for young people with disabilities as a gross and unjustifiable inequity in healthcare and education provision.  The evidence is overwhelming that the progressing disability services, PDS, programme is a failure.  It is failing children and their families, it is breaching their rights and it is not providing therapies where they are most needed and most effective.<\/p><p>Mr. Reid claimed that there are now 91 CDNTs in place across the country but that is untrue.  We have only partial teams across the country.  If Ireland had started with ten players last Saturday in the rugby, no one would have said we had a team.  Children with disabilities at least deserve the same standard.  The HSE does not have 91 teams.  When will fully staffed and resourced teams be in place?  What date is the HSE working towards to achieve that?  The HR resources audit of community disability network teams to identify gaps was completed last November but in today's opening statement, four months later, there was no update or change with regard to recruiting the required staff.<\/p><p>What is being done to resolve the massive inequalities based on geography?  The Down Syndrome Ireland survey confirmed the worrying variations in services across Ireland.  In CHO 2, which covers Galway, Mayo and Roscommon, 35% of children did not receive any kind of therapy in the past year but this figure was almost twice as much in CHO 4.  In November 2021, Professor Mac Lachlan explained that the PDS is about replacing the previous system under which accessing services often depended on where people lived and how rich they were but the HSE has not improved that system.  Accessing services is still a geographical lottery and families that can afford it have to turn to private service providers while others simply cannot access services at all.  What is being done to address this?  Is the HSE committed to the establishment of full multidisciplinary teams in all regions. <\/p><p>It was recently reported in the <i>Irish Examiner<\/i>that parents of children with disabilities are being ordered to attend training courses so they can carry out therapies on their own children, who remain on long waiting lists.  They were reportedly told that if they do not avail of these courses, their children will be taken off HSE waiting lists for therapies.  Are training courses for families being used as some sort of replacement for fully qualified therapists?  How many children have been removed from waiting lists by the HSE?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2022032200002#C00300","speaker":"1525"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1647907200,"counter":204,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for her questions.  I will make a few summary comments and then call on some members of my team to give more detail.<\/p> <p>  First, I recognise that waiting lists for children, and specifically the community care waiting lists for children, are excessive.  This is a legacy issue that we are committed to addressing.  In terms of how we will address it, we have secured Government funding for our national service plan this year including significant funding for waiting lists overall and a significant proportion of that will be directed towards community waiting lists and specifically, children's waiting lists.<\/p> <p>  We have a total of around 63,000 children on community care waiting lists that we are anxious to address.  That is an excessive list that we want to address.  It must be recognised that many children and their families across the country receive good care and services through the HSE.  In saying that, I fully acknowledge the stress involved for those children on waiting lists and their families.<\/p> <p>  On recruitment, we are committed to recruiting into our community disability networks.  In 2019, a total of 100 resources were recruited into community disability networks, with a further 100 recruited in 2020 and 85 in 2021.  Our national service plan for 2022 facilitates the recruitment of a further 190 network members.  We are committed to recruiting into those networks across the country.  As I said in my opening statement, recruiting health and social care professionals is a real challenge but it is one that we are committed to meeting and the funding is available to do so.<\/p> <p>  I will now ask my colleagues Ms O'Neill and Mr. O'Regan to provide some specific detail in response to Deputy Cairns' questions on particular CHO areas and the availability of therapies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2022032200002#C00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Reid"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1647907200,"counter":205,"content":"<p>I will try to answer some of the Deputy's questions.  Ms O'Neill or Professor MacLachlan might pick up on any I cannot address.<\/p> <p>  We are very conscious of the geographical differences both in terms of the service experience for children and families and also in terms of the staffing levels that are available in the CDNTs in the different CHOs.  In deploying the additional resources that are allocated to us this year, we have done so on the basis of an analysis of the staffing levels within the teams, the ratio of children being supported and also taking cognisance of other factors in particular CHOs.  For example, any indices that may help us in terms of determining need, levels of disability and so on are being factored in.  We will become more sophisticated in doing that over the next few years but it was all part of the process this year.  We have weighted the allocation of posts to those CHOs and those disability network teams that are further behind in terms of the ratios of supports of staff to children, to try to raise the levels of staffing and consistency in order to address some of the geographical gaps.<\/p> <p>  In terms of training courses, there have been some experiences of this.  I want to be clear, on behalf of the HSE, that it is not the case that training courses should be used as an alternative to appropriate therapies and interventions.  There are circumstances where providing training to parents and families can be complementary to the provision of direct services, but not as an alternative to them.  Where that is happening or where families are being told that they are at risk of being taken off waiting lists, that is not the HSE policy.  Where it does happen, we will raise it with the CHOs or with the service concerned to make sure it does not happen.  To my knowledge, no child has been removed from a waiting list because a parent did not attend a training course.  I will, however, come back to the committee and confirm that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2022032200002#C00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Bernard O'Regan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1647907200,"counter":206,"content":"<p>Training for parents is not a replacement for intervention.<\/p><p>Undoubtedly, there are children who will require face to face interventions from the members of our team but providing parent training is not offered as a way of making up for less availability of therapists.

We need to support the people in their environments and communities to facilitate them to communicate or to make the appropriate gains and changes in order that they can maximise their learning and function as best they can in society.  It is a valid way of working with families to help them have the skills to help their children in those day-to-day environments.

It is important we listen to the concerns expressed.  All of us meet families with such concerns regularly.  Public bodies have a duty to assess unmet needs.  It should not be up to the children or their families to tell the services what they need.  With the Covid-19 pandemic, the past two years have been horrific for children with disabilities and their families.  It is a crisis.  We must acknowledge that and, if we do not, we are in trouble.  To take the example of children with disabilities being cared for in the family home, more than 400 carers of children with disabilities are over the age of 80.  Those are the statistics.  I wonder what can we do to ensure this cannot continue to happen.  I am in the community healthcare organisation, CHO, 5 area.  I had better not say what I want to say because I probably should not and I must be mindful, but the communication is so poor it is unreal.  When families and mothers come to me, they are at breaking point.  I have contacted HSE CHO 5 and I might as well be talking to the wall because I have not got a response by way of email, a telephone call or an answer.  I want to know who is accountable when I submit queries on behalf of families who are at a crisis point and to whom I cannot come back with information?  Who do I need to contact when families contact me?<\/p> <p>  I was contacted by a lady yesterday who is from Carlow and her child, who was diagnosed with autism in 2019, still has not been assessed because she does not have a statement of needs and does not have access to any therapies.  That mother was upset, her file was mislaid and when she attempted to lodge two formal complaints, there was nowhere to which to submit them.  She said she could not complain about the system because there was nowhere to which she could lodge a complaint.  If people like this mother are contacting me pointing out they are not able to complain about the system which their children are very much affected by, how will we resolve the problems?  The mother in that case paid privately for an initial assessment to get her child into a cr&egrave;che but had she not done that, her child would have lost out.  She did not have the money to do it but she told me she had no choice other than to pay privately to get her child looked after.  She told me that for almost a year while the CDNT was meant to be implemented, she still has not heard from it and now another year has passed.  <\/p> <p>  I do not mean to be hard but for the past two years, families with children with disabilities have been contacting me.  I do not know how we will begin to address the demand for respite services.  Families are distraught about not being able to access respite services.  I cannot get answers for them and I am sick trying to do so.  A mother telephoned me about it again the other day.  She told me she loved her child but was at breaking point.  There has been no communication.  If I could get one point across today, it would be the need to address the communication issue.  <\/p> <p>  Another issue is access to transport.  The issues involved cut across sectors.  The issues with respect to education, transport, respite and assessment hit across Departments.  One Department will blame another and it, in turn, will blame another one, and we cannot get an answer.  I have raised this issue with the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte.  I can say this because I work closely with her.  I have complained about the system and pointed out that no officials in the Departments will come back to me with answers.  If we cannot get responses, how will we fix a broken system where families are crying out for help?  I am tormented over it.  My nephew has Down's syndrome.  I am his godmother and he is the apple of our eye .  I often ask his mother what is the biggest need and she would mention Down Syndrome Ireland and being in the system.  My nephew, Jamie is in the system.  He is the Delta Centre in Carlow.  We are blessed.  We have great facilities and I can only compliment the staff there.  My sister told me she has found it a nightmare to get insoles for Jamie.  A child with Down's syndrome needs insoles for their feet but she has told that if she tries to get special insoles for Jamie, the hassle and the rigmarole she has to deal with is unreal.<\/p> <p>  I am on the board of the Holy Angels day care centre, which does excellent work.  I compliment the hard work of the staff, particularly during the past two years.  They are getting a new build.  I have tried to get information from the HSE on it, and I have been working with the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, on that.  The only information I can get is from the Minister of State; I cannot get information from anybody else.  I ask today for a contact for CHO 5, who would contact me about the different issues I am trying to find out about.  People have contacted me regarding that centre and as I am on the board, I understand the difficulties they have.  They are waiting for referrals and are not getting them because assessments have not been done.  Technically, we have a system where many children are waiting to be referred and they are not being assessed.  They cannot get into the system.  It is a nightmare.<\/p> <p>  I also wish to get an update on the section 38 and section 39 agencies.  I would like to get back in later.  I hope the witnesses do not think I am being hard on them.  However, I am working with families and children in the system and trying to help them but I cannot and it is very hard for the children and their families.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2022032200002#D00300","speaker":"1511"},{"type":"speech","time":1647907200,"counter":210,"content":"<p>Who wishes to respond to the Deputy?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2022032200002#D00400","speaker":"1682"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1647907200,"counter":211,"content":"<p>I will come back to the Deputy tomorrow with a contact for CHO 5.

I appreciate the Deputy's comments about the services in the Delta Centre and other providers and the positive developments happening in those.<\/p> <p>  The communication issue is one on which we would concur with the Deputy.  We know we are not getting that right, not only at a national level in terms of communicating what it is that we are trying to do and keeping people informed, but also how families at an individual level are experiencing it.  It clearly is not working in the way that it should be.  We have established a small group made up of a number of key people, including families.  We are working to develop and improve communication generally and we will seek to put in place some measures in the coming months that will significantly improve it.  That will not achieve it all but it is important to acknowledge we see the importance of it and are working on it.  <\/p> <p>  The Deputy correctly stated many of the issues facing disabled people are cross-Government matters.  There are issues for which the HSE is responsible and for which the Department of Health is responsible.  As the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth takes on responsibility for disability services, post transfer its role will further enhance and increase.  Issues such as transport and housing are roles for other Departments.  As the disability action plan, which is currently worked on, progresses, it will increasingly seek to take a whole-of-government approach and not only segment the areas of responsibility into individual Departments, albeit they will have their role and responsibility also.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2022032200002#D00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Bernard O'Regan"},{"type":"speech","time":1647907200,"counter":212,"content":"<p>I am conscious Dr. Muldoon has not had an opportunity to come in.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2022032200002#D00600","speaker":"1682"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1647907200,"counter":213,"content":"<p>On the communication issue, it was great to hear Mr. O'Regan agrees the communication is not right across the country.

To hear that a Deputy is being told consistently that a CHO does not accept a complaint is detrimental to the child's rights because the parent cannot come to my office as an arbitrator of last resort if the complaint has not been through the local procedures.  If local procedures are not working, issues cannot go forward to an independent arbitrator.  That is a really crucial setback on children and it puts too much pressure on the parent to find the fix or that.  If a parent has to argue a case with a Deputy who then has to raise it with us at an Oireachtas committee to get a contact then the system needs to be stepped up.  It is good to hear that the Deputy is agreeable to that.  <\/p><p> I am delighted to hear that the cross-Government piece around need, as outlined in our report, has been accepted.

My first question is in regard to the 91 children disability network teams that have been established and the services and supports that they provide in the geographical areas.  In regard to the 190 posts recently announced in the service plan for 2022, it is obvious that the demand for therapeutic supports is outstripping supply and that more therapists are required to meet that demand.

I will make a couple of points at a general level.  In terms of recruitment, the focus on specialist recruitment and on retention, at HSE national level we have created a new recruitment model aimed at streamlining the recruitment process and to give further delegation at local, community, CHO and hospital levels in terms of approvals for recruitment.  Separate to that, we have a model that has the support of an external agency in terms of specialised recruitment, sometimes beyond the health service and, sometimes, Ireland.  We have engaged a specialist partner as a very new recruitment model.  The big challenge for the HSE, which the Deputy touched on, is the issue of retention not just specifically related to community and, in particular, children specialties, but across the board.  The HSE has to recruit 9,500 staff every year just to stand still.  From January 2020 to January 2022, net recruitment was 12,500 staff.  A large number of those went to the community and health care teams.<\/p> <p>  We have a very significant challenge every year just to stand still.  Equally, our retention process largely is about making the health service a good place to work, trying to provide extra supports for our staff in those areas and trying to get the shift particularly into community care and multidisciplinary teams.  It is never related to just one specialty.  Some of my colleagues might want to add to that.  It is also about having that multidisciplinary team approach to give the individual specialists wider supports.  As I said, there are a number of initiatives.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2022032200002#E00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Reid"},{"type":"speech","time":1647907200,"counter":217,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Reid.

We are looking at that.  As part of the recruitment design that we are bringing the organisation to, it is about more local control over recruitment as well.  We have heard the call for local areas to have more say in terms of resources.  We are taking that seriously in terms of trying to make sure that areas have a bit more autonomy in terms of how they recruit.

We have a way of advertising panels.  For example, we advertise for senior occupational therapists or basic grade occupational therapists for which people apply to a national panel.  They are then interviewed and, if successful, placed on a panel.  A person might be placed second on a panel and be offered a particular job but within a local service, there might be people who are further down the panel and who do not get prioritised by virtue of their position on the panel.  Many services feel they do not get to control who comes in to their areas, albeit we have to have a level of transparency because of our recruitment licence in terms of how we operate panels.  That said, we are very much looking at how we can have a local and a national approach to recruitment that would help to rectify some of the challenges the Deputy raises.<\/p> <p>  In terms of posts in general, there is some challenge around having sufficient posts allocated.  We are here today talking about children's disability services but on another day we could be talking about child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, mental health, primary care services or children's services in hospitals.  All of those services will draw on the same cohort of qualified professionals.  This year, we are approaching all graduates and we are looking at a national campaign and an overseas campaign because we have a lot of posts.  As mentioned by Mr. Reid, there has been unprecedented recruitment in the past couple of years.  We hope to continue that this year.  The reality, as we have said before, is we are in a global market and many of our graduates want either to leave to work abroad after college or to work a year or two and then go abroad before they come seniors etc.  We are operating in that space, but we are trying to get people in from as many places as possible.

For instance, some of our children's disability network teams, CDNTs, have vacancy rates of up to 50%.

I am aware that representations have been made to the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, about looking at how we can create a step change in the number of people coming through the pipeline.

I will look back at the answers.  My issues are very similar to those discussed by other members in the area of recruitment.  Senator Seery Kearney and I had a great meeting last week with a team in Dublin for the PDS and children's disability network teams, CDNTs.  What it is doing is fantastic, but it is about getting the resources and the staff.  I was interested in listening about that recruitment programme.  Once one gets into the system there is care, and we see that across all the HSE services.  Once one is in the system, one is taken care of.  We need to get to that point.  There is a bottleneck and the waiting lists are endlessly disappointing, frustrating and heartbreaking.  While they are numbers or names on a page, they are children and families.<\/p> <p>  I do not have questions because many of them have been answered, particularly regarding recruitment.  We need drastic change and a drastic shift in mindset in the country as to how we deal with, help and include people with disabilities.  It is not just in the HSE but about moving everybody's mindset and moving from the medical model.  Of course, the HSE is in tune with a medical model because that is what it does and that is its mindset.  However, we have to change that to a social model for taking care of the person.  The person is not ill, but needs the therapies and the step up in society and that equity.  The therapists who are missing and who we are waiting for are that step up or equity for them, and all our citizens, to be the best they can be.  I reiterate the frustration of parents and the heartbreak of children who are waiting on the waiting lists.  The sooner we get those places filled, the better.  I know the staff are at their wits' end trying to fill them, and I hope we fill them.  It is cruel to both the morale of staff working in the HSE and, more importantly, to the children who have unmet needs.<\/p> <p>  The committee should do anything it can to push the recruitment and to have a long-term plan with other Departments, such as the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, to make sure we have that body of therapists coming on stream, to make sure that we are educating our workforce and to make sure that we have staff and people who can open the door through upskilling and continuous skills development to move into these therapies.  It is a really worthwhile business to be in and for getting children to be their best selves.  If I was talented and skilled enough and had that ability, it would be a wonderful place to be.  Unfortunately, I do not think I would ever be fit to be able to do that.  However, I hope the committee can help the witnesses to make sure we reduce those waiting lists and get those needs met.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2022032200002#F00200","speaker":"1671"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1647907200,"counter":226,"content":"<p>I will make a couple of comments in response and then call on my colleagues.

I reassure the Senator, because she made the point very well, that certainly none of us and our teams on the ground view anything to do with the waiting lists as numbers or tables or anything like that.  There is an absolute passion in the health system, which I have experienced, regarding the frustration of waiting lists.<\/p> <p>  There are a couple of general points about addressing this, as I mentioned earlier.  There is a big legacy issue with waiting lists, and specifically with children.  There are two aspects to it.  One is the resourcing and recruitment.  Over the past two years we have seen record levels of recruitment into the health service.  If one looks at the balance of the recruitment levels, we have often been criticised that it is just more managerial positions coming in, but any analysis will clearly demonstrate health and social care priorities, such as nurses, midwives, doctors and consultants.  That has been consistent for the last two years, and our plan for this year has significant extra recruitment.  I wish to make a point that I meant to make to Deputy Dillon as well.  In recruiting the 12,500 net increase last year we actually had to recruit 35,000 staff between the 9,500 churn each year as well as people for testing, tracing and vaccinations.<\/p> <p>  I can give an assurance as well in terms of trying to recruit those specialties, particularly community specialists and for disabilities, be it speech and language therapists, occupational therapists or psychologists.

It is about supporting that whole-of-government approach and that long-term examining.

I believe it was in 2018.  The committee highlighted that there were 17 different points in the recruitment of an individual and that it could take up to 18 months.  Flaws in the panel system were identified.  The HSE has had enough time to move the supply line and start changing it.  Given the talk about it now, to the effect that it will take a number of years to change it, there is a question as to what has happened since the clear recommendations of the Oireachtas committee were made.  I do not believe there is anybody left who believes the panel system is the right way to go for anybody in recruitment.  We just need to look at that again.  It is the children who are suffering at this point.  We have a panel system that does not do the best for the professional involved or the individual who needs the services.

When we consider the scale of the recruitment of health and social care professionals in all care groups &mdash; I appreciate this committee is about children with disabilities &mdash; we note we have never before recruited so many health and social care professionals across all disciplines.  There are several disciplines in which there is very short supply in Ireland.  A very small number of dieticians are trained in Ireland, for example.  We are dependent on overseas recruitment.  That is not a process issue; it is a supply issue.  We are certainly working on it.  We have similar challenges with the recruitment of consultants etc., in respect of which we have worked through a lot of improvements.

I acknowledge, as we address the important issue of waiting lists for children in accessing assessments of need, that yesterday was World Down Syndrome Day.  This has been a very constructive engagement and it was very useful to hear what we have heard.  Others have expressed very clearly the frustration of families and parents.  In our constituencies, we all hear about the delays, long waiting lists and difficulties in accessing assessments of need and interventions for children.  In my constituency, Dublin Day South, there are really serious issues over delays in conducting assessments for children with autism and a lack of places.  It is immensely frustrating for parents and families in those circumstances.  Others have spoken about inconsistency between different geographical areas.  That is clearly a major issue too.<\/p> <p>  I want to focus on two points.  One is the issue of the cause of the delays, particularly difficulties in accessing assessments.  We have talked about the panel system and the recruitment and retention issues.  It sounds as though, as Professor MacLachlan said, the biggest cause of the delays is the lack of supply, or the pipeline issue whereby we are simply not ensuring there are enough qualified staff.  I was particularly struck by Ms O&rsquo;Connor&rsquo;s comment about the lack of dieticians and our dependency on overseas recruitment in this regard.  The ombudsman has asked us to think about what is required from the Government if the HSE is to be able to meet its obligations under Part 5 of the Disability 2005 Act to ensure children receive the services they need in a timely manner.  That is a crucial question.  What is needed from the Government?  It sounds as if one key ask, which is not a short-term ask, as has been said, is more resourcing at third level to ensure training places are provided to bring enough people through the pipeline, although it would take some years to deliver.  That is one key means of addressing the shortfall in the supply of qualified staff.  Is that an ask we should be pushing the Government on?<\/p> <p>  My second point, which relates to what the ombudsman has pointed out, concerns the recent High Court judgment, the SOP process and the fact that the court has found that the procedure is not in line with what is required under the Act.  I am struck again by comments about a necessary review of the 2005 Act and the contention that the provisions of that Act are now somewhat outdated, but people are anxious that a review would not dilute the quality of services for children or the obligations on the State to provide services.  My key question concerns how the HSE proposes to revise the process.  I note Mr. Reid says he accepts the judgment and will not be appealing it.  Therefore, given that the revision is under way, what sorts of adjustments are likely to be made to the process?  When are we likely to see a new process in place?  The ombudsman may wish to comment because he has said his view is that, in light of the High Court judgments, the review of the standard operating procedure is redundant and continued implementation is untenable.  Clearly, however, nobody wants to see children falling between the cracks while the process is being reviewed.  It is a matter of considering the transitional phase while the process is being reviewed.  When we are likely to see a reviewed process, and what changes are likely to be made?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2022032200002#G00500","speaker":"1698"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1647907200,"counter":234,"content":"<p>We have been considering the High Court judgment over the past week or ten days since it was issued.

It will be critical to consider that as well.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the process, we have issued some guidance to the system indicating every child is entitled to apply for an assessment of need where that assessment of need is agreed with the parents to be conducted in the format that would have pertained previously.

A suggestion in Ms Justice Phelan's ruling is that more time should be spent on doing assessments.  One of the implications of spending more time on assessments with a fixed resource is that there will be less time available to provide interventions.  No one wants that on balance.  We will need to deliver a new standard operating procedure that recognises a necessary trade-off - we want an assessment that is of sufficient quality to identify the interventions that people need but not an assessment that is so prolonged that it precludes the opportunity to provide those interventions.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Bacik asked about short-term measures.  We will convene various stakeholders, including the professional bodies, all of which appropriately want to promote a good quality of assessment.  Our role within the HSE and the clinical programme is to consider this matter systemically so that we are not only looking at the child in front of us and ensuring that he or she is getting a good level of assessment, but also at all of the children on the waiting list in the hope that they get timely assessments followed by appropriate interventions.<\/p> <p>  It is important to recognise, as Ms Justice Phelan did in her ruling, that delays in interventions cause subsequent problems for children with disabilities.  For example, they can result in children developing secondary disabilities.  We will have to have another go at squaring the circle - with fixed resources - of having a focused assessment that does a suitable job of assessing, while leaving enough resources to provide the necessary interventions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2022032200002#H00200","nonspeaker":"Professor Malcolm MacLachlan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1647907200,"counter":237,"content":"<p>The important point to keep in mind is that the Disability Act gives an entitlement to an assessment rather than an intervention.

Rather, it is a question of attracting graduates, filling posts and having suitably qualified and experienced staff available to provide supports for children and families.

It is crucial that this happen, but the arguments that were made for the SOP that was implemented and has now been found to be less than accurate in terms of the legalities were that we would increase the number of services that were available to our children and reduce assessments from eight weeks to 90 minutes, thereby leaving more time for services to be provided.

The database is 20 years old and has not had the necessary upgrades or technical changes in recent years that are generally required for IT systems to reflect changes in policy, operational practice and user requirements.  This has created many challenges for both disability services nationally and for system users locally. <\/blockquote><p>We are talking here about a database that records the data on assessments for children to allow the HSE to plan and inform the Minister.

In her earlier contribution she said there are difficulties with the HSE meeting its legal obligations under Part 2 of the Act so its hands are tied.  She was suggesting that the HSE hands could be untied by changing the law which suggests to me that it wants the requirements to provide proper assessments of children to be diluted which would allow the HSE to get around the High Court judgment that clearly found it had not been providing the necessary assessments.  The HSE seems to want to get around it by going to the Government and asking it to change the law.  It is not a case of either-or.  I need to impress this on the people taking part in today's meeting.  If they are dealing with the parents we are dealing with, they should know the frustration they feel.  They will not tolerate a dilution of the law.  If it happens, it will be met with fierce resistance.  There should be no more cutting corners, no more breaches of the law.  We need to properly resource the services and deliver on the Act that is in place.  The HSE should not consider appealing the judgment, which Mr. Reid has said it will not do, or changing the law.

Deputy Cullinane referred to the shame on society due to how we treat vulnerable children in this State.  I spoke to Ava's mother, Elaine, earlier today to get permission to tell the story.  Ava is a unique child but, unfortunately, her story is not unique.  I could have gone to many people whose cases crossed my desk in recent years who were looking for support through the HSE for their children with disability.  Ava is now eight years of age.  She was referred for an assessment of need when she was three.  She received the assessment when she was six, which was three years of a wait.  She was in the system two years ago, but contrary to what was said earlier, that once you are in the system you get the care that you need, that is not the experience of Ava and many people and families that have contacted me over the years.  After she got her assessment of need, Ava received a diagnosis of autism, sensory processing disorder, global language delay and receptive and expressive language disorder.  The assessment of need stated clearly that the interventions she needed were psychology, speech and language, occupational therapy and physiotherapy.  To date - this is where the shame comes in - Ava has received none of these interventions.  I received a response from the HSE six days ago that stated that it is still not possible to tell me how long Ava will have to wait for each specific intervention.  It is five years since she was referred to the HSE and two years after she received a diagnosis and a referral for intervention, but this young girl has still received nothing.  Her mother reports that she is now regressing, to the point where she can no longer tie her shoelaces, which she was previously able to do.  She has also started to self-harm and to express harm towards other people, specifically in her family.<\/p> <p>  I went through the reports and the responses from the HSE I got since I started trying to help Ava and her family over the years.  The witnesses can throw SOPs, AONs, CDNTS, IFSPs, EITs and SATs at me all they want, but as the Ombudsman for Children said previously at this meeting, this is just a way of moving children from list to list without getting the necessary treatment.

I know the team here today.  It is not appropriate to target management as carrying the shame on this one because, to be quite frank, we want to solve this issue.  We have a legacy issue here for many years.  The service is broken.  It is not right.  I have committed, but I cannot give Deputy Ward an assurance here today.  The assurance I can give is that we are committed to resourcing this effectively and to shifting the care into the community disability networks.  We are committed to transforming the care in communities in a much better way, specifically for children with disabilities.  We are committed to getting the resources from the Government for it.  We have got significant resources in the past two years.  It is a challenge all across the waiting lists.  We secured further extra funding this year.  Some of the approaches we will be taking in some specialties include the use of some capacity in private care to help us address some of these very significant waiting lists.  I assure the committee that we have the same passion as they do.  We get the same representations as they do.  I acknowledge that many children and their families across the country are getting good care but, equally, I acknowledge that many are not getting the care that we want to provide.

If Deputies or Senators have other comments afterwards, we can take them.<\/p> <p>  In a way, Deputy Ward has stolen my thunder in that I have an example or similar case with a child whose date of birth is 2013.  That child has been assessed and the services planned for the child have been indicated but the child has received none of those services.  That is not unique in my constituency of Dublin South-Central, taking in CHO 7.  There are widespread complaints of a complete and utter lack of services and the bases from where the services are supplied have a very high rate of staff turnover.  There is a very high level of vacancies.  I would appreciate some comments specifically on the CHO 7 area.<\/p> <p>  I was on the site visit to the Sheriff Street primary care centre last week.  Ms O'Neill was there and it was a very productive visit involving both me and Senator McGreehan.  It can be easy to demonise the HSE but not when one sits with the individuals.  I see that passion here today and a commitment to children with disabilities.  On the other hand, I must also sit with the parents who are devastated seeing their children fail to pass developmental milestones.  These may be small differences from a neurotypical child but the milestones may appear to be missed because we are either operating with a medical model and not moving to a social model or we are not considering both aspects.<\/p> <p>  One of the elements that arose last week was the idea of communication.  We were walked through how that should and how it is in Dublin North-Central versus the delivery and they are very different experiences.  Perhaps the facilities are better staffed because a child can be referred by a parent and there are support services for toilet training and other particular objectives set out for parents.  That was the first time I saw training courses in context and how they are intended.  Maybe that vision and experience has not be communicated.  I welcome any comments on that also because it is certainly the impression of parents that they are being obligated to be clinicians, which is a real challenge.<\/p> <p>  I have a problem with the recruitment panel and I acknowledge all that has been said today about the review of the panel system.  I am an employment lawyer and I advocate for people to have flexible and remote working possibilities, as well as all sorts of part-time working and whatever is required from the perspective of equal access to the workplace.  However, I have an issue with people being recruited to full-time jobs and not being in the role a terribly long time being permitted to go part-time.  They can have part-time hours in the private sector and we would lose those from the public sector, thereby ending up with a two-tier system where if people can afford to access services for a child, that child will get them, but if they cannot, the child will lose out.  They will get the letters that are obligatory under the 2005 Act telling them they will access their services in 2024 in some cases.<\/p> <p>  I acknowledge that Mr. Reid has been responsive to queries I have raised with him and I very much appreciate that.  I know it infuriates and I use the term that it feels lacking in any humanity when parents get these cold letters about services that they are to access two or three years from now.  I have also listened today to the witnesses talking about graduates leaving the country.  What can we do practically to stop them leaving the country so that at least those in the system or pipeline to be recruited will not be lost?  What can we do practically and quickly in that respect?<\/p> <p>  When I hear about supply chain issues that will cause a delay of years, I find it very chilling.  I have a child who is six and if I thought it would take years for her to access services, I know I would be very radical in chaining myself to the gates outside.  We want to avoid that and we want to have a cohesive plan that will not find us this time next year having a meeting similar to this and lamenting small progress.  What low-hanging fruit could we go after now?  Should we be going into colleges or abroad?  I remember in the noughties we recruited construction workers abroad and did fairs in Florida and all over the world in order to bring in people.  Could impediments be removed quickly so we could have quicker delivery of services?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2022032200002#L00200","speaker":"1682"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1647907200,"counter":274,"content":"<p>I will address some of the points.  Communication is a high priority for us and I understand the effect even of the way letters are worded, the type of language used and the timeframes in them.  That meets a legal requirement on one side but there is also the question of the experience for families.  It can be very upsetting, particularly for the families at an early point in engaging with the health and social care service.  It is not the starting point they should have in engaging with services.  We want to be able to look at that and we have prioritised it as part of how we are looking at communications overall.<\/p> <p>  The Acting Chairman made a point about how we are conveying and explaining what the service ambition is and what we are working towards.  We are working on that.  We will not be in a position to facilitate the types of visit that she and her colleague had last week.  Although we can facilitate it for some people, we need to be able to ensure families have a good sense of what the service will be and what the vision is.  We are working on that.<\/p> <p>  There are a couple of points relating to recruitment.  Ms O'Connor and Mr. Reid spoke about some of the steps being worked on in looking at recruitment.  One element is consideration of how we are describing the service that people would come into so that working in children's disability services and being part of the children's disability network team could be seen as an employment prospect that is appealing, exciting and something of which people want to be a part.  When they have choices about where to work - whether it is primary care, the child and adolescent mental health services, older person services or children's disability services - we should be able to describe the service as something that jumps out at prospective employees as being a good place to work and a good service with which to be involved.  It should be seen as a place they can bring their skills to fruition and make a real contribution to the lives of children and families.  This is in addition to the recruitment strategies we are running, looking at opportunities around assistant grade staff and others who may also be able to play a role.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2022032200002#L00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Bernard O'Regan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1647907200,"counter":275,"content":"<p>I will pick up on Mr. O'Regan's last point and the idea of low-hanging fruit.

In many traditional training courses, people are trained in a disciplinary way of thinking and it is only when they graduate and start practising that they navigate working in an interdisciplinary way.  There are opportunities for us to develop new courses where people are trained in an interdisciplinary way from the beginning.  Then when they graduate, they can hit the ground running.

They went to Your service your say and the system did not work for them or provide them with any information.  We would get involved but our problem is we cannot take a complaint based on lack of resources because that is a separation of powers.

Despite the aspiration towards making disability services more family-centred, it is not the case.  The Cork parents' advocacy network contacted me after repeated failed attempts to meet with the head of disability services for counties Cork and Kerry.  Many family forums in CHO 4 have yet to be established.  When will they be set up?  Will management in CHO 4 meet with the parents' network?<\/p> <p>  Of the 91 teams, how many are currently fully staffed?  How many are 90% staffed?  What is the clinical risk of not having fully staffed teams?  When will teams be fully staffed?<\/p> <p>  I turn to Mr. Reid.  Of the &euro;350 million allocated for waiting lists, how much was ring-fenced for disability?  It was of concern that in the 54-page document, \"disability\" was mentioned just once.<\/p> <p>  A new narrative is being articulated today by the HSE about being unable to provide interventions.  That is deeply worrying.  Mr. O'Regan talked about the legal requirement for AON but nothing else and about the need to strengthen legislation to ensure the HSE can provide better services.  Professor MacLachlan said he is uncomfortable with the lack of funding.  I think we all agree with that.<\/p> <p>  I cannot imagine how hurtful and frustrating it is for families and organisations watching this.  We all know the Department's capacity review said &euro;350 million was needed to meet the unmet needs of people with disability in Ireland.  Approximately &euro;65 million was allocated.  Representatives from the HSE talked about the need for stronger legislation around this and basically said the executive needs to be pushed and forced by claims and different things into providing services that the country can afford to provide.  It is a disgrace that we do not provide those services.  <\/p> <p>  My final question is for Dr. Muldoon.  It concerns one of the things I always come back to when we deal with disabilities on this committee.  The Acting Chair and other members are also on the disability matters committee.  One of the things we hear from individuals, families and organisations such as the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, as well as from the UN special rapporteur and others, concerns the need to ratify the optional protocol on the UNCRPD.  That language is clunky and does not sound exciting but it could realise the rights of many people to live an independent, free life and have access to education and the services they need, which are the services we are talking about today.  It looks like there has to be a legal obligation on the State to provide those services; otherwise, it will not do it.   For the benefit of people watching, the representatives present and public representatives, will the ombudsman elaborate on the importance of the optional protocol on the UNCRPD?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2022032200002#M00500","speaker":"1525"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1647907200,"counter":281,"content":"<p>I will ask Mr. O'Regan about the detail around the CHO.

She made a very important distinction about the importance of responsiveness to families.  There is no excuse for our services not responding to families and their needs, other than being understaffed.  Not a single one of our CDNTs is fully staffed and some of them are only staffed to about 50%.  There is a difference between the capacity to respond and what we have developed, which is family and person-centred services with the new reconfiguration of CDNTs.  That is about the process of delivering both assessments and services and supports.  We are absolutely committed to that ethos and Ireland is quite progressive on a Europe-wide basis in pursuing that.  The distinction between doing that and being responsive to families when they have queries is something we certainly need to address.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy also asked about clinical risk.  Of course, there is significant clinical risk when people are on waiting lists, either for assessment or for interventions.  It has been emphasised already that people can miss milestones and develop secondary disabilities so there is significant clinical risk there.  If we are going to be required to do considerably more detailed assessments of people through the assessment of need process, then the clinical risk will increase because we will have fewer people available to provide the services and supports needed to reduce that clinical risk.

It is so important that we have proper protocols and that all children have this right.  It is in the programme for Government and we need to deliver on this.  There is also accountability within the HSE.  The witnesses can see the anger here.  As Deputies and Senators, we see this every day in our constituencies.  I feel it is getting harder.  There is an issue with communication.  I understand that everybody is doing their best.  That is not in question.  The problem is that there is no delivery and no accountability.  If there is no proper communication, how can we even get back to parents and let them know what is happening?  The HSE is a disaster in that regard.  I am not trying to be rude but trying to get things done is a nightmare.  I spoke earlier about overnight respite.  I understand that with Covid, things had to be pulled.  There will be protests from families outside Leinster House in the next few months about all the different services their children are trying to access, including respite.  Families feel they have been let down.<\/p> <p>  We need a plan, even if we cannot sort it now.  Mr. Reid said this was something he came into, and I understand that staff are working on this.  We need a plan so we can at least tell families what we are doing for the next year, and that while we might not get everything, this is what we are going to try to do.  That is the communication we need.  That way, people will know the HSE is coming back to them.  Right now, they are being ignored.  The HSE cannot ignore these families and children but that is what is happening.<\/p> <p>  We have spoken about the 90-minute assessments.  When people come into my clinics, it takes more than 90 minutes to get to know them, and I still meet them regularly to try to get their issues sorted.  What is the feedback on this?  The extra funding is welcome but we are talking about a 90-minute assessment.  This was brought in by the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte.  What is the follow-up?  What has happened here?  Families are still trying to get answers and they are just not getting them.  This is an issue across all Departments so I am not going to blame the HSE.  All the HSE staff I know work hard.  There is no question about that.  All the bodies, services and agencies I work with are doing their best but much more must be done.<\/p><p>I know Dr. Muldoon spoke about education.  What I find is that within education, there is transport and all the different services as well as housing.  There is not one joined-up service.  This is my biggest issue.  Everybody is blaming everybody, and nobody is taking responsibility.  Everybody in this room is as angry as me.  I am asking Mr. Reid, could we have some sort of responsibility in that this may not get sorted in the next six months but that a plan be set out, that the HSE will work with the different agencies and Departments, and communicate it to the families, the Senators and Deputies so that we can at least work with it.  We are not here to criticise everyone or to make trouble.  We are here to try to fix the system that is broken.  We are trying to help the HSE but if it is not coming back to us, and we cannot do that though our HSE services, we cannot help with solving the problem.  The only way this can be solved is if all of us, the Departments and the HSE, come together and work with everybody.  If that does not happen, we are on a road to nowhere.  The system is failing.  It is failing the children who are most vulnerable and that really worries me.  Mr. Reid might come back in to answer me.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2022032200002#N01400","speaker":"1511","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1647907200,"counter":306,"content":"<p>Sorry, I was not going to answer until the Deputy was finished.

From our perspective in the HSE, we work across inter-agencies.  We put pressure on ourselves and other agencies to deliver with us.  There is no doubt that it is a more complex process because we are, exactly as the Deputy describes, relying on an inter-agency process.

People might not like to hear that, but it will take that period.  It will take a plan each year, which the team has been working on, to make things better.  I fully accept the assessments we did were according to the procedure set out and, last year, we did an increased number compared to the number we have done in many years.

First off, I wish to put forward a proposal.  As a Senator and parent, if I were to bring my child to a service, there should be full transparency in what I could expect, such as what I could do and what the best avenues for me to advocate for my child would be.  In the area where I live, CHO 8, if my son needs X, I should be told that there are X number of children on the waiting list.  We know there is a waiting list but the HSE should tell us where we are on it, what the story is and be fully transparent because parents are in the dark.  I learned last week that a parent can self-refer to a disability service.  I did not know that we could self-refer to a primary care service.  Education and knowledge are power.  There should be a pamphlet and information available as well as a billboard campaign to educate parents and our children and to show them what to expect, what the other therapies that are available, and what the multidisciplinary team means to them in a general sense.  Obviously, we want individualised plans, but what does that mean?  What do these acronyms mean?  It is all nonsense in a way when I just want my baby to be cared for.  This is a proposal which I would ask the HSE to deliver on, to provide transparency across the CHOs, and to tell me as a parent, as a Senator and a representative, what is happening.<\/p> <p>  What will happen to children who have already been through a standard operating procedure assessment?  Will they have to be redone?  Has there been a policy shift in the HSE recently in the recruitment of senior positions in disability services?  I have heard anecdotally that because there are an awful lot of lower level positions, that people have not progressed in their career or do not see the prospects of career progression within the disability service and have, therefore, moved on to areas such as primary care.  I know the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, has been speaking about and pushing for this recently.  Has the HSE gone abroad to recruit specifically for disability services?  Is there a model of incentivisation to bring home our highly trained staff and get them into the public sector, away from private sector?  As someone who used to run my own business, I know that running a business is not all it is cracked up to be.  A safe, secure job in a public service would be very appealing to people who struggle running their own business.  There are many incentives available.  How can we incentivise people, because it is like the chicken and egg scenario?  People do not want to come in because it is under resourced, yet people are not coming in.  How do we make it a positive place to work and a positive place for children to be?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2022032200002#O00300","speaker":"1671"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1647907200,"counter":308,"content":"<p>I will take the last point made by the Senator, then ask some of my colleagues to respond to the other points.  I fully agree with the Senator.  The challenge for us in terms of international recruitment and, indeed, recruitment generally is - I worked for 30 years in the private sector so I know the flexibility one can have outside the public service - that we are governed by public service policy.  There are certain ways in which we can help people come home from aboard.  There is relocation, within certain limits, available for people which we utilise.  It is a difficult and challenging issue.<\/p> <p>  On a general point in terms of incentivisation and recruitment, the HSE is a good place to work.  The health service is a great place to work.  It might not always be perceived that way in the context of the public commentary about them.  I would say to everybody in terms of helping us that sometimes, and this goes for all our stakeholders including the HSE, sometimes we need to present a very positive experience of what people experience when they work in the HSE.  It does not always get out there.  To be frank, people are very reluctant to come into public service jobs now, particularly at senior level as we are trying to recruit.  There is a big challenge for us all to make the public service attractive, to ensure we are getting the right people.  I know that many people would not come into the public service for many different reasons.  However, the Senator is right: it is a great place to work.  There are good conditions and pay and people have good pension entitlements.  That is what we are trying to leverage.  Do not take that as a criticism of any of us, including me.  It is just a general point.  We can create a better perception of what it is like to work in the health system, and it is really good.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2022032200002#O00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Reid"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1647907200,"counter":309,"content":"<p>I will follow up on some of the Senator's other questions.  On transparency with families and the wider community, as well as an education programme, I do not want to keep repeating myself, but a lot of what the Senator talked about is factored in to the work we are doing on our communication strategy.  The overall principle of being absolutely transparent with people is something that we are committed to and is the direction we want to go in.  It is very difficult sometimes for staff to sit in front of families.  It is okay for me to be in a meeting like this and say that we will be transparent in terms of making information available.<\/p><p>I know it is very difficult for individual staff members who are sitting with families to translate that principle into a conversation because they may be conveying a message that is very difficult for those families to hear.

It is likely that the other 46% do not need further assessment but we will also engage with those families to make sure.  We discussed the matter Senator McGreehan raised earlier when she visited last week.  It is really important that parents realise they do not have to go through an assessment of need to access services.  It is not the gateway to services.  With the assessment of need process, a desktop assessment lasting at least three months happens before any referral is made.  Parents can pick up the phone and arrange a direct referral to any team.

I will ask them at the same time in light of the restrictions on time.  I was also on a site visit last month.  I visited a brand-new primary healthcare centre in Tallaght in Dublin South-West.  I found the experience really good.  The reason I had to go to Dublin South-West is that, despite the constituency I represent, Dublin Mid-West, having a population of 120,000, we do not have a primary healthcare centre.  It is in these centres that we are seeking to host these comprehensive multidisciplinary teams.  If there is any update on the provision of a centre in the constituency, I would like to hear it at this meeting.  I agree with Mr. Reid; the staff I met that day were absolutely fantastic.  I found them really passionate about their jobs.  They really care about the services they want to deliver.  However, I felt that they were victims of policy.  For example, the movement of clinicians to contact tracing and testing during the Covid pandemic put them on the back foot with regard to dealing with the waiting lists.  The panel system and recruitment and retention of staff were also worrying for the staff I met that day.  I am disappointed but not surprised to hear that not one of the 91 CDNTs is fully staffed.  It is my understanding that, at the moment, most of these CDNTs are operating with approximately 50% to 60% of the proper number of staff.   Is that the case?  Will the HSE representatives elaborate on that?<\/p> <p>  I know Mr. Reid has answered this question a number of times before but I would again like to hear what concrete plans the HSE has to recruit staff into the service.  At what grade does he expect these staff to be recruited?<\/p> <p>  I will also ask a question of Mr. Muldoon, if that is okay.  On the question of unmet needs that we spoke about before, Mr. Muldoon mentioned that there are five key recommendations in the report on unmet needs.  How many of these recommendations have been met at this stage?  What impact will these recommendations remaining unmet have on services for children and on those children?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2022032200002#P00400","speaker":"1469"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1647907200,"counter":314,"content":"<p>The Deputy is correct that the primary care centre in Tallaght is one of the exemplars with regard to multidisciplinary working and particularly its effects in terms of keeping people out of hospitals and emergency departments.  It is the model we want to see across the board.  I am happy to come back to the Deputy with regard to plans for a primary care centre in his own constituency area because there are very significant plans as to the further roll-out of primary care centres and the procurement of land to facilitate this roll-out.  I am happy to come back to him with specific regard to his constituency to give him an understanding of what the plan is or where the gap is.<\/p> <p>  On the impact, the Deputy is correct.  I am glad that he highlighted something we have not said here today.  People sometimes get frustrated when we say this but the impact of the Covid pandemic has been significant across our health system.  When we look back on it, we might have done things differently.  We will always look back on things in that way.  However, the impact on resourcing was significant.  We had to scale up a system of testing and tracing involving more than 3,000 people and a vaccination system involving more than 5,000 people.  It was a project of a very big scale that had to be done at very short notice.  That did impact on resourcing and we had to redeploy staff for periods.  Having said that, we were anxious to get our school therapists back as quickly as possible.  Once we recruited into those areas, that is what we did, but the Deputy is right; it did have an impact.<\/p> <p>  I will ask Mr. O'Regan to speak on the CDNTs and staffing levels in a moment but I will first make a general point on recruitment.  Our process is to recruit at a local level to the greatest extent possible and to delegate power to the CHO areas to do that, which they actively do.  At a central level, we have put in place a new recruitment model to give us that scale.  We have never before recruited an average of 6,000 people per year but we have done so over the last two years.  That is net recruitment.  As I said earlier, we have recruited a total of 35,000 people.  Our model involves a new recruitment model, further delegated powers to recruit at a local level and the use of a third-party agency.  I will ask my colleague to respond on the issue of CDNTs and staffing complements.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2022032200002#P00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Reid"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1647907200,"counter":315,"content":"<p>At the moment, the average vacancy rate across the CDNTs is approximately 25%.

We are currently in the process of compiling a report on that.  We will be able to share the data with the committee in the coming weeks, once the report is completed.<\/p> <p>  With regard to recruitment, Mr. Reid has mentioned the various strategies that the HSE is engaging in.  It should be noted that the HSE is not the only recruiter of staff for the CDNTs.  Much of the recruitment is also led by service providers.  I refer to both those with a section 38 relationship with the HSE and those with a section 39 relationship with it.  They are also experiencing difficulties relating to the challenges of the availability of staff and so on.  It is important to note that it is not just the HSE that is challenged in this regard.

We have heard that the review of the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs\u00a0Act\u00a02004 commenced in January of this year and is due to be completed in the first quarter of next year.  We wanted to see a review of the language within the Disability Act 2005 to make it more needs-based, rights-based and child-centred in concert with consideration of the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs\u00a0Act\u00a02004.  Mr. Reid stated that he is also supportive of that.  We would like to see that progressed.  At the time, we also asked for the establishment of an independent expert group to really move that forward.<\/p><p>I understand that has not taken place as yet.  We are seeking the co-ordination of a whole-of-government approach.  I know there have been five public hearings at the committee and it has heard from various Departments regarding what has been done.  As Mr. Reid stated, much of the need for diagnosis relates to education.  Our office is doing a significant amount of work in respect of special educational needs and what needs to be done in that regard because without the EPSEN Act coming into effect, there are no individual education plans.  We need to make sure there is co-ordination on a government level.  Reference was made to housing and other facilities that children with disabilities need to be co-ordinated.<\/p><p> As regards additional resources that are required, I am not sure that we know at this stage what human, technical and financial resources are required by the HSE in order to make sure the children who have been mentioned by name here today will be in receipt of services in line with their entitlement under the 2005 Act.  I am not clear on that.  Several figures have been put out, including that &euro;1.1 billion deficit in terms of services.  If only part of the &euro;20 million was allocated to disabilities waiting lists on the ground, that is quite a small amount.  Much has been said about the &euro;7.8 million from Sl&aacute;intecare that was put in to clear the AON backlog last year, but that sum is a drop in the ocean compared with what is required.  I do not know whether we really have an awareness of the resources that are required to make sure children receive those services in a timely manner.<\/p><p> We also made recommendations in respect of standards.  Obviously, the SOP has been discussed at length today.  It is heartening to hear that the High Court judgment has been accepted and there will be a concerted effort to look again at those children who received a PTA under the SOP and to make sure they receive services in time, which is the most important thing.  <\/p><p> Data collection is another issue we mentioned.  There has been progress in that regard.  I am not sure whether the representatives of the HSE wish to comment on that.  We received a letter from Mr. Reid which states there has been progress on data collection and a new database.  What we want to know is who will be able to access that.  Will all clinicians be able to access that database and know at what stage in the process is each child they see?  <\/p><p> As regards family forums, to which reference was made, that is all supportive of making sure that in the first instance all those children need to have access to their therapies and we need to know what are their needs.  Obviously, those needs need to be reinforced within a family or school setting or wherever it might be, but in the first instance they need to receive those therapies.  Although we heard that 91 teams have been set up, they are not fully staffed.  Until that takes place, we cannot move to stage 2 and expect families to step in and perform the role of therapists.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2022032200002#P00700","nonspeaker":"Ms Ciara McKenna-Keane","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1647907200,"counter":318,"content":"<p>I ask our guests to elaborate on the issue of the projected database.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2022032200002#Q00200","speaker":"1469"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1647907200,"counter":319,"content":"<p>The database has been commissioned and is currently in development.

Although it is a great development, will it have enough staff to man it for that community?  That is a concern.<\/p> <p>  The tie-in with schools is important.  If a child does not have psychological services, that may prohibit the child from being in the correct school placement and getting a place in the school because there is no review.

I invite our guests to comment on that.<\/p> <p>  I have had recent experience of almost a row between primary care and disability services as to which was responsible when a child was falling between the two services.  How can that be avoided?  In that case, it was avoided by very high-level intervention, for which I am grateful, but it reached a stage where I had to be completely exasperated that a child was continually without carers at a critical juncture in his or her life.

Those people from the UK informed me that the mortality rate among people with Down's syndrome was six times higher in the UK than in Ireland.

I will not use the names of those involved but I remember visiting a school before the pandemic where I met two parents with eight-year-old children who were in a special needs school and looking for support.  Ten years earlier, those children would have died at birth.  Our medical advances are creating circumstances in which children with special needs are surviving.  We need them to thrive and, as others have said, live their best lives.  We need to be planning for future children and not just catching up with the children who are already in special needs situations.  The whole reason behind Unmet Needs is not to beat anybody up, apportion blame or say anyone is doing a bad job.  It is to try to create a system that works for everybody as quickly as possible.  We have not seen movement as quickly as we would have liked in that regard.<\/p> <p>  The move to progress disabilities, which started 11 years ago, is now in place.  There are now 91 teams in place.  I urge the HSE to take the lessons of the past and not find ourselves asking in five years' time, as we have done for ten years with A Vision for Change, whether full teams are in place.  A Vision for Change became a byword for poor services, which is unfortunate.  I would hate to see that happening.  The thought, ambition and vision are there.  We need to make them happen.  We are asking what we can push the Government to give the HSE and what is clearly needed, whether that includes further education, more courses, classes, recruitment, senior posts and whatever else.  We are looking to facilitate change to provide for the society that the UNCRPD envisages.  We know that the new approach to disability we all should be using is to follow the concept that the society needs to change to facilitate the child, not that the child needs to change to live in our society.  The HSE has a large role to play in that regard.  In order to bring the UNCRPD to life, the HSE and the services that are assessed and provided are crucial.  We need those services as early and often as possible so those children can live their best lives.  I look forward to further engagement on these matters and to the output from the committee.

We now need consistent and focused public investment to ensure higher education in Ireland delivers on our national ambition and international obligations.  Substantial investment in the creation of technological universities has taken place.  However, this has mostly taken the form of one-off investment, designed to assist the development process, or competitive-based funding, which is not guaranteed on a multi-annual basis and does not allow the institutions to \"plan forward\" in spending.  Consequently, not only is there a need for significant multi-annual, long-term investment in higher education generally, there is also a further specific need for the same in technological universities.  Failure to make that investment will inevitably affect the ability of the sector to satisfy the ambitions laid out for it by Government and will hinder the capacity to contribute to the pipeline of skills talent that the country requires.<\/p> <p>  With the increase in student numbers, student support services have faced increasing demands and particularly in our institutions, where such services suffer from legacy funding inequalities.  Given their profile, our students have been disproportionately impacted by the pandemic.  Existing inequalities in housing, income and cultural capital have been amplified.  Students have sought to maintain their learning while dealing with challenges relating to mental health and well-being, poor quality study spaces off-campus and extended periods of isolation that undermined the traditional whole student experience.<\/p> <p>  While technological universities acknowledge and welcome the additional \"one-off\" funding initiatives provided during this time, it is critical that we move to multi-annual funding to enable strategic planning and decision-making, with efficient reporting processes so that these essential services are enabled to devote their time to the support of individuals.  Technological universities urgently require specific investment to embed fully the consent framework and achieve the required cultural changes at the heart of the framework.  This investment would benefit both students and staff.<\/p> <p>  The transformation to technological universities is the biggest educational change of our times.  For technological university employees, that will mean transformation and change also.  We are awaiting the final report from the OECD advising on the academic contract and related matters.  The introduction of professor grades, a workload allocation model to reflect the changing nature of an academic's work, including research and administration, as well as the traditional teaching and learning role, robust promotion structures and new senior management structures will have to form part of that report.  These changes will require significant increased core funding for the sector, which will require a swift response from Government.<\/p> <p>  A further challenge relates to the lessons from Covid-19.  Students appreciated the ability to learn online and there is no doubt that blended and online delivery will feature more regularly in the years to come.  We will need to invest in training and development over the next few years to leverage this potential.  To address this, the recent submission by the technological sector for funding under the national recovery and resilience plan focuses on investment in state-of-the-art digital infrastructure.<\/p> <p>  With respect to capital investment, there is a concentration now on inflation and the costs of living.  For our students, the student accommodation challenge looms large.  The increase in student numbers, including international students, is creating an unprecedented demand for suitable, affordable student accommodation that has been exacerbated by the wider societal housing need.  There is no doubt that increasing the supply of on-campus purpose-built student accommodation could relieve the pressure on the private rented market.  The delays in addressing this matter over the past few years cannot continue.  Technological universities await access to the borrowing framework.<\/p> <p>  The lack of capital buildings investment is of great concern and the public private partnership process currently under way is slow and not delivering the building stock required in the immediate future.  A major capital fund must be allocated and disbursed.  This capital deficit extends beyond the physical buildings into equipment, facilities and information technology infrastructure, including for research and innovation.<\/p> <p>  With regard to research and innovation, part of the development of technological universities is the policy imperative and legislative requirements to grow our research and innovation capacity in support of the regions and, in particular, in support of enterprise.  The main challenge is that core funding is insufficient, so any research and innovation capacity-building funding, while very welcome, is time-limited and being used to fund initiatives that would more sustainably be funded from core.  This presents a particular challenge to establishing the well-resourced research and innovation support offices typical of a university sector.<\/p> <p>  There have been repeated calls for the research and innovation allocation through the recurrent grant to increase from &euro;5 million per year, which has been a static amount since its introduction in 2019, to 5% of the overall sector recurrent grant over a period of five years, eventually increasing to 10% of total recurrent grant, as is the case in the traditional universities.<\/p> <p>  Our students are from many and varied backgrounds and they reflect the increasing diversity of our complex society.  The funding model has been revised but it does not adequately address the diversity of needs in our system.  There is insufficient weighting for student access and no weighting for the smaller student groups that our pedagogical model uses to help such students.  Technological universities cannot simply be funded on the same basis as traditional universities with their well-established pipelines of philanthropy and alumni support.  At a time, therefore, when higher education is under major financial pressure while trying to maintain academic standards, the pressure on technological universities is even greater.  If they are not helped in their earlier stages of development, the opportunity may pass to deliver on balanced economic and regional development and access to education for all.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022032200002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Marian Duggan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1647907200,"counter":340,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for providing me the opportunity to speak about the future expansion of craft apprenticeships and new-generation apprenticeships.  Munster Technological University is the largest provider of craft apprenticeship programmes in the country, with a total of 1,872 craft apprentices due to complete their off-the-job phases in the university this academic year.<\/p><p>Craft apprentices in electrical, refrigeration, plumbing, carpentry and joinery, plastering, pipe fitting, metal fabrication, fitting, motor, construction plant fitting and agricultural mechanics complete phases 4 and 6 in block release mode in MTU.  In addition, MTU delivers post-2016 apprenticeship programmes which offer university degree qualifications.  Currently, over 200 students are registered across six programmes such as the BEng in manufacturing engineering and the BSc in engineering services management.<\/p><p> MTU has a long history of delivering programmes using online learning.  The use of a rich and user-friendly online learning portal has led to an increased uptake in the number of students in our post-2016 apprenticeship programmes.  The flexibly and availability of this service provide blended learning opportunities which enable us to extend the reach of new apprenticeship programmes.<\/p><p> Apprenticeships are central to the mission, strategic remit and activities of the technological university and institute of technology sector.  As a TU it is very important for us to continue our strong partnership and leadership in apprenticeship delivery.  The Technological Universities Act 2018 also highlights this need and sets out our role in this area.<\/p><p> The level of engagement of higher education in apprenticeship provision is significant, as is the level of annual and capital investment.  Higher education providers across the TU and IoT sector provide 60% of all craft apprenticeship off-the-job training, which currently equates to over 8,000 training places.  Furthermore, 65% of all new consortia-led apprenticeships are provided in the higher education sector.  The annual investment in craft and consortia-led apprenticeships in higher education is currently in excess of &euro;55 million.  Some &euro;35.5 million has been invested in capital programmes to deal with expansion requirements in the higher education sector over the past five years.<\/p><p> Apprenticeships are offered at all levels of the national qualification framework, from level 6 to 10.  It is a mode of learning built around an employment opportunity with the learning provided by both higher education and further education depending on the level of the award.<\/p><p> I fully support the new action plan for apprenticeship.  I also welcome the establishment of the national apprenticeship office which is a joint venture between the HEA and SOLAS and reflects the collective participation of the higher education and further education sector in the provision of apprenticeships.<\/p><p> Higher education can play a key role in the transition of current SOLAS co-ordinated craft apprenticeship to a consortia-led model.  The existing collaborative partnership between further and higher education sectors should continue and be enhanced through the new opportunities we now have in the transition process.<\/p><p> The further and higher education sector has great knowledge of the existing centralised craft apprenticeship system and also the existing consortia-led programmes.  The sector is looking forward to the development of a single apprenticeship model and can play an important part in this evolution.  The TU sector though delegated authority is well placed to offer leadership as a result of its experience in programme development, assessment, validation, quality control and the international recognition of university awards.<\/p><p> The main challenge facing MTU in addressing the skills shortage when it comes to apprenticeships is the lack of facilities, such as classrooms, laboratories, workshops and offices.  We receive capital funding for equipment when new curricula are introduced but no funding is provided for new buildings or the upgrade of existing buildings and services to install this new equipment.  Targeted funding to upgrade buildings to support existing and new apprenticeships is essential for the delivery of the apprenticeship targets.  Opportunities also exist to develop new shared facilities with the further education sector.<\/p><p> Finally, I mention the World Skills Ireland event which will be held in the RDS in September 2022.  It is a showcase event for apprenticeships.  It promotes skills and apprenticeship at a national level.  In October 2022, a team from World Skills Ireland will travel to Shanghai in China to compete at the highest international level.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022032200002#D00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tim Horgan","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1647907200,"counter":342,"content":"<p>I thank committee members for inviting me.  A wide range of issues pertaining to the future funding of higher education are being considered by the committee at today&rsquo;s meeting.  My research expertise is relevant to two of these.  I have done research on income-contingent student loans and how they might contribute to higher education funding.  My research in this area was incorporated into the 2016 Cassells report.  I have been involved in research and policy reports on access to higher education.  My comments will address funding and access issues in the context of my work in these areas.<br\/><br\/>The Cassells report concluded that the 2016 level of higher education funding was unsustainable and called for increased core funding of &euro;600 million per year, rising to &euro;1 billion per year by 2030.  Although funding has increased in recent budgets, so have student numbers, meaning that spending per student has not improved.  Reports suggest that the European Commission&rsquo;s analysis of the Cassells review, which remains unpublished, indicates that between &euro;350 million and &euro;400 million in additional core funding is needed annually, a lower figure than the &euro;600 million indicated in the Cassells report, but nevertheless substantial.<br\/><br\/>The Cassells report, to which I contributed, outlined three possible options for increased funding, namely, a model of full State funding; increased State funding with a continuation of upfront student fees; and increased State funding combined with an income-contingent loan, ICL, system.  I will briefly outline the economic view of these alternatives.<br\/><br\/>Although a fully taxpayer-funded system may seem attractive because it provides access to education at no upfront cost to the student, it is ultimately the most regressive option as it entails the biggest transfer of resources from those who have not benefited from a higher education, the lower paid, to those who have, the better paid.  Moreover, this option would entail a continued heavy reliance on tax revenue for any future investment in the sector.<br\/><br\/>Option 2, combining increased State support with upfront fees, as at present, alleviates some of the public cost in the short- and long-term.  However, upfront costs raise concerns about affordability and accessibility.  Although about half of higher education students do not pay fees because they are covered by a fees grant, some of those who do not qualify have incomes close to the qualification threshold and struggle with both fee and maintenance costs.  This is particularly true for families with more than one student in higher education at a time.  Many parents borrow at commercial rates to cover these upfront costs.<br\/><br\/>The purpose of an ICL system is to remove such concerns while also sharing the burden of financing higher education in an efficient and equitable manner.  ICL repayments, which are automatically deducted from the graduate&rsquo;s pay cheque on the basis of monthly earnings, are low or zero for low earners and increase as earnings increase, so they are designed to be affordable.  Income-contingent debt is, therefore, unlike other forms of debt.<br\/><br\/>Although ICLs would eliminate fee-related upfront costs completely, it is my understanding that these have been ruled out by the Minister.  Reports indicate that a reduction in the &euro;3,000 student fee and possibly its eventual elimination has been proposed instead.  Option 1, therefore, appears to be the preferred one.  As mentioned, this is a regressive proposal and implies even greater Exchequer funding into the future.  Perhaps this reported decision is based on the analysis included in the European Commission&rsquo;s economic analysis of the Cassells report proposals.  I look forward to publication of that.<br\/><br\/>I worked with Dr. Delma Byrne and other Maynooth colleagues on a 2014 evaluation of the higher education access route, HEAR, and disability access route, DARE.  This evaluation drew attention to the possibility, suggested by the data, that within the pool of low-income higher education applicants, successful HEAR applicants may be drawn from the relatively more educationally advantaged of that pool.  As a result of some of the insights from this report, HEAR and DARE eligibility criteria were revised.<br\/><br\/>More recently, I was a member of an Irish University Association HEAR review group.  It has proposed amendments to the HEAR criteria, which are being considered.  Through my work on this group, I have become very aware of the practical administrative difficulties in identifying those most in need of targeted assistance.<br\/><br\/>There is more to access than attaining a place in higher education.  It is also important that disadvantaged students complete their degrees and achieve the grades they are capable of, given that there is substantial evidence that degree grade affects future earning potential.  In this respect, I believe it is important to consider the role of maintenance grants in ensuring true access.  In recent years, these grants have fallen substantially in real terms when taking into account increases in living costs for students.  In addition, family income thresholds for grant eligibility have fallen in real terms.  Both of these facts have contributed to rising upfront costs for students and their parents, even those who qualify for both fee and maintenance grants.<br\/><br\/>My experience as a lecturer tells me that this is resulting in an increasing number of students who are working substantial hours in the labour market and fitting their studies around their work, rather than <i>vice versa<\/i>.  This may have been exacerbated by the Covid pandemic.<\/p><p>Although it is difficult to find data on hours of work of students, and especially on how work affects retention and grades in education, I regard the adequacy of maintenance grants as an important aspect of true higher education access.  I note that modest grant increases and eligibility threshold increases have been announced by the Minister recently and that a more extensive review of the grant system is under way.  This is indeed to be welcomed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022032200002#E00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Aed&iacute;n Doris","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1647907200,"counter":344,"content":"<p>I am grateful for the opportunity to speak to the committee.  As I have provided a detailed submission, I will keep my comments to the key points.<br\/><br\/>Universities will play a key role in Ireland&rsquo;s recovery from the economic impact of Covid-19 and the university sector is ready and willing to partner with Government in response to those challenges.  I echo the comments of the CEO of the Irish Universities Association, IUA, who recently observed that the importance of higher education and research was clearly recognised recently through the creation of a dedicated Department.  Today I will highlight why universities require a sustainable and multi-annual funding model to support them in delivering their objective, which is, to educate, undertake research and scholarship, and in doing so, promote cultural, social and economic development.<br\/><br\/>It is generally agreed that the current funding of higher education is inadequate to meet the competing demands of the sector both in a national and international context.  The Parliamentary Budget Office estimates that in 2019, funding per undergraduate student was 50% lower than in 2008.  Between 2008 and 2021, full-time equivalent student numbers in higher education increased by 42%, a rise of 65,000 students.  That growth in student numbers coincided with reduced State investment in higher education.  As a result, State grant funding per student fell from just under &euro;9,000 in 2008 to just over &euro;5,600 in 2021, a reduction of over 37%.  In 2021, the actual increase in direct State recurrent grant funding in real terms amounted to approximately &euro;121 million, a considerable shortfall on the &euro;600 million per annum recommended by the Cassells report in 2016.  It is essential that the overall funding of the system increases in line with the recommendations outlined in that report.  It is also essential that this increase should not be associated with new activity but recognises the actual underfunding of current activity.<br\/><br\/>As noted by the IUA, the role of universities was pivotal throughout the pandemic.  The advanced skills and research knowledge in our third level system and the flexibility in which it was applied underpinned much of the response to the pandemic, both nationally and across the globe.  Without proper recognition and funding of the expertise, knowledge and capacity to innovate that is inherent in the sector, such responses to future crises may not be possible.  We must ensure the funding model for higher education properly recognises the role of universities in research, innovation and scholarship, as well as in the education of the next generation of leaders, innovators and entrepreneurs.<br\/><br\/>I will now turn to the priority of supporting access, diversity and inclusion in our higher education system.  Successive national access plans have made real and significant progress in access.  We now need to see emphasis on inclusion, which requires a holistic approach at institutional level, underpinned by the principles of universal design for learning.  This is best achieved by appropriate funding of all students.  Targeted initiatives are important and play a critical role in the path to embed the principles of inclusion, equity and access, but our ambition must be to transform our system so that all students are treated equitably and the learning experience is universally designed and configured to meet their needs.<br\/><br\/>Many students face significant obstacles in accessing third level and access and inclusion can only happen where barriers to entry are removed.  A key impediment is the inadequate level of support provided through the Student Universal Support Ireland, SUSI, grant scheme.  Recent changes to the system to further support asylum seekers and changes to the travel distances in the context of eligibility are important steps in making the system more accessible.  However, further work is required on the qualifying social welfare payments, the special rate of grant category and provisions that reflect the modern family.  <b><font color=\"#FF0000\"> <\/font><\/b><br\/><br\/>My final point is on support for mental health and well-being as it is a critically important issue in universities for both students and staff.  The challenges posed by the transition to higher education are diverse.  Research indicates that many of the serious mental health issues first emerge in the undergraduate entrants age group.  It is important that there are appropriate policies, protocols and procedures in place for mental health, critical incidents and the appropriate use of emergency response teams.  These policies should be linked to wider polices on the student experience so that an institution-wide approach is adopted and embedded in the campus culture.  It must also be recognised that universities are part of a broader societal context.  While they provide mental health and well-being supports, they are not well placed to provide services and supports that are best delivered through the HSE.  The national student mental health and suicide prevention framework for Ireland calls for an embedded whole-system approach and higher education institutions will only be effective in this area if supports are provided at whole-sector level.<br\/><br\/>I believe we are at a serious juncture.  Without a coherent, multi-annual funding mechanism that enables universities to deliver on current demands, innovate, develop new approaches to teaching and fully support an inclusive and diverse community of learners, the objectives of the national development plan<b><\/b>will not be realised.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022032200002#F00200","nonspeaker":"Professor Mark Rogers"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1647907200,"counter":345,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for the invitation to speak to it.  I will concentrate primarily on the funding issues but I wholeheartedly endorse the comments made by the speakers who have preceded me.  Their contributions have been interesting and important.<\/p> <p>  Ireland benefits enormously from having a young, well-educated workforce.  That drives our economic growth and benefits individuals, employers, society and the State.  Higher education is a critical pillar of economic success and of vital services, including education and health.  Furthermore, research intensive universities play a valuable role in addressing societal challenges, as we have seen over the past two years.  In spite of this, the sector faces potentially existential challenges due to sustained underfunding, particularly over the past ten years.  As a nation, we need to reframe our view of funding higher education to one of investing in our social and economic future.  To quote DCU president, Professor Daire Keogh, investing in higher education is investing in the ultimate renewable resource: our young people. <\/p> <p>  I have been acutely aware of this issue since working on the expert group that was mentioned by Dr. Doris.  That group was chaired by Mr. Peter Cassells.  The report of the group is generally referred to as the Casells report.  That 2016 report highlighted the serious gaps that have already been referred to in core and capital funding and the risks of not addressing them.  Dr. Doris has given the committee the numbers involved.  If one accumulates the gaps in funding that have not been addressed since 2016, we already have a combined deficit in core and capital funding of over &euro;4 billion.  That underfunding is being felt within the system.  The group also recommended an additional &euro;100 million in student support funding.  Those issues have also been well highlighted by previous speakers.  <\/p> <p>  There has been limited additional funding in recent years, largely from an increased national training levy on employers.  That is one of the Cassells group recommendations that has been implemented.  This extra funding has generally been allocated on a competitive basis and targeted towards specific initiatives.  The downside of that is that winning funding requires additional activity and spending by the successful institution.  While welcome, it does not address the inadequate basic funding.<\/p> <p>  I believe the committee's main focus should be on core and capital funding levels for ongoing costs and essential infrastructure.  This basic funding has been diluted by a number of factors, including the severe funding cuts following the financial crisis over ten years ago and the dramatic increase in student numbers.  That increase was entirely foreseen, given demographic trends, and was projected in the Cassells report.  That increase is projected to continue until 2030.  In spite of the increase in student numbers, staff numbers have been controlled throughout the period.  The staff to student ratio, which is widely recognised measure of quality, has increased in Ireland, leaving us well behind other countries.  In 2019, the average staff to student ratio in both OECD and EU countries was 15:1 while in Ireland, it was 23:1, which is a dramatic difference.<\/p> <p>  Another negative factor has been so-called top slicing from overall funding, which means allocating funding to particular initiatives on a competitive basis among institutions and typically involving additional activity and spending within the institution.  That top slicing is taken from the overall Exchequer allocation, leaving less for core and essential costs.<\/p> <p>  These combined effects have eroded quality and undermined the sustainability of the sector.<\/p><p>As a country, we have been layering partially funded initiatives onto an underfunded base.  The <i>status quo<\/i>in terms of funding our higher education system is not a cost-free option.  The funding gaps I have outlined reduce the quality of teaching and learning and of the student experience.  They limit the participation of young people from disadvantaged backgrounds and endanger career opportunities for Irish graduates in what is a very competitive and mobile labour market.  Ultimately, they threaten the overall contribution of higher education to our public services, and to Irish economic and social life and to our future development.<br\/><br\/>We need to protect Ireland&rsquo;s reputation as offering a well-educated workforce.  We need to properly fund the institutions providing that resource.  These institutions can then be both supported and challenged to be genuinely world class and to give our students the opportunities they deserve.  That said, I fully recognise the competing demands for public resources to address challenges such as housing, climate change, and health services, and that household incomes are severely strained.  Nevertheless, for our future, we must invest in higher education to support our continued social and economic success and to create a sustainable, innovative, and high-quality future.  That investment, combined with the committed leadership and staff that I have witnessed in the higher education sector and, of course, our talented students, will deliver Ireland&rsquo;s ambitious national goals.

My first question to the witnesses is how much damage do they think has been done?  It is five years after the Cassells report was published.  It has come back from the EU but we have not had sight of it yet.  I would prefer if we had sight of it.  We could have much more productive conversations around this, therefore, we are stabbing in the dark somewhat.<\/p> <p>  Ms Horan put it starkly.  The accumulated shortfall in investment since 2016 - &euro;2.7 billion in recurrent spending and &euro;2.2 billion in capital spending - means we are almost &euro;5 billion behind.  We are falling behind all the time, and this is very concerning.  We know it has been happening, yet we are told that we have never invested as much in higher education.  We need to look beneath, as we are, in terms of the increase in the number of students and, as stated in the presentations, the cut.  The truth is that it is 37%, and 50% less in real terms, per student.  We need an honesty around where we are at if we are to dig down and see what we need to do here.  We need to be honest about the opportunity cost.  We need to be honest about where matters stand.  We can no longer cover things up with once-off funding and making big announcements and stating that everything is wonderful.<\/p> <p>  We do a massive disservice to the entire population when we cover up what is happening in the funding of higher education.  We need to see it as an investment rather than a spend.  If we continue to see it as a spend, we will do a disservice across the board in terms of research, innovation, scholarships and all the other matters Ms Horan mentioned.  What has been the impact of this underinvestment in education, working conditions, and research?  What impact has it had on the public nature of third level education?  I will ask Ms Horan to comment on that first.  How do we compare internationally?  How much are we falling behind internationally while we are standing still or going backwards in terms of investment in higher and further education?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022032200002#G00300","speaker":"1501"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1647907200,"counter":349,"content":"<p>It is a complex question.   I do not work directly within the system.  I am chancellor of DCU and chair of the governing authority.  I have, however, observed the system through my work with the Cassells group, as well as through work I did with the HEA.  My observation is that the system has been incredibly adaptable, has really flexed and adjusted and has lived within very constrained means.  However, I also observe that it is, therefore, under stress.  That stress is showing in terms of the staff and the leadership within the sector.  It is becoming increasingly difficult for them to stretch those resources.  They have been really innovative in drawing on alternative sources of income.  Many of the colleges have worked successfully to attract international students, which has bolstered resources, but that is a finite possibility and if we damage overall quality, our ability to compete internationally will decline.<\/p> <p>  We have stretched the resources close to breaking point.  That is evident in the areas of infrastructure and equipment.  We are looking to improve the existing infrastructure to cope with the challenges of Covid, for example, and to have better lecture facilities and so on, but also to cope with climate change.  There is a core Government objective, as I said in my submission, to make sure that we are operating within our climate goals.  That requires refreshing investment in the infrastructure.  The system has adapted very well and has been very innovative in finding alternative sources of revenue, working well with enterprise, finding funding for research and borrowing.  Within the university system, we have been able to borrow in order to invest in infrastructure but that creates pressures in terms of operating commercially.<\/p> <p>  The system has taken a complex set of measures.  I am hopeful that students have not suffered irreparable damage.  As to the quality of the graduates, the academic system is well curated and monitored in terms of the quality of the programmes.  I have a level of confidence about that, but pressures exist among the staff and within the infrastructure and - Dr. Doris referred to this - the pressures on families to meet the costs.  Within the Cassells group, we also recommended an extra &euro;100 million towards student support.  We believed it was important that it was targeted.  We are seeing increasing numbers of students who have to commute because of the cost of accommodation.  There are complex issues regarding that, about which we in DCU have worked closely with the Department to make sure it understands the complexities of increasing student accommodation.  Students are increasingly working to support themselves in college.  That again is putting pressure on the students.

As I said, I believe Covid has exacerbated that.  The fact that we had to move learning online so suddenly gave students an opportunity to work.  That masked what was happening to accommodation costs during the period of Covid.  When they came back, they found the accommodation to be completely unaffordable.  Maynooth University has a lot of first generation students.  It has more than the other universities and is similar to some of the institutions in the IT sector in that regard.<\/p><p>We have more students on grants, for example, than any of the other universities.  Perhaps I am more exposed to it than people in other universities would be, but I have had students tell me they cannot have continuous assessment done because they are working full-time or have been working very long shifts over the previous week and will try to get the work done next week, to give an example.<\/p><p> It is definitely impacting on students.  When we assess access, we find that Ireland has quite a good record in getting students into higher education, by international standards.  We should be very proud of that.  The HEAR scheme has been particularly useful in that respect and the universities worked very hard in this area.  However, but that is not all there is to access.  It cannot be the case that there are students who, because of their background, cannot fully engage with their education.  We can be as innovative as we want but if students cannot engage with the education we are providing, that is very much a problem.  They will not get the grades they should get and grades matter for earnings.  They are one of the main returns that students seek.  They are not the only thing they look at when they go to university but an important aspect of it.  If their financial position is causing a systematic downgrading of their achievements, we should be very concerned about it.  This issue could be rectified very quickly.  Most students do not want to be working and know they should not be working so much but the financial pressures at home dictate that they have to do so.  It is either work or give up education altogether.  I know there is a review of the SUSI grant under way and I hope it will be part of a serious effort to address the big shortfall in the cost of attending higher education for students because it is a big and growing issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022032200002#G00800","nonspeaker":"Dr. Aed&iacute;n Doris","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1647907200,"counter":355,"content":"<p>If I may add to that, I fully agree that access to the university sector nationally has been extraordinarily well done but the issue is about participation while students are in college and their getting the real benefit from that.

My notes are a bit all over the shop, but that speaks to the quality of the submissions we received.<\/p> <p>  If it is all right, I will focus my questions on Dr. Doris because what she presented is probably the most challenging to my own world view.  I mean that in a good way.<\/p> <p>  Option 1, as she sets out, is that State funding is regressive.  That challenges my world view in the context of how the State should operate.  I would like to give her the opportunity to dig down into that and also into option 3, which involves income-contingent loans.  I am focused on the idea of access and on people from non-traditional backgrounds who find it more difficult to access third level education.  In the case of option 1, Dr. Doris states that is regressive.  I understand that in the sense that she says we are paying fees for people who can afford it.  I want to give her an opportunity to expand on that in terms of taxation revenue, as opposed to funding, and whether it stacks up as regressive.<\/p> <p>  Option 3 relates to income-contingent loans.  This is something I have spoken about at the committee before.  In that context, I worry about social capital.  I worry about a student who is looking at the prospect of third level education and the idea of accumulating that amount of debt is a barrier too high for them.  If you come from a middle-class background and there is sufficient family income, you might be comfortable with that level of debt from a social capital viewpoint.  Could Dr. Doris point me to any international evidence or research which backs up her assertion that this is a more progressive model?  I ask that because what she said challenges my world view, in a good way, and I want to give her an opportunity to expand on it a little.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022032200002#J00800","speaker":"1617"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1647907200,"counter":374,"content":"<p>I will speak about option 1 first, which is no fees and full public funding.  It is regressive because, basically, what that mean is that it is not free; it comes from the taxpayer, and taxpayers are made up of lots of people, including low-income individuals who have had no opportunity or who have not gone to university.  It is their taxes, as well as the taxes of the better off, that are going to fund an education system that they have never benefitted from, so in that sense it is regressive.  All taxes are being used to fund higher education, which is an unusual good from an economic point of view.  It is both a public and a private good in economic terms.  What that means is that the public sector derives significant benefit.  As Professor Rogers mentioned, the return on investment at a public level is substantial, but it is also substantial at a private level.  The return on a higher education is substantial to the individual.  Because people are paid more, they pay more taxes, but that does not fully compensate for it.  From an economic point of view, it makes sense that the cost should be shared by both the individual private beneficiary and by the State.  Even the most libertarian economist in the world would not argue that it should be privately funded.  Nobody would argue that.  If you try to fund a higher education system entirely privately, you get substantial underfunding and inadequate access.  It is not an efficient way to do things, so it makes sense for there to be a substantial public sector investment.  Option 3 in the Cassells report, the income-contingent loan system, and option 2 both involve both private and public contributions.  They are preferable from an economic point of view.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022032200002#J00900","nonspeaker":"Dr. Aed&iacute;n Doris"},{"type":"speech","time":1647907200,"counter":375,"content":"<p>Are we confident in standing over the idea of regressive versus progressive when we talk about the overall distributive effect, which is where I would try to understand progressivity versus regressivity?

We probably should not call it debt, because it is not debt in any kind of normal sense.  You only repay it if you have the wherewithal to repay it.  In every income-contingent loan system in the world, there are people who do not fully repay their debt and some people who do not repay any of their debt because they have fallen on unfortunate circumstances, for example, they are unemployed or they have a disabled child they need to take care of.  All of those things are taken into account.  All the evidence is that what affects people's decision to participate in higher education are upfront costs.<\/p><p>At the moment, people are incurring debt to go to higher education.  However, it is not an income-contingent debt.  Their parents are basically taking out the loans.  They are taking them out at commercial rates, especially if they have more than one kid in college at the same time.  We are talking about really substantial repayments that have no income-contingent element to them.<\/p><p> The Deputy asked about international evidence and the case we always look at when we look at income-contingent loans is the UK, which is the country closest to us that have them.  It is also the country that makes the biggest mess of them.  The problem with the UK is not that the loans are income contingent; it is the fees are so high.  Because the fees are so high, the loans amount to a graduate tax.  Most people will be repaying them for their whole working lives, because they accumulate so much debt over their working lives.  They charge extremely high fees.  They increased fees from &pound;3,000 to &pound;6,000; I think was the first jump they made, although I could be wrong about that.  They made substantial jumps to get up to &pound;9,000 from the initial &pound;3,000.  Yet, there was no change in access by the lower socioeconomic classes that people had been worried about.  The reason for that was that people understood that the fees would be repaid in the future and they are not upfront costs.  As well as this, they would only be repaid if they could afford to repay them.  Therefore, a striking aspect of the research on this is that it did not put people off going to college.<\/p><p> A more reasonable income-contingent loan system is in Australia.  It was the first one and it has been ongoing for years.  There has been much research on access there and it has had no impact.  Fluctuations in the fees have had no impact on access by lower socioeconomic class students.  There is therefore much evidence that income-contingent loans do not affect access negatively, whereas upfront costs do.  The situation we have at the moment is that we have a lot of upfront costs.  We have the &euro;3,000 fee for approximately half of the student population.  We have the costs of attendance, which are inadequately covered by the SUSI grant and which need to be topped up.  That seems to me to be worse than the income-contingent alternative. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022032200002#J01500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Aed&iacute;n Doris","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1647907200,"counter":382,"content":"<p>I had any number of other questions for other witnesses presenting.

Some of their public statements have been very welcome.  I am taken by some of Mr. Horgan&rsquo;s comments on pressure points and pinch points that MTU are facing.

As the economy changes, the number of apprentices employed changes as well.  As a result, it is difficult for us to predict numbers coming through the system.  Currently, we have a serious lack of space, as the committee members have seen.  While the quality of training and education is superb, unfortunately, the infrastructure dates back to 1974 and it has not really been modified since.  We have been asked to increase the number of craft apprenticeships coming through the system.  We have responded.  Yet, at present we have approximately 274 hours of teaching online because we simply do not have the physical space to bring craft apprentices on campus.  That might be an indication of the pressure we are under at the moment.  Our labs and workshops are overcrowded in terms of space and equipment.  There are no recreational areas for students.  These are the current pressures.  With increased numbers coming through, we are at a maximum and cannot go beyond numbers we have at the moment.<\/p> <p>  Given that we are the largest provider, I am worried about how we can respond to the increased numbers coming through.  Over time, we have worked closely with the further education colleges in Cork, in particular, the Cork Training Centre in Bishopstown, where we have looked to share facilities.  We believe that that is an option where we could co-locate workshops and labs to benefit both the further education, FE, sector and the higher education, HE, sector.   There are multiple other benefits as well.  There is the fact that as a TU, we can offer to apprentices who graduate from our university a qualification that is internationally recognised.  In addition, and this is a really important point, it allows pathways for apprentices through from level 6 to level 10.<\/p> <p>  In a nutshell, to answer the Chairman&rsquo;s question, we need funding for infrastructure to deliver the needed buildings, facilities and workshops.  As well as this, a closer integration with a strategy around the co-locating and co-delivery of programmes with the FE sector is a wise way to invest in the future of craft apprentices.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022032200002#K00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tim Horgan"},{"type":"speech","time":1647907200,"counter":386,"content":"<p>Before I move to another member, how does Mr. Horgan feel we can encourage more females into craft apprenticeships?

The link allows students to click on to the <i>apprenticeship.ie<\/i>website, which is a huge improvement as it allows employers to feature vacancies and to link with students.  There have been other improvements and the new apprenticeship office will guide us into the development of a single apprenticeship system.  It is getting the message out there.

That said, there is also an opportunity with the technological university sector offering pathways for apprenticeships through to level 10.  That is a key point and is really important.  Parents can see that industry is cyclical, especially the construction industry and if students begin an apprenticeship as a plumber, they do not know where that industry will be in five years' time and the student may end up unemployed.

Gender stereotyping goes beyond apprenticeship.  My career in the ESB demonstrated to me that it is a real issue in the context of craft apprenticeships and I know how difficult it is to overcome that. The 30% Club and DCU worked together over the last few years to build an internship for trainee teachers.  This may sound counter-intuitive but they set up paid internships over the summer to enable trainee teachers to go into industry where they could experience all aspects of working in science, technology, engineering and mathematics, STEM, careers.  That was done because we feel that teachers and career guidance need to adjust to modern society and the modern career options.  It is not just about technology but about the broader areas and about gender stereotyping.<\/p> <p>  An issue that is very relevant to this committee's work is the human capital initiative.  This is competitive funding made available through the National Training Fund.  It is a really good initiative but the areas of education and nursing were excluded from it.  I do not see why that should be the case because initiatives related to how we are training our teachers can have a really long-term impact on all of these issues and people working in the non-traditional areas would accept that.<\/p> <p>  In relation to refugees, I cannot comment in depth on the issues but I know that DCU has already mobilised a virtual working group to look at the issues for the institution and for the refugees and how we can moderate that.  We have been an initiator of the concept of the university of sanctuary and as Ms Duggan has said, this is really important for all refugees.  Obviously we are acutely conscious of it at the moment and there will be a challenge for all institutions in this space but we proactively are engaging on it.  Again, this speaks to the agility and adaptability of the higher education sector.  Without waiting to be asked, the institutions are looking at what they can do and how they can make sure that they cope as well as possible and cater for the new arrivals as well as possible.  <\/p> <p>  That whole question of gender stereotyping is fundamental because 50% of the talent is female and we need to use that across all sectors.

I have a couple of comments.  The local response is one thing, but if we are taking in a whole range of refugees coming from Ukraine, it is very likely that the numbers involved could be very substantial.  The locations in which they end up may not be determined by them particularly.  It is very important that a national approach is taken with some sort of warehousing or portal, because we want to be able to align the students with where they are in terms of access to the education.  This is something we have certainly been pushing.<\/p> <p>  The other comment I would make is that it is not clear to me yet, and I have written to the Minister but I have not had clarification, whether the Ukrainian students who were already in Ireland will fall into the same group now and be eligible for the EU fees.  We must recognise that there will be Russian students, Belarusian students and others, who are also being impacted, and we must be very compassionate in how we manage those students too.<\/p> <p>  With regard to SUSI, I agree that the ongoing review is welcome but, I suspect, is not radical enough.  There is a simple reality around recognising what it costs to go to university, not just the fee component but also the living costs.  If we want those students who were striving to get to university to go, then we must recognise that cost.  All of the areas by which the grants are applicable, including the salary and income thresholds, really do need to be radically looked at in terms of what is a real issue.  To get a special rate grant a student must be on very low income.

I plead the Fifth on whether it was me.  This brings me to my first point.  We were talking about the impact that working has on students' grades.  The south-east and north-west regions have traditionally suffered from many students travelling outside those areas to access third level education.  A great transfer of wealth is involved in that.  Something I have never seen quantified is the impact that working has on students' grades.  Perhaps those data exist, and I have not seen them.  I wonder if there are grade implications, for example, if someone from Waterford accesses education in Cork, lives in student accommodation and makes his or her own dinners and whatever else, rather than having the dinner handed to him or her before an examination, the washing done or whatever else.  We know that grades follow through into income expectations in later life and this feeds into the discussions we are having about the cost of living.  I hope the technological university model will help to address some of the education deficits in the north west and south east, but some students will still choose to travel outside those regions.<\/p> <p>  Following up on the ICL loans, as well as the social capital concern I raised earlier, we also have a culture of emigration and, hopefully, return.  If students have debt waiting for them in Ireland, will that dissuade them from repatriating?<\/p> <p>  I agree with Professor Rogers on the issue of Ukrainians.  For that reason, it is important that this committee addresses how our education system is going to deal with the influx of Ukrainians.  Something that should be borne in mind in respect of third level education is that none of us knows how long it will take for the conflict to play out in Ukraine.  We are very much hoping that Ukrainian children who arrive here will be seeking to return within a shortish timeframe.  However, we can expect people who arrive and access third level education here to stay, and I hope they will stay, which would extend the timeframe involved to three or four years.  That must be considered.  <\/p> <p>  I an also conscious that we have only spoken about State funding today.  We did not talk about private or philanthropic funding.  This speaks to a point Professor Rogers made about the freedom of the third level sector to educate people to access jobs and roles, as opposed to doing applied research.  If private funding is accessed to design a course, is that going to limit our education outcomes?  This is much too broad a question to address now, but what role is private and philanthropic funding playing in our third level sector?  Is that affecting the educational outcomes and the decisions we make in respect of designing educational outcomes as well?  That is more than enough questions for five minutes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022032200002#O00500","speaker":"1617"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1647907200,"counter":425,"content":"<p>I am conscious that when we bring in students they bring in their whole person.

I suspect we have students commuting two hours each way to attend third level education and it is difficult to imagine that it is not impacting their ability to study.<\/p> <p>  On the questions on philanthropic funding, at an institutional level, there are probably three or four ways in which philanthropy impacts on education.  The first concerns the capital programmes.  We seek and, thankfully, receive generous donations from individuals and sometimes from companies to support us in pursuing the capital development programmes we wish to undertake.  Much of that is about building the capacity we need to support growth and I would argue it is, in part, subsidising underfunding by the Government.<\/p> <p>  We also have a large cohort of alumni continuously giving small amounts of money.  Much of that funding is used to support students in financial need and to give scholarships.  A great deal of it, to the tune of several million euro each year in my institution, is going to support students from disadvantaged backgrounds or those who are socioeconomically disadvantaged.  We also have some philanthropic donations that sponsor professorships or chairs.  We are extraordinarily careful to ensure such funding is not reflected in the academic programmes or in academic delivery.  Academic freedom is an essential component of the university and higher education system.  In addition, there is also occasional funding of a programme, or at least of students in a programme, which would be quite targeted and not in the same vein.  It would be about supporting an industry partner in respect of its training needs within its industry, rather than being focused on creating a broader profile of education in support of that industry.<\/p> <p>  We are thankful that there are generous donors - individuals and companies - who help us.  We are also cognisant of ensuring that in doing so we are undertaking the right programmes and not just taking money for money's sake.  Funding must be for a project we value and want and for which we see a strategic need.  I particularly welcome that we have a large body of alumni giving small amounts, such as &euro;10 or &euro;15 a month, because that builds up to quite a pot of money and that again helps to underpin ways of addressing the underfunding of the system, through the SUSI grant system, for example.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022032200002#O00800","nonspeaker":"Professor Mark Rogers"},{"type":"speech","time":1647907200,"counter":428,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for appearing before the committee.

The Cassells group was made up of representatives of the sector and there was quite a strong consensus view based on the international research and experience that income-contingent loans were equitable and manageable.<\/p> <p>  We were not suggesting that any other country's model should be copied but that a model should be developed for this country, recognising the issue, for example, that was mentioned by Deputy &Oacute; Cathasaigh around emigration, and all of that should be built into the model to make it workable for this country.  That would be a very important aspect.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the role of the private sector, as Professor Rogers said, we all seek to attract funding directly from private individuals and, again, we are very grateful for that kind of support.  Wealthy individuals obviously can contribute more, but funding also comes from our former students and other friends of the university.  That money is used to support our activities directly and, in particular, to support access for less privileged students and support for them while they are in college.<\/p> <p>  With regard to people coming from different locations, even if they are living near their institution, I have been shocked to hear the word \"lonely\" used quite a lot in recent times about students.  Sometimes, it is not just about practical supports; it is that they are feeling lonely.  There is evidence that the demand for counselling services, for example, has doubled in some institutions.  We need to be concerned about all aspects of the well-being of students, whether it is the lasagne going back on the bus on Sunday night or ongoing personal individual supports.<\/p> <p>  As Ms Duggan said a number of times, we need multi-annual secure funding so that we can build up those resources within the institutions.  It is not for want of trying to get private funding.  We have corporates as well that support particular programmes and particular investments.  At the end of the day, however, the State is, in my view, the core underwriter of higher education.  I am really hoping the debate in this committee will tackle that fundamental issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022032200002#P00900","nonspeaker":"Ms Br&iacute;d Horan"},{"type":"speech","time":1647907200,"counter":434,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Horan very much.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022032200002#P01000","speaker":"1553"},{"type":"speech","time":1647907200,"counter":435,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for coming here today for the discussion, which has been very productive.

I am chairperson of the Irish Association of Social Workers.  My colleague, Mr. Eoin Barry, is chair of the IASW Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services, CAMHS, Special Interest Group and a systemic psychotherapist and social worker working in CAMHS.<\/p> <p>  By way of background, the Irish Association of Social Workers, IASW, was founded in 1971 and is the national representative professional body for social workers.  The IASW currently has a membership of 1,600 social workers.  We are an active member of the International Federation of Social Workers, which represents professional social work associations from more than 55 countries.  The association is a registered company run by a voluntary board of directors, which is elected annually by the membership.  The board is supported by the activities of council representing the principal areas of social work activity in Ireland, including children and families, mental health, probation, primary care, disability, medical social work and so on.<\/p> <p>  As the representative group for social workers, we welcome, in the main, the recommendations of the report of the expert review group and the overall changes proposed, including those previously suggested by the IASW and now incorporated in the draft heads of the Bill.  We also broadly welcome the provisions of the Mental Health (Amendment) Bill, as outlined in the draft heads of the Bill currently under consideration.  We believe these changes, in general, will improve mental health services, including giving an amplified voice to service users, both adults and children.  <\/p> <p>  We would emphasise the following points.  Under the definition of treatment, the proposed replacement of the word \"medical\" by the term \"clinical\" more accurately reflects the broad range of care provided as opposed to using a solely medical lens.  We would emphasise that every involuntarily detained person should have a right to a psychosocial assessment conducted by a CORU registered mental health social worker.  Regarding a psychosocial assessment completed by a mental healthcare professional member of the multidisciplinary team, we propose such assessments be completed by a CORU registered mental health social worker.   Mental health social workers are best placed to complete such psychosocial assessments as they have an appreciation for complex systemic factors assessment, risk management and the various therapeutic approaches.<\/p> <p>  Regarding assess to forensic assessments, &ldquo;In the instance that a person is detained to ensure safety of others, access to a forensic assessment needs to be made available\", this is especially important in the context of families where there is risk of domestic violence, intimate partner homicide, parricide, filicide and intra and extra familial child homicide.<\/p> <p>  The new Act should be informed by the guiding principles of trauma-informed care relating to manual or other forms of seclusion and restraints.<\/p><p>We would be particularly concerned by reports that mechanical restraint has been used in some of the inpatient child and adolescent facilities.  We would ask that this legislation explicitly prohibit the use of mechanical restraint on children.<br\/><br\/>We note the legislation mandates the Mental Health Commission to visit and inspect every community mental health service at least once every five years.  We would ask that it is clarified that this encompasses community mental health services for all age groups.  We would also ask that the Mental Health Commission&rsquo;s remit is extended to regulate low-, medium- and high-support HSE hostels.  We would ask that all inpatient facilities are mandated to have a space where families can meet in privacy.<br\/><br\/>We support the change of terms in the report, including the use of mental disorder in appropriate contexts and the renaming of mental health review tribunals to mental health review boards.  This is an important change as people often felt they had done something wrong if they needed to attend a tribunal.  Such changes in terminology are positive and welcomed.<br\/><br\/>We also welcome the changes related to provision for children.  We would ask that there is further exploration and development of issues related to the transition of children to adult mental health services.  This area can be inconsistent around the country, leading to serious issues in both child and adolescent mental health services and adult services.<br\/><br\/>We welcome the changes regarding consent for children.  We seek appropriate clarity in the legislation of what would happen if a young person consents to treatment, but their guardian opposes it.  We would also ask that the family or guardians of a young person are specifically included in the care of young people in inpatient facilities.  This would ensure the best possible outcome when they return home.<br\/><br\/>We welcome the importance placed on advocacy and the role of the guardian <i>ad litem<\/i>.<br\/><br\/>We strongly suggest that the provision of services be recovery focused, human rights based as well as trauma informed and based on international best practice.  They should also take full account of the psychosocial context and issues arising.  In that context they should incorporate registered mental health and social work practitioner inputs.  In the context of development and implementation of the legislation this will require increased resources in the area of mental health and social work services.  I again thank the committee for the invitation.  We are happy to answer any questions members may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE32022032200002#B00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Vivian Geiran","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1647907200,"counter":445,"content":"<p>I am grateful for the invitation to discuss the general scheme of the mental health (amendment) Bill 2021.  I am Dr. Lorcan Martin, vice president of the College of Psychiatrists of Ireland and a consultant specialist in general adult psychiatry.  Accompanying me and representing the college today are Dr. Imelda Whyte, consultant specialist in child and adolescent psychiatry; Dr. Atiqa Rafiq, consultant specialist in later life psychiatry; and Dr. Norella Broderick, senior registrar in learning disability psychiatry.<\/p> <p>  The College of Psychiatrists of Ireland is the sole accredited training, education and professional body for psychiatry in Ireland, representing more than 1,000 psychiatrists, both specialists and trainees, across the country.  The mission of the college is to promote excellence in the practice of psychiatry in all its components - training for doctors to become specialists in psychiatry, lifelong continuous professional education and advocacy for evidence-based standards of care in mental health services in order to achieve a fit-for-purpose contemporary service for Irish people.<\/p> <p>  While obviously there are other pieces of legislation governing the delivery of mental health services in Ireland, the primary legislation is the Mental Health Act 2001 which focuses primarily, though not exclusively, on the management of patients who are admitted for treatment involuntarily.  As members are aware, one of the necessary reasons to review and revise this Act is to update the legislation to bring it in line with human rights, including the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, and for it to be compatible with the, yet to be fully commenced, Assisted Decision Making (Capacity) Act and other Irish legislation.  The college actively supports such a review.<\/p> <p>  While the rights to autonomy and dignity are fundamental, so too is the right to person-centred, evidence-based care, and to the timely access to such care.  This includes support for mental health challenges and distress and for treatment of mental illness and disorders.  Similarly, families and carers have the right to expect timely and appropriate treatment for their loved ones and those in their care.<\/p> <p>  We believe the heads of Bill, while going further to incorporate human rights principles into mental health legislation, have gone so far as to now potentially prevent seriously ill people from getting the treatment they urgently need.<\/p><p>We note agreement with many issues and concerns highlighted by our colleagues in the IMO and IHCA who presented to the committee on 8 February 2022.   <\/p><p> I draw the committee's attention to a number of figures.  In 2020, just over 15,000 people were admitted to psychiatric units or hospitals.  Just under 2,500 of these were involuntary admissions, of which just under 950 were admitted for the first time.  These people, by definition, represent the most seriously ill.  By far the biggest number in this group had diagnoses of schizophrenia, schizo-affective and delusional disorders.  Followed by this are other serious illnesses, namely mania and severe depression.  All of these conditions, whether it is a first or recurrent episode, are best managed by early and comprehensive intervention and specialist treatment to maximise the potential for recovery, restore function and optimise quality of life.  While specialist, community-based treatments are sufficient for most people attending mental health services, people with severe illness and more complex needs require a much greater level of support and care to manage life-changing mental illnesses.  Unfortunately, this may include involuntary admission.  Detailed reports with data are available.  However, these figures represent real people, with real illnesses and real suffering.  Consequently, it behoves us all to alleviate that suffering and treat illness in whatever way is necessary.<\/p><p> Such is the concern of the members of our organisation that the current draft Bill will deny patients and people treatment and care that the college held an EGM recently, which is unusual.  We also surveyed our full membership and the results indicate the same concern.  A summary of those results has been provided to the committee.  A total of 80% of survey respondents believe that the proposed revisions would impact on their ability to treat patients effectively, while 70% believe that the proposed revisions will have negative implications for families because they will increase barriers to care for those who have concerns about mental illness in their relatives.  More than 70% of respondents believe the proposed revisions will increase their workload, increase burnout, and impact further on the already major issue of staff recruitment and retention in psychiatry, while more than 60% of those surveyed believe that the revisions will increase risk to staff in inpatient units, which would be likely to impact staff recruitment and retention in this environment.<\/p><p> Committee members have our detailed submission, provided to the Department of Health, which outlines the specific parts of the draft heads of Bill we believe are not tenable or require further examination, explanation or reasoning.  I will refer to some specific issues.  The first concerns the increased risks for patients, families and society.  The Mental Health Act allows detention on the ground of the presence of a mental disorder and either presence of risk or need for treatment.  The proposed revised criteria state that admission must be &ldquo;immediately necessary for the protection of the life of the person, for protection from [...] serious threat to the health of the person\" and protection of others.  We argue that this will increase the risk to patients and families, as the proposed amended Act cannot be used until there is a serious risk.<\/p><p> Families and health professionals who are familiar with the person can detect early signs of relapse, which is, unfortunately, sometimes accompanied by lack of insight in the patient.  This allows for families and health professionals to begin to seek treatment for them before the inevitable progression of the illness.  However, serious mental illness such as psychosis or bipolar disorder under the proposed revisions will need to be advanced to the point where there is a risk to life or health before treatment can commence.  There is no other illness where doctors have to wait for a patient to deteriorate to a life-threatening state before treatment can be initiated.  Furthermore, sometimes individuals can be severely mentally unwell with an inability to function. However, if they do not seek treatment, they will go untreated indefinitely, until they present a serious and immediate risk.  The stipulation that someone with severe mental illness who lacks capacity cannot access treatment unless they pose a serious threat to themselves or others is also stigmatising for mentally ill patients.<\/p><p> A core feature of all illness is the impact it has on functioning, no more so than severe mental illness.  It is recognised that untreated mental illness will cause the person to be increasingly less able to socially function, potentially leading to homelessness, substance misuse and imprisonment.  This is one of the main drivers, if not the main one, behind mental health legislation: to ensure that those who are unable to function and have impaired capacity due to severe mental illness have a safety net.  Those with severe mental illness also disproportionately account for those who are homeless or in prison.  The removal of this safety net will increase this and further marginalise those with severe mental illness.  This finding has been recognised since the 1930s and is referred to as Penrose's law where, as the number of psychiatric inpatients goes down, the number of prisoners goes up.  A clear example is that, although there are many remarkable sights in San Francisco, sadly one of these is the number of psychiatrically unwell homeless patients, whose right to health and treatment is not being met.<\/p><p> Another concern is a delay in patients accessing treatment.<\/p><p>Currently, an application for detention in hospital under the Act can be initiated by a range of individuals, including family members, emergency department staff and members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  There also is provision for applications to be made by individuals designated as authorised officers, but this was only used in the minority of cases due to the difficulty in accessing such officers.  The draft heads of Bill provide that only authorised officers can now initiate an application.  We have a number of concerns about this.  Some services do not have access to any authorised officers and, in the remainder of the country, there are insufficient numbers of officers to provide 24-7, 365-days-a-year cover.  The cost implications of having sufficient authorised officers available are significant.  Additionally, it is likely that there will be marked difficulties recruiting such individuals.  Family members will no longer be in a position to make an application, even though they may be the ones who know the person best, are best placed to identify early warning signs of relapse in the quickest time and may wish to be involved as much as possible in the care of their loved one.<\/p><p> The revised proposals make considerable additional demands on consultant specialist time, which will have obvious knock-on effects on patient care.  Based on the survey of our members, the impact on consultant time is estimated to be an additional six hours-plus per week, which will lead to cancellation of clinics and increases in waiting times.  As members know, the services already are stretched and overburdened and we struggle to provide the support and care people deserve.  Currently, there are approximately 485 approved specialist consultant posts but more than 100 of them are unfilled or do not have a specialist in post.  We need more than 835 consultant specialist psychiatrists by 2028, based on current and projected demand.  In the meantime, between 276 and 350 of those currently in post are expected to retire or leave the services over the next ten years.  Half of our consultant psychiatrists are over the age of 50.  The proposed new Act, in its current form, will be a significant disincentive to psychiatrists taking up posts in this jurisdiction.  Quite simply, we are training doctors to leave. <\/p><p> I want to highlight the main aspects of the proposals that will impact on consultant time.  The current Act specifies that mental health tribunals, which are to be renamed mental health review boards, must take place within 21 days of the commencement of a detention.  However, under the proposed revisions, the review boards will take place within 14 days.  This will inevitably lead to more consultant time being taken up with the administrative work associated with the frequent and more numerous sittings of boards.  Time spent in review boards is time not spent in outpatient clinics, on ward rounds or supervising junior staff in training.   Most important, it is unclear what benefit will be gained by the patient from this change.  Review boards will take place at a time dictated by the Mental Health Commission to suit the panel, not, as in the present situation, where the time and day of the tribunal is agreed between the consultant and the commission.  It will be extremely challenging to reschedule clinics if review boards are scheduled at the same time as outpatient clinics.  This will further affect the ability to prioritise working with our patients, which is, after all, why we become doctors.<\/p><p> There also will be an impact on safety in inpatient units.  College members have expressed concerns in this regard arising out of the significant restrictions, punishable by fines, convictions and a potential criminal record, on the management of agitated patients.  No behavioural management of any type will be allowed on voluntary patients and, if it is necessary to detain such patients, no treatments are allowed in the period during which the application process is taking place, which could take 12 hours.  Should a voluntary patient become agitated on an inpatient ward, which is a common occurrence, there will be very serious risks to other patients and staff, as the latter will no longer be able to provide treatments that previously were possible while the application process is taking place.<\/p><p> A further concern among members is the current proposed provision for the criminalising of breaches of the Mental Health Commission regulations relating to seclusion and restraint.  First,the threshold for the use of seclusion or restraint should be clearly set out in the parent legislation.  As it stands, under the draft heads, the commission seems to be given the power to make any changes it wishes to the use of seclusion and restraint.  It is important to have this power clearly defined as a matter of policy in the legislation.  The regulations, as developed by the commission, deal with matters such as record-keeping and documentation, frequency of clinical review, etc.  These are not matters properly within the purview of the criminal law.  A separate matter is the misuse of the power to initiate or continue seclusion or restraint.  Any offence relating to the abuse of this power should be clearly set out in the primary legislation and should include a requirement to show malicious intent or intention to misuse seclusion or restraint. <\/p><p> Regarding admission of children to approved inpatient facilities, the current Act provides important protections for children in care and subject to court orders.  The new draft Bill is silent in relation to these vulnerable children, leaving them without the protections currently afforded to them.  The proposals allow for children to be brought directly to approved inpatient facilities by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  This is not in a child's best interest.  Just because a child is presenting in crisis does not mean he or she has a mental illness.  Children require appropriate assessments, including medical, in an appropriate setting. <\/p><p> I thank members for their time and their consideration of our views of proposed legislation that is complex and also, we believe, seriously flawed.  In its current iteration, it will make it harder for psychiatrists to do their jobs, exacerbate the current recruitment and retention crisis and, most important of all, make it more difficult for seriously ill patients to be treated and to return to their lives and their loved ones.<\/p><p>My colleagues and I represent some of the varied specialties in psychiatry and, between us, we treat people from early childhood through to late old age.  We are all deeply passionate about providing the best possible outcomes for those in our care and it is for this reason that we have such concerns about the proposed amendments to the Mental Health Act.  We will be happy to answer the committee's questions and to provide any further explanation it may require.

Obviously people come in only when absolutely necessary and are made voluntary, or are discharged as soon as possible.<\/p> <p>  However, moving on to the Senator's question, it is very important for people who suffer from mental illness to be as involved as possible in their management.  For the vast majority of people, they have a good awareness of their illness and are able to engage with the mental health services as fully capacitated individuals.  The difficulty arises when people no longer have that level of capacity.  We would obviously expect that this particular Bill, regardless of its format, would work in conjunction with the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act and that every possible support would be put in place for the individual to involve themselves in their own treatment and to have supports, advocates and any necessary aids they would require to advocate on their own behalf or to understand what is going on.<\/p> <p>  As I have said, the difficulty arises when people become so ill that they no longer have that level of capacity.  I am speaking from personal experience because I had a family member who had a very serious mental illness.  While he was never a threat to himself or anybody else, he would deteriorate to a point where he required hospitalisation involuntarily.  What would happen, and again I do not want to make this too personal, is that he would stop taking his medication and every effort would be made to have him take it.<\/p><p>He would stop, deteriorate and eventually would require involuntary admission, when he no longer believed he was ill.  The difficulty arises when people no longer believe they are ill and are at risk of social embarrassment and their lives coming apart in terms of their ability to function.  I can give another example of a lady I care for who never becomes an immediate and serious risk of harm to herself but would socially embarrass herself in the community because she becomes unwell, stops taking her medication, gets into trouble with the law and so on.  When she comes into hospital involuntarily and is treated, she recovers and then a package of care is put in place.  It is important to put as many supports as possible in place for people to be involved in their care.  We talk about patient-centred or patient-focused care.  The patient must always remain at the centre of our practice, whether by a doctor, nurse or allied health professional.  That is very important.<\/p><p> Supporting families and carers is very important also in terms of helping them to identify when people are becoming unwell and to engage with the person so that they may perhaps prevent the illness getting to the stage where somebody needs to come to hospital.  Mental illness is incredibly complex unfortunately, as I am sure members are aware.  So many different things are at play, whether it is the biology of the illness, social circumstances or adverse events.  It is important for us to put everything in place that would enable the person to engage in their own treatment and make sure all the supports are available, but also then to have a safety net for when everything else fails.  That is what we are talking about with involuntary admission.  It is a last resort.  It is the \"when everything else has failed\" approach.

Senator Conway was hoping to hear specific examples.  There are many provisions in the proposed legislation that we are happy with, as set out in the submission from the college.

There is obviously the right to be involved in one's own healthcare and the right to liberty and so on that we are focused on.  However, we also want to balance that against the right to treatment and to access treatment in a timely manner.  We want to vindicate that right as well, and that is a big issue for us today.  In terms of specific suggestions, we would not recommend changing the current standard for involuntary admission because the threshold has been raised and that is a concern for us in terms of people&rsquo;s right to access healthcare.  The second issue is who can initiate involuntary treatment.

We see patients where they live, in their homes, in nursing homes and day centres.<\/p><p>It is a small fraction of patients who require the protection of the Mental Health Act in order that they can access treatment when they need it.<\/p><p> As Dr. Broderick said, and as Dr. Martin indicated in the submission, the old age psychiatrists have a particular concern about the change of the threshold of admission and, as the Senator just mentioned, balancing it with human rights.  It should not be the case that the focus becomes so severely in its entirety on patient will and preference that you lose sight of years upon years of learning and good clinical practice guidelines which advise that you start the treatment as and when it is clinically indicated and you aim for full restoration of occupational social functioning of the adult.<\/p><p> Section 8, which deals with who can be admitted under the proposed legislation, deviates so much from the good practice guidelines in many ways that the fraction of patients with most severe mental illness who require treatment under the Mental Health Act and who can access such treatment under the Act will no longer be able to access it.  If they do, if they were admitted so late, which would not be clinically or ethically right, in waiting for the time when that criteria was satisfied, within the course of recovery, the capacity and the insight may not recover.  Then we are into a different round about continuing the detention of these patients.  You cannot do it; you have to discharge the patient based on the current proposed legislation, which means there will be serious deterioration of the patient-doctor relationship falling out from the care plan and poor outcomes all along for the elderly person and for the patients in general for whom we are advocating.<\/p><p> There has to be a balance struck.  We believe the current Mental Health Act to some degree absolutely respects that balance.  There have been issues, and it is admirable to see the thinking and the incorporation of the emphasis on the patient&rsquo;s will and preference.  However, you cannot ignore years and years of medical research, good clinical practice guidelines and the right of the patient to get the treatment when they need it.  That balance has to be struck.

A concern that the vast majority of parents talk about is how involved will they be once they reach adult services.  Often, that is a fear.  However, the reality is that adult services involves and integrates families into the care of young adults.  What we, as clinicians, are talking about is that this would be clarified in the eventual legislation.  How would it operate?  Really to emphasise the role of families so that working with families and young people to resolve it should really be a key part of this and would be best-evidence treatment.  It will be a fear for parents and for young people.  If somebody attending CAMHS is approaching their 16th birthday, there are issues involved.  This is a scenario that is likely to arise.<\/p><p>We suggest that there is a role for a conversation between families and the young person, which happens anyway.  To clarify, we emphasise the importance of families being the best advocates for young people in these situations.<\/p><p> In addition, as legislators, committee members have to consider the many young people who do not have family backgrounds and who are in care.  There is also the issue of young people in direct provision centres etc.  We emphasise the importance of advocacy services, especially for those young people who might not have advocates, to look for the service or to know what treatment young people are seeking.  Those are the kinds of areas.  There is the situation where a young person is in a family and is involving the family in that conversation, and the situation where young people, unfortunately, might not have the support of families and the need to make sure they have access to the correct advocacy service to address that.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE32022032200002#H00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Eoin Barry","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1647907200,"counter":463,"content":"<p>I am conscious of my time.

There is also provision for legal representation in that a solicitor would be appointed as well.  In the actual day-to-day operation of the Act, the young person's voice is communicated to the judge through the guardian<i>ad litem<\/i>and parents are also offered legal representation in those situations.<br\/><br\/>A young person who is willing to be admitted to hospital but whose parents are not in agreement is something that happens regularly enough.  I work in an inpatient unit and we are on the receiving end of these situations.  As our colleague from the IASW suggests, the first option is to try to work with the family to see if we can support them in some way in their decision-making to ensure that their child receives the most appropriate care.  Sometimes, when the family meets with the inpatient team, their concerns and fears might be reduced, they might feel that the care is appropriate and they will give it a trial for whatever period to see if it will help their young person.<br\/><br\/>It is also the case that we are ethically and professionally bound, if there is a young person who has a mental illness who is not going to recover or receive the treatment he or she requires in the community, and it is incumbent upon us, to use the Act in that regard.  Sometimes, the use of the Act can take it away from the family.  Instead of a young person, and we sometimes see an adult too, stating that a family put him or her in hospital and consented for him or her to come in, there is a judge, somebody who is quite separate in the District Court, who listens to all the evidence and then makes a decision.  That can work quite well for families.

That is one of the big problems.  From speaking to junior colleagues in training and people who have just qualified to become consultants, I know they are finding the current situation quite difficult already.  If something like this were to be added in, they will start thinking about the fact there are other places they can work.  That is going to be a problem.  We could suddenly wind up with a shortage, regardless of how many millions of euro are put into the system.  We are aware that the mental health portion of the health budget is way lower in Ireland than in most other places and we would look for an increase in funding.  However, it is not just about funding.  It is about providing the wherewithal to make jobs attractive.  It can be very difficult to fill posts.  Many of our consultant posts are already vacant and if we are looking to double the number between now and 2028, difficulties are likely to arise.  <\/p><p> I mentioned that the threshold for admission will be immediate and serious risk.  The problem with somebody who becomes unwell and does not display an immediate and serious risk is that that person can easily become a very serious risk.  I do not want to dwell on any individual instances but we all know of some very tragic cases over the last number of years where people might have had a sense that somebody was unwell but would not necessarily have been aware of the severity of that risk.  That is where the difficulty arises.  As Dr. Rafiq said, raising the threshold to that extent is going to cause big problems.  I can almost guarantee that tragedies will happen because it is very easy to go from being unwell but not at risk to suddenly being at risk, or to go from being unwell and the risk not being identifiable to something tragic happening.  That is one of the biggest concerns we have about that change in threshold.  Not only will people who require treatment and have a right to it not get it, but also there is that added risk.  Ironically, the risk threshold has been set as the key to admission but risk can change.  That is important.  Anyone who does risk assessments will be able to say what a risk is now but I could see somebody today and something awful could happen tomorrow because I do not know what will happen between today and tomorrow.<\/p><p> We can talk all we want about putting more resources in, such as more psychiatrists and so on, but fundamentally this comes back to seriously ill people.  The Bill primarily revolves around people who are going to be involuntarily admitted.  By definition, these people are very unwell.  No psychiatrist, from a moral or ethical standpoint, will admit somebody involuntarily unless the person really needs it.  That is partly for practical reasons because it involves more paperwork, but also we have a massive duty of care to our patients and the doctor-patient relationship is something fundamental that goes back millennia.  First, do no harm.  If we are going to bring somebody in and deprive them of their liberty, we want to be really certain there will be a significant benefit to that in getting that person back into their life, functioning, living with their loved ones and getting back to work or to college.  That is the core of it.  It is about providing the best possible service in the fastest possible way to the people who most need it. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE32022032200002#K01200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Lorcan Martin","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1647907200,"counter":481,"content":"<p>Dr. Martin mentioned risks and change and I agree with him on that.

There need to be policies that work between the two different services in order that they work together and there is agreement about where young people transition.  There has been a lot of debate about 18 as the age of transition, particularly around the updated Sharing the Vision document.  There is debate over whether we should have a young persons service, going from adolescence up to 25, or a child and adolescent service with an adult service to which people transition at 18.  The problem is that while 18 is legally a very important age consent-wise, in the life of young people it is actually quite an arbitrary line.  A young person could be in the middle of his or her leaving certificate year and could have been going to CAMHS for years and in some places he or she might go straight into adult services.  That creates an issue.  The other problem is when a young person presents in a mental crisis a month before his or her 18th birthday.  Do such people go to CAMHS for a month and then transition to adult services, or does the adult service take them for that month?<\/p> <p>  This does not necessarily require legislation but it requires very clear protocols between the different services so that every young person, regardless of where he or she lives in the country, knows the way it should work.

It is something that must be addressed in order that young adults know well in advance.  They should not be worrying at 17 that they will not get the supports they need or will not be accepted into a service.

Imagine a situation where there is a young person - I am going to talk about a young person because I work with younger people - who is acutely psychotic, a danger to himself or herself and potentially a danger to the other people in the environment.  We know the young person is psychotic and needs medication but will not take that medication willingly.  In that situation, the option is to let a very difficult situation progress to a point where somebody gets hurt, possibly another young patient in the environment, someone who might only be 11 or 12, or to make a clinical judgment call that this is a psychotic presentation, that the young person can be treated with medication but is not currently able to co-operate to take it orally and requires an intramuscular injection.  For that to happen safely, a restraint might be necessary.  It is important not to make general statements that restraint is bad and seclusion is bad.  They have their role and their place and there are specific guidelines and protocols in place by the regulating authority, which is the Mental Health Commission.  It collects data on the use of restraint and it monitors its use closely.

Part of the issue is that the different professions, rightly in my opinion, need to have their own chains or lines of accountability but at the same time, within a multidisciplinary team there needs to be somebody who has clear responsibility in terms of leadership or governance in certain areas.  My own professional background includes several decades in the criminal justice system and even there, where multidisciplinary teamwork approaches operate, it is essential that the different members of the team identify who is responsible for what area of work and that they are supported to do that.  The overall point I am making is that within a team, there must be a clear co-ordinator, leader or manager and that the different disciplines within that team need their own respective lines of accountability and governance, which should add to the overall effective functioning of the team.

The Deputy referred to matters such as out-of-hours services, admitting patients and so on.  Consultant psychiatrists have a specific set of skills and very extensive training.  They have a remit within their contracts as clinical team leaders.  The difficulty will arise when another professional disagrees with the consultant psychiatrist about whether somebody needs to come in.  How is that going to be resolved?  If somebody needs to attend out of hours, we have an on-call system whereby we are available at any time to see somebody who is seriously ill.  The same thing will have to be arranged from a logistical point of view.<\/p> <p>  More fundamentally and philosophically, we have a very specific set of skills and specific training.  We are trained not only in mental health; we are also trained as doctors.  Nobody presents purely with mental illness.  They are going to present with other illnesses that may compound the mental illness.  They are going to present on medications from their GPs that may interact with psychiatric medications or that may, in fact, be a part of the cause of the so-called mental illness presentation.  That is why the consultant is uniquely placed to be clinical team leader.<\/p> <p>  I totally echo what our colleagues from the IASW are saying.  It is entirely appropriate for individual professionals to have their own line manager and accountability.  A well-functioning multidisciplinary team - and I feel blessed to work in one - is not simply a bunch of professionals working together.  It is a bunch of professionals dovetailing together to provide the best possible outcome for a patient.  There will be overlapping roles where people help each other out but also a clear delineation of individual roles and functions within that team.  It also involves a common vision and moving forward to provide the best possible outcome for a patient.  If governance is shared, that system begins to fracture.  People need someone to whom they can turn for a focus.  They need someone they know has the background and training for the overall maintenance of the welfare of the patient.  That is where the consultant is uniquely placed.<\/p> <p>  No one is saying that other people should not have a voice; they absolutely should have.  As Dr. Whyte said, everyone brings their own unique perspective and set of skills and that is what makes for a functional team.  There are a number of issues around redefining the multidisciplinary team.  Working as a multidisciplinary team as currently defined, if well resourced, well supported and working well, is a very good way of working.  I have seen that to be the case.  The whole issue of individual accountability within professions and supervision and training are important.  I have, unfortunately, seen situations where people come in to jobs as, for example, managers of a particular allied health profession without a background in mental health.  That causes real problems and it is very frustrating then for the people who work below such a manager because they turn to the manager for supervision and, in fact, the manager know nothing about it.  It is not only important to have adequate supervision but adequate supervision by people who are in a position to supervise.  I absolutely endorse what Mr. Barry and Mr. Geiran have said about having well-resourced teams with individual accountability for the professions and which pull together at a clinical level with a single vision under a clinical team leader, who I believe should be the consultant psychiatrist for the reasons I have outlined.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE32022032200002#P00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Lorcan Martin"},{"type":"speech","time":1647907200,"counter":508,"content":"<p>I am going to infer from what Dr. Martin has said that he broadly agrees with some of the concerns that were raised previously.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE32022032200002#P00300","speaker":"1559"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1647907200,"counter":509,"content":"<p>Yes, I do.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE32022032200002#P00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Lorcan Martin"},{"type":"speech","time":1647907200,"counter":510,"content":"<p>I know a number of people have already touched on this area but I want to go back to the concerns that have been raised around the change in threshold when somebody is involuntarily detained.

That is important.  Depending on when that study was done, a person may have been involuntarily detained but thereafter developed capacity over a period of time.

The vast majority of patients who are admitted under the current legislation are not the ones who are at serious and immediate risk of harm to themselves or others.  The bulk are those who require treatment under Part 3B of the current Act.  Those people require treatment that is otherwise unavailable in the community and admitting them under the Act would benefit them to a material extent.  The bulk of patients coming in would lack insight and capacity but would not necessarily be at immediate serious risk.  As they are treated, their capacity improves.  Best practice would be that when somebody reaches that threshold, the whole issue of whether they should be involuntarily detained anymore comes into play.  That is why we have the option of regrading somebody from an involuntary patient to a voluntary patient.  My understanding is that psychiatrists do that.  I know psychiatrists who at the first available opportunity it is reasonable and safe to do so would convert someone from involuntary to voluntary.

A consultant psychiatrist would see those patients regularly and reassess their capacities, specifically their capacity to remain in hospital as a voluntary patient, because many people when treated will be able to make a decision.  They may think they are not very well at the moment and should stay in hospital.  In other cases, the consultant psychiatrist may decide, in consultation with a patient and his or her family, that while the patient is not well at the moment, he or she could be managed in the community with supports.

While it will have an impact on burnout, recruitment and retention, the primary concerns we have around the Bill relate to patients getting the treatment that they require.  I know I am harping on it a little bit, but they have to be the focus of everything.  As Deputy Hourigan rightly points out, burnout is an incredibly complex thing.  I do not know anybody in the health service, who is doing their job properly, who does not experience some amount of burnout.  It is to do with demand exceeding supply, under-resourcing and people not being available.  When someone goes on maternity leave, they are not replaced.  When someone retires, it takes three or four years before the post is permanently filled again.  The list goes on as to why burnout might happen.  However, the inability to treat one's patients is going to have a significant impact on people.  If patients are not able to get the treatment they need it will cause problems in society at large and cause stress for families.  That will result in more people sitting and waiting in emergency departments and more people homeless or in prisons.  Then there is going to be the added level of frustration on the part of the doctors who want to treat these patients and find they are unable to do so.  In terms of burnout, the proposed Bill is only one component, but it is a very important one.

This has been raised at other sessions on pre-legislative scrutiny as well.  It would be hard to argue with that.  It was also stated that there should be clarity on mental health services for all age groups and that the remit of the MHC would be extended in a number of areas.  The IASW is not the only group to have suggested that.  It is very welcome, but what I notice is that none of the groups so far has come up with any constraints around how those inspections and reports can be used.  For example, the witnesses rightly say that the facilities should have a space for families so that they can meet in privacy, which is a very good point.  I would not argue with that for a second but if we put that requirement in an inspection and a facility does not have it, considering that we are all living in the real world and we have a dearth of health facilities of this nature, have the witnesses considered that the Mental Health Commission needs to put some constraints on how the reports can be used so that they do not lead to closures or the removal of beds based on inspections?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE32022032200002#R00300","speaker":"1559"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1647907200,"counter":521,"content":"<p>Specifically on a private space for families to meet in inpatient facilities, we would consider that as an important issue, partly because the Constitution expressly puts a lot of importance on families, but it is also the case that when families are in that kind of distress it is very important for them to have a private space to meet.

In particular, in the context of human rights, which both ourselves and our colleagues have been emphasising, I would refer to something Dr. Martin said earlier about services being a safety net for when everything else fails.  That is a very important point for a number of reasons.  In Ireland we traditionally had various bodies or services acting as a safety net.  We had decades when we had far too many people in psychiatric hospitals and other institutions.  When that pendulum swung, as Dr. Martin said, we ended up with the number of people in prison going up, because they ended up as the safety net for when other measures were failing.  In this proposed legislation, we have a once-in-a-liftetime chance to make significant strides in the specific area of mental health services.  It is not just about legislation.<\/p> <p>  Going back to Deputy Hourigan's question, the legislative change must be based on principles, values and ethics.  They are very important, but even all of those good ingredients will not be enough, we also need to have implementation following on from the legislation.  As has been said various times, we must also consider the issues that are being addressed by the legislation and otherwise in a systemic way because, as we have said repeatedly today, it is not just about adult services, child and adolescent services, medical practitioners or social work practitioners.  It is not just about this piece of legislation.  We need to take into account the UNCRPD and the assisted decision-making legislation.  There are significant areas of overlap which make dealing with the issues we are talking about a lot more challenging and complex, but we have to take that on.  This is a really positive move to develop the mental health services we have and to put in place modern, evidence-based, trauma-informed and human-rights-led legislation we can build on.  As I said earlier and as our colleagues stated, with the best will in the world - and the best legislation - unless it is adequately resourced and structured, we will not derive the benefit.<\/p><p>Everybody in the room ultimately wants this legislation to benefit the people who use the service, their families and wider communities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE32022032200002#S00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Vivian Geiran","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1647907200,"counter":533,"content":"<p>I would echo what everybody has said about the human rights focus in the legislation and I think everybody here is in favour of it and would want to protect human rights.  What we are advocating for is how we find the optimum balance between various different and almost competing rights at times, for example, the right to liberty and the right to autonomy sometimes versus the right to access care when needed.  One issue in the legislation that has been raised as an area of concern among learning disability psychiatrists concerns the provisions on research.  For example, the proposed Bill prohibits research with respect to any patient who is unable to consent, which I can understand in terms of the desire to protect people from exploitation in research.  However, if we consider, for example, a person with a severe learning disability, who will never realistically have the capacity to consent, there is no way for research of any sort to be gathered with respect to such persons' needs, what they need to access healthcare and to know what treatments they need.  The way this has been approached in the UK is that where it is in the person's interest, there is provision for that person to be allowed to take part in research.  With the new capacity Act coming in where capacity can be supported, that might be a more helpful way of approaching the research issue.  That is just one example of where we do not feel the balance has been correctly struck by this proposed legislation and we would argue for some tweaking of it if that makes sense.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE32022032200002#T00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Norella Broderick"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1647907200,"counter":534,"content":"<p>I thank the members for their unloaded questions and apologise, on behalf of the college, for sounding like what might come across time and again as being negative or more critical of the legislation but we are advocating for our patients, especially the most seriously ill ones.  From the point of the capacity in the capacity Bill, some of the concerns of psychiatrists dealing with later life psychiatry are that, in its current state, the proposed legislation is very deeply contingent upon a fully functional capacity Bill, implemented with all of its supports in place, and it is not trying to achieve something in its own right, parallel to that Bill.  If the proposed legislation were implemented as such, if there was a patient with severe dementia, who was admitted at a time when that person needed psychiatric nursing, a safer, calmer environment, for a short time where that intensive treatment and care is needed, after that it can potentially turn into a safeguarding concern because following a few weeks, the patient may no longer require that level of care and treatment but the patient still lacks capacity.  Section 14(a) of the proposed legislation basically suggests that if two consultant psychiatrists agree a patient lacks capacity, the patient can walk out and one just lets the patient go.  We have determined the patient needs treatment and care, that is the prerequisite of that section at this point in time, and the patient lacks capacity.  It is important to remember how essential it is for this law to address those gaps and meet in a space where those protections are in place for the patients for whom we are caring.<\/p> <p>  To return to the threshold for admission, one of the concerns we, as psychiatrists dealing with later life psychiatry, have is that the proposed legislation does not speak for or provide for many patients who require treatment under the Mental Health Act.  For example, it is the nature sometimes of severe mental illness that it does not involve harm to someone else or to the person and it does not involve a serious harm to health that is being proposed in section 8 in the proposed legislation, but there are all kinds of serious harm, as Dr. Martin, alluded in his opening statement.<\/p><p>For example, a patient with mania, who has been under our care, was ready to buy a piece of land, having already lost a considerable amount of money due to a severe lack of insight because of the nature of that illness, which is an episode of an illness.  He had left the house a few times, had driven unsafely and demanded he would only return home if so many thousands of euro were handed over to him to make certain purchases.  There are all kinds of harms one must consider.  Under the proposed legislation, that patient who was admitted and treated and who is now functioning extremely well would not have been able to do so.  The law must have the needs of the patient at its heart and soul.  I agree with Deputy Hourigan that it should not be driven by resourcing but should be driven by a much better balance between the will and preference of the patient and what it is the patient's best interest up to the level of good common sense, protecting and safeguarding the rights of the patient based on evidence and good clinical practice.  The law needs to speak for the patient first and foremost.  Those are the two main concerns.  <\/p><p> As has been said time and again and we cannot say it often enough, we need to address the exclusion of families and carers.  Psychiatrists dealing with later life psychiatry work very closely with family members in many cases and the majority of patients would not have it any other way.  They would want their families involved.  The families have been excluded to a point where there is no provision in the proposed legislation that they can even request an authorised officer assessment or initiate some kind of mechanism where such an assessment can take place.  The legislation needs to provide for that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE32022032200002#T00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Atiqa Rafiq","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1647907200,"counter":536,"content":"<p>Regarding the increased threshold in the proposed legislation, I work in CAMHS and I am mindful of young people with eating disorders.

Dr. Martin is saying he would not wait for any other patient to get to such an ill stage.

That is the most important thing.  Often you will see someone becoming unwell and they will still have capacity.  They will have the capacity to say they do not want a particular treatment or to go to hospital and if they have capacity, you have to respect that.  The difficulty we have with the legislation in its current format is that there is a subgroup that no longer has capacity but that is also not a risk to themselves or somebody else.  They no longer have the level of insight required to realise how ill they are and it is that group which we are particularly concerned about.  The immediate and serious risk of harm to self and somebody else is easy to identify.  It is generally telegraphed, verbalised or seen and observed by family, carers or whoever.  There will be examples of people who are becoming increasingly more depressed or who perhaps are displaying the warning signs of a relapse and schizophrenia.  If those people have capacity, you have to go along with them.  You can advise, support and psycho-educate them but if they still have capacity, they have autonomy.<\/p> <p>  There is a subgroup in between that no longer has that level of capacity but that does not represent a serious risk of harm to self or others.  They are the ones who do not get the treatment to which they are entitled but to which they do not have the capacity to refuse.  They would tend to make up the bulk of our involuntary missions and they are an at-risk group because, as I said earlier, when you do a risk assessment, it is a risk assessment for now.  We do not know what will happen tonight or tomorrow so we cannot sit tight and watch somebody progress because by the time they lose capacity or insight, they are already seriously ill.  You are waiting for someone to get more seriously ill in that scenario.  You might not be around to deal with it when that immediate and serious risk kicks in.  Families and carers may be so used to the individual's behaviours or idiosyncrasies that they do not notice the subtle changes that indicate a serious risk, and that is where the tragedy happens.  The other issue is that even if a risk never occurs, there is this patient going around who is seriously ill and who might be spending recklessly, as Dr. Rafiq mentioned.  They might also involve themselves in reckless sexual behaviour, which puts them at all sorts of risk.  I have seen patients standing naked in the street or in the local shopping centre when they have become unwell and the Senator can imagine the sheer level of social embarrassment for that person when he or she becomes well again.  There have been situations where people have behaved like that and then attempted suicide afterwards when they realised what they did.<\/p> <p>  There is a significant cohort, however small, of people who require that level of intervention, namely, involuntary admission, who do not represent the traditional, immediate and serious risk of harm to self or others.  The Senator is right that when someone has capacity, they must be negotiated with.  You advise and educate them, you give them your opinion and you involve advocates, carers or whoever else they trust, and you encourage them to make the best possible decision.  You cannot make sure they make the best possible decision because even if people make unwise decisions, if they have capacity it is their decision.<\/p><p>I am trying to conceptualise examples.  Dr. Martin mentioned scenarios like being naked on the street.  Without breaking anyone's confidentiality, what kind of actions would not fall under a serious risk to someone or others but that Dr. Martin believe would be reasonable enough to involuntarily detain someone?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE32022032200002#V00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Lorcan Martin","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1647907200,"counter":545,"content":"<p>That lady I spoke of is a real case.

There is a level of social embarrassment and difficulty in that.  Then there are also people who do not develop the more dramatic presentations but who maybe just do not look after themselves, sit at home, do not eat properly, do not exercise, become socially withdrawn, do not go out, do not take care of their personal hygiene and develop ulcers and do not get seen to.  These are all real cases; I have not manufactured them for an example.  This is the sort of stuff you are looking at.  For example, recently I saw someone who did not come to the attention of the services, unfortunately.  When we saw her she was not an immediate and serious risk of harm to herself but she had dreadful leg ulcers and was ferociously malnourished because she had not been minding herself and that was secondary to her depression.

A patient we treated last year went to the accident and emergency department first and his firm belief was that any moment now he would be kidnapped, tortured and killed.  These things are more common than we think.  He would sit at a place and not move from there.  He was of the belief that imminent harm was going to come to himself.  More and more people who he previously trusted were getting embroiled into the delusional belief so he had been eating and then he stopped eating from the hands of certain people.  He deteriorated and this is an example of depression in older adults.  The Senator might have heard of the The Irish Longitudinal Study on Ageing, TILDA, and depression is a common condition.  What is specific about older adults, which Dr. Martin touched on, although I do not know about the age of this particular patient who he treated, is that cognitive deficits, memory problems, application of attention over time and self-care decline pretty quickly, even before people meet the threshold for the Mental Health Act 2001.  I would argue that even now these patients will sometimes lack insight and capacity but will come to the services rather late.

I work with young people and people who are reaching the age of majority.  When we consider the prognostic implications for the young person, there is a whole lot of evidence to support that the duration of untreated illness in presentations such as psychosis has very direct implications on how one manages the prognosis and recovery.  The greater the duration of untreated illness, the greater the risks.  From what I see day to day, this is a cohort who would be at risk of not being included in the context of requiring treatment.  I know there is talk of them maybe taking their medication at home, but for the small group of people we are talking about who have these difficulties this is not an option because they are too unwell and they do not have insight.  The Mental Health Act is very important for this small group.  Mr. Geiran has said that hard cases make poor law, but we do have a responsibility for the most vulnerable and the most severely unwell.  In this instance we are not talking about the vast majority of people who attend community services or even those who attend inpatient services.  We are talking about a very small number of people who require this and for whom, without that care and treatment, would not get it.<br\/><br\/>Especially as it pertains to children, the way that it is done is a court process and a legal process.  It is not about a tribunal.  One applies to a judge in a District Court.  It is a very comprehensive way of dealing with it.At times, if one is going into court it might be for a young person with an eating disorder and we might be going back very regularly because the young person with the eating disorder might be in hospital for a period of nine months.  It is extremely important because it is due process and everybody's views get heard.  We are ensuring that somebody independent is weighing up the evidence around what the person needs, what the person wants, what their parents want, and what the guardian <i>ad litem<\/i>is recommending.<br\/><br\/>I repeat the concern around the threshold, that there would be people who do not get the care and treatment they need.<\/p><p>We need to remember that the vast majority of people who attend mental health services attend as outpatients.  We could have hundreds of outpatients and there may be four, five or six inpatients at a given time, and maybe even fewer.  Many of the patients will not be on medication.  We need to get away from the notion that the doctor is all about prescribing.  Management of mental health in the modern context is a biopsychosocial model.  It is delivered by a trained multidisciplinary team and, as we discussed earlier, with everybody bringing their own particular skill set and training.  However, to come back to the point about hard cases making bad law and using extreme examples, these are the examples we work with.  These are the people who are going to be affected by this legislation.  The 400 people that I have in my outpatients will, by and large, not be affected by an amended Mental Health Act other than maintaining standards of mental health facilities.  They will never need to be involuntarily admitted, and most of them will never even need to be admitted, full stop.  This legislation pertains to the illest of our patient load and, of the people who attend us, to the ones most in need of care.<\/p><p> The other point is that people will, hopefully, get better.  If they come in as an involuntary patient, we treat their illness, provide them with the requisite medication and all the other appropriate multidisciplinary supports.  The care plan continues into the community and, all going well, they will return to live a life that is functional and meaningful, and is back with their families, loved ones or carers.  The idea of somebody going into hospital for months on end is really not something that generally happens.  On a very rare occasion, one will find somebody with such an intractable illness that they will require long-term hospitalisation.  That is absolutely the exception.  It is important to remember that this legislation relates to the illest and the most vulnerable of individuals.

I hope this helps and makes sense.<\/p> <p>  On the initial question, if I am not mistaken I believe that the Senator is looking for the correct level at which to pitch the admission standard.  We are advocating that the current threshold for admission be retained.  As Dr. Martin said earlier, the vast majority of patients who are admitted under the threshold outlined in the current Act, will lack capacity.

One is that the age changed recently enough, in the greater scheme of things, for CAMHS particularly, from 16 years of age to 18 years.  It was raised.  I do not want to speak for Dr. Whyte but I think most people working in the area would say the resources probably did not reflect the change in work, because as young people get older the complexity of their problems increases.  The most complex cases CAMHS deals with would in the main be the patients aged between 16 and 18 years.  Not always, but the majority would be.<\/p> <p>  Internationally there are a few different models.  In Australia there is the young persons mental health service which covers early adolescence up to those in their early twenties.  That is probably the best model but it is really the CPI that should answer this question because of the different specialty registry.  There is a specialty for children and adolescents and one for adults.  That is the difference.  As social workers, we work generically so the age does not make as much of a difference but for young people attending services the difference has a very real impact for where they are attending.  As I said, the age of 18 years legally has major change.  The age of 16 years has a change but it is where they attend services.  That arbitrary line, depending on how strictly it is enforced, and it is enforced in different places in different ways, can have a big impact on them.  It is an area we need to address.  I defer to my colleagues regarding how the specialties impact on it as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE32022032200002#Z00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Eoin Barry"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1647907200,"counter":559,"content":"<p>It is not a straightforward answer.  Transitions are always difficult.  They are difficult, to various degrees, for everybody.  As my colleague has indicated, Iocally I know from my own experience some services will say a patient is going to be doing his or her leaving certificate in June so we are going to keep her or her on and then once he or she transitions, so there is flexibility.  I suppose it is our own responsibility to engage with the adult services and CAMHS and figure out what is in the best interest, believe it or not, of the patient, what will work for him or her and what will make it easier.<\/p> <p>  Introducing another mid-way service for those aged between 16 and 25 years has merit but also brings its own issues.  Are you going to have two lots of transitions, that is, are you going to transition aged 18 years and then again aged 25 years?  It will depend on your presentation and the cohort.  There are implications for how health services are set up at the moment and how that gets broken down.  What impact does that have on CAMHS?  What age does it start at?  What age does it end at, and all of that.  Again, as somebody has already referenced, CAMHS previously worked up to 16 years and in more recent years has been extended up to 18 years.  From an inpatient unit perspective that works quite well.  CAMHS inpatient units have people aged up to 18 years.  One cannot have an adult in a child unit.  Are inpatient services going to reflect that new proposed form?  As I said, there is no simple answer to it.<\/p><p>As part of the Sharing the Vision working group there are many different people looking at that and many different views but whatever will be patient-centred is what you would hope would come out.  There is the training aspect.  Are the people who work in those services going to be trained in child and in adult services?  Where do those jobs exist?  What do they look like?

However, sometimes it is worth fixing.  Many of the systems and services we have in place at the moment, if they are done properly, actually work really well.  The current model of community mental health teams works really well if adequately resourced with the right people.  One of the big difficulties with the transition from CAMHS to adult is very often it is quite abrupt.  As the Senator mentioned it is an unusual time and could be around the leaving certificate.  However, many CAMHS would be flexible enough, as Dr. Whyte said, to get over that hump but you can ease that transition and we have done it ourselves.  Maybe six months beforehand, let the person know that at age 18 years he or she is going to be moving on to the adult services.  For six months beforehand there is a joint working between the two teams so the person gets to know the personnel on the new team, the new systems, that the clinic might be in a different building and how to make the appointment - all that stuff that comes as a complete culture shock when you go from being completely minded as a child to suddenly being on your own feet as an adult.<\/p> <p>  Also, things change because when you are a child, as it stands, the parents have a huge say.  When you become an adult suddenly aged 18 years, the parents can be excluded if the person has the capacity to exclude them.  Therefore, there are many changes in how services are delivered but if you overlap them properly there is no reason that should not work, and I have seen it work but it takes a will to make it work.  As I said, to change something simply because it is not working without looking at why it is not working can be a mistake.  Much of what we have in theory is very useful and very helpful.  It is a question of getting it adequately resourced and then getting the will to make it work with the people who are involved.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE32022032200002#AA00600","nonspeaker":"Dr. Lorcan Martin"},{"type":"speech","time":1647907200,"counter":566,"content":"<p>That is an interesting point.

It is really important that it is about properly resourcing services but also ensuring posts are filled by adequately-trained personnel.  Dropping somebody in from an agency does not work.  Putting somebody in charge of a system who has no background in the area does not work, so you need to ensure people are adequately trained for the jobs they are doing.  When it comes to doctors, it is really important they are either on the specialist register or ideally somebody who is currently in training.

In the short term, it is more achievable and would bring consistency to the transition, which would be a significant change.  The postcode lottery has a major impact.  The individuals involved take on a lot.  To improve it, there should be a protocol and approach, with this approach being the best.  Regardless of where people live in the country, when they reach a certain age, they should receive services that they need.

There are thousands of admissions every year and restrictive practices are not used that frequently.  As my colleagues pointed out earlier, it is an absolute last resort.  It is strictly controlled by the codes of practice from the Mental Health Commission, to which we all adhere.  We would be found non-compliant if there was as much as one date out of place on the seclusion register.  The standards of governance have improved substantially over the last years.  There are now specific seclusion-related care plans, so it is not simply a question of it being written in a chart or register book.<\/p> <p>  Using seclusion as an example, patients would be in seclusion for the shortest period possible.  They get regular reviews.  If they go in for an hour, a nurse will watch them full-time for an hour and for 15 minutes thereafter.  They have regular medical reviews to make sure that their dignity is maintained in accordance with the codes of practice.  It is often a more humane way of dealing with people who are incredibly distressed and agitated and are putting themselves at risk.  Having a quiet time-out area can be extremely useful.  Seclusion may be more appropriate than restraint for some people.  One example is people who may have been sexually abused, for whom the notion of physical restraint or being held down could be extremely triggering or traumatic.  Using a time-out area, which is locked for their own safety and the safety of others, may be the way to go.<\/p> <p>  The notion of zero restraint and zero seclusion is unrealistic when managing seriously ill patients.  We should aim for the absolute minimum use of seclusion and restraint and every other avenue should be tried before it is used.  All the care plans that we use talk about de-escalation techniques, use of oral medication and so on before one gets to the last resort.

We maintain that staffing levels up to the level provided for in A Vision for Change would be a good starting point, and while we all might have wish lists, it would be an adequate start.  My understanding is that the staffing levels announced in respect of social workers is quite a bit lower than that figure.  Social workers do much of the preventative work, particularly in the case of adults and many of the issues that have been discussed during this meeting, relating to self-care or people not looking after themselves.  Social workers have a very valuable role to play on multidisciplinary teams.  Overall, we suggest that the model in A Vision for Change, and the percentage of funding it recommends go towards mental health, is probably the best basis for recruitment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE32022032200002#DD01300","speaker":"1632","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1647907200,"counter":592,"content":"<p>I might add to a point that was raised by Dr. Martin in response to a question relating to the issue of multidisciplinary teams, which is a very important part of both the current and the envisaged system.  As he pointed out - this follows on from Mr. Barry's point a moment ago - a multidisciplinary team is not just a collection of people from different professions working in the same building.  It is much more than that.<\/p> <p>  Dr. Martin stated that in his view and that of others, the consultant psychiatrist on such a team would be the clinical leader, and I do not have a huge issue with that.  The point I want to make about disciplinary teams is that we tend to be waffly and fudgy about them, and to some extent, we feel that if there is a collection of professionals and a medic among them has been identified as the leader, we will all be grand.  We need to be clear about what the individual roles are, including the role of the clinical lead on the team.  Moreover, the clinical governance of the team is not just about the clinical side of it.  I mentioned the need for appropriate supervision and line management of the various professionals.  Any registered discipline can lead a team, in certain respects such as operationally or in co-ordinating the work, and there have been examples in some areas or fields of practice where that has been the case.  I would argue that can sometimes free up the person who has been otherwise identified as the clinical lead to focus more on his or her specialism.  There is probably a need to explore that issue of the multidisciplinary team or to deal with it to some extent in the legislation.  It is probably an Irish trait to some extent, whereby we feel we are all in the one boat, we are all buddies and so on, but there is a need for clarity.<\/p> <p>  Whether it is the co-ordinator, the operational lead or whoever - along with, clearly, the clinical lead - they need, in all scenarios, to be registered professionals.  As Dr. Martin said, they should be not just a registered professional but someone who has been registered, and has experience, in the appropriate area.  There is a possibility to tease that out further to ensure the multidisciplinary teams we end up with will work at the best capacity and utilise the various skills of the different members and the professions they come from.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE32022032200002#EE00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Vivian Geiran"},{"type":"speech","time":1647907200,"counter":593,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Geiran.

I am accompanied by my colleagues, Mr. Jim Baneham, director of delivery, and Ms Claire Feeney, head of local authority services.<\/p> <p>  The Housing Agency is a State agency with a vision of achieving an integrated housing system, meeting the nation's housing needs and promoting sustainable communities.  We support the delivery of social and affordable homes by working in close collaboration with our main stakeholders, which are the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, local authorities and approved housing bodies.  We do this in three main ways.  First, we co-ordinate the implementation of Government housing programmes.  Second, we build capacity in the housing sector through education and information provision.  Last, we provide high-quality research and data.  The Housing Agency is a resource to the overall housing system, and we have a team of experienced and knowledgeable housing professionals.  In addition to supporting social and affordable housing delivery, which we will discuss here today, we also play a key role in social inclusion, including homelessness and disability.  At the beginning of this month we opened the Housing First national office within the agency.  We also drafted the recently published national housing strategy for disabled people on behalf of the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage.<\/p> <p>  This afternoon I intend to focus on the areas where the Housing Agency is involved in the financing and funding of social and affordable housing.  The agency has different levels of involvement that range between directly providing funding to providing centralised supports for national funding programmes to giving advice and technical support.<\/p> <p>  The agency currently has two direct roles in terms of financing and funding.  First, we provide cost rental equity loans to approved housing bodies to provide cost rental housing.  Second, we manage the Housing Agency's acquisition fund of &euro;70 million to acquire vacant housing stock for social housing use.  Long-term low cost financing is key to delivering cost rental homes with rents of at least 25% below open market rents.  The cost rental equity loans, CREL, is long-term loan funding that is available to approved housing bodies.  This loan funds up to 30% of the cost of delivering new cost rental homes.  The Housing Agency has the role of managing and administering this loan on behalf of the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  I wish to note that for the first time, the Housing Agency is a lender.<\/p> <p>  Bringing vacant properties back into use for social housing purposes is a key Government objective.  The &euro;70 million Housing Agency acquisitions fund was established at the beginning of 2017 to buy existing vacant properties from banks and other financial institutions to provide social housing.  By the end of February 2022, a total of 927 properties had been acquired under the fund.  Housing for All, which is the Government's housing strategy, committed to review the role of the Housing Agency's acquisitions fund and this review is currently under way. <\/p> <p>  I will now discuss the Housing Agency's less direct involvement in funding programmes.  The Housing Agency provides centralised supports for the consistent and efficient delivery of funding programmes.<\/p><p>We carry out the technical assessment of payment and availability, P&amp;A, payments and capital advance leasing facility, CALF, funding applications from approved housing bodies, AHBs, on behalf of the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  As the committee is aware, P&amp;A and CALF funding is the main funding source for AHB housing delivery.  To the end of 2021, just over 11,000 homes have been delivered using this funding mechanism.<\/p><p> A new role for the agency is to provide technical assessment of local authority applications for the affordable housing fund, AHF.  This fund provides local authorities with a subsidy of up to &euro;100,000 towards the cost of a home and is aimed at delivering thousands of homes for affordable purchase and cost rental.  To date, the Housing Agency has completed assessments on eight AHF submissions, totalling approximately 500 homes. <\/p><p> We are responsible for the programme management of the national mortgage-to-rent scheme, MTR, which is designed to help homeowners at risk of losing their homes due to mortgage arrears to remain living in their homes as social housing tenants.  By the end of February 2022, some 1,727 households had been supported to remain in their homes. <\/p><p> We also provide local authorities with a national shared service for the underwriting of local authority home loan applications.  This type of loan enables first-time buyers and fresh starters on low to moderate incomes to access sustainable, competitive mortgages to buy new or second-hand homes or self-builds.  We have underwritten 179 local authority home loans to the end of February 2022.  Under the previous Rebuilding Ireland home loan scheme, 11,259 loans were underwritten.  <\/p><p> We also provide advice and technical support in respect of funding schemes.  We are advising the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage on the design and operation of the first home affordable purchase shared equity scheme.  We also play a role in long-term social housing leasing.  We oversee the template leases, including the repair and leasing scheme.  Additionally, we support the capital assistance scheme, CAS, and local authority direct-build capital projects.  The agency has a hands-on technical team, called the projects and procurement team, that provides technical support to local authorities and AHBs in the procurement, design and delivery of social housing projects.  We also provide guidance and assistance, including template documentation, to support local authorities with compulsory purchase orders, CPOs.  The Housing Agency has established a team to assist local authorities with information gathering, title searches and investigating third-party charges that arise with CPOs.<\/p><p> The members of the committee will see that the Housing Agency has a wide role in supporting the financing and funding of housing programmes.  We recently published our three-year statement of strategy and a key priority is continuing to work with our stakeholders to deliver more affordable and social housing in the years to come.  We are happy to answer any questions members may have or to provide further details as required. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022032200002#A00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Bob Jordan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1647907200,"counter":603,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Jordan.

The committee already has it, so reading it word for word might not improve our lives.  I thank the committee for the invitation.  I am accompanied by my colleagues, Mr. Se&aacute;n Cremen and Mr. Tom Conroy.  The HFA's mission is to facilitate the successful delivery of social and affordable housing in Ireland.  We do this by providing long-term competitive finance to the sector to support the schemes introduced by the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  We were initially established in 1982 to provide housing finance to local authorities.  Our remit has expanded since then to include lending to AHBs for social and affordable housing.  Since 2019, we have also been lending to higher education institutions, HEIs, for the development of student accommodation.<\/p> <p>  Our outstanding loan book, as of 31 December 2021, was &euro;5.9 billion.  We are a self-financing organisation and we do not receive any subvention from the Exchequer.  The board of the HFA is appointed by the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, with the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  It normally consists of 12 members, including a serving local authority chief executive, and representatives of the private and public sectors.  <\/p> <p>  Turning to our lending, most of our loan book consists of lending to local authorities.  Some &euro;3.33 billion of our total of &euro;5.9 billion in lending is to local authorities, while &euro;2.42 billion is lent to approved housing bodies.  That is a representation of the fact that we have spent most of our 40 years of existence lending to local authorities.  The new strategy we brought out this year, Strategy HFA 2026, forecasts that we will lend a further &euro;1.45 billion to local authorities over the next five years.  It will be to fund things like the local authority home loans scheme and the retrofitting scheme for the housing stock of local authorities and AHBs.  <\/p> <p>  We began our lending to approved housing bodies in 2012.  Until then, the Government largely grant-funded housing bodies for social housing through local authorities.  However, budgetary constraints then led to the introduction of loan finance, which is supported by the Government's capital advanced leasing scheme, CALF.  The HFA has since adapted its own processes to quickly become the largest provider of loan finance for the sector.  To date, the HFA has approved 19 AHBs for certified body status, which is the status we confer on them when we are prepared to lend to them.  Over the past five years, we have approved lending of &euro;3.6 billion, which will allow for the provision of 17,350 homes.  <\/p> <p>  The drawing down of funds obviously lags the approval of loans.  Typically, depending on whether loans are for the purchase of turnkey properties or for building and construction, the time between approval and drawdown can range anywhere between 12 and 30 months, but it stretched a bit during the pandemic.  Moving to advances, we have advanced &euro;2.3 billion to approved housing bodies in the past five years and that covers the provision of about 10,000 homes.  Therefore, we have a situation where loan advances are being made after the approvals, but we have a strong pipeline of approvals, which means we are happy that a lot of activity is going to happen in the next two years. <\/p> <p>  On cost rental, that scheme was launched by the Department in early 2021 and there have since been two calls for proposals from AHBs.  The HFA was happy to fund applications for these.  In 2021, we approved &euro;93 million for cost rental homes, which will see the delivery of 390 homes this year.  Since the beginning of this year, we have approved a further nine applications amounting to &euro;108 million, which will deliver 454 homes.  All applications are for turnkey units and the expected delivery is quite quick.  It will be at the lower end of the range I spoke of.  The HFA has an appetite to provide more finance for cost rental schemes.  Our Strategy HFA 2026 estimates about &euro;850 million in funding, so we will be keen to support this area.  It is clearly something for which there is good demand.  It is delivering rents at a reduced rate compared with the market and we are keen to support it.  <\/p> <p>  Regarding lending to higher education institutions, this began for us quite recently.  The HFA has been enabled to lend to HEIs at low-cost, long-term fixed rates.  The idea is that the provision of student accommodation will free up housing in the wider market, and we are happy to support that endeavour.  We have thus far lent &euro;168 million to three universities for the provision of just under 1,500 student bedrooms, and we anticipate several applications this year for this funding.  <\/p> <p>  Turning to our borrowing, we are now authorised to borrow up to &euro;10 billion.  We borrow this money through a guaranteed notes programme from the National Treasury Management Agency, NTMA, and from local authorities.  We also borrow money from the European Investment Bank, EIB, and the Council of Europe Development Bank, CEB.  The Housing for All strategy introduced by the Government last year allows for the possibility of expanding our borrowing limit to &euro;12 billion, and that would certainly cover the anticipated lending we expect to undertake during our five-year strategy.<\/p><p>In the course of the past year we have signed a number of finance deals with the European Investment Bank and the Council of Europe Development Bank.  Just today, we signed a document with the Council of Europe Development Bank for &euro;75 million in a facility that will support the development of student accommodation by the higher education institutions.<\/p><p> On our financial results and prospects for the future, our 2021 accounts are being audited now and we expect to have them cleared and approved by our board on Thursday week.  It will be just by the end of March we will have those approved.  Those accounts will indicate what we consider an excellent year in 2021.  We have loans advanced of &euro;934 million, up 21% on the previous year.  The previous year was at a record level.  Loan approvals were strong and we see a good pipeline for the prospects into 2022 and 2023, so we are quite happy with that.<\/p><p> In Strategy HFA 2026, we forecast that we will double our loan book by the end of those five years so we will have moved on to approximately &euro;12 billion.  We expect that in the course of those five years we will have funded housing that will deliver 19,000 new homes and 3,300 student beds.  This basically represents 25% of the entire expenditure that will be made under the Housing for All programme.  We are keen to stress that this is the least we expect to do and the HFA certainly anticipates that if more is required of us, we would be capable of delivering more and we would be quite happy that we would have access to the funding for that.<\/p><p> There is a table within the submission to the committee indicating where we see the lending occurring in the next five years, broken down between approved housing bodies, local authorities and higher education institutions.  We welcome the opportunity to have this discussion today and we look forward to the committee's questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022032200002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Barry O'Leary","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1647907200,"counter":606,"content":"<p>We received a copy of the strategy with the agency's submission.

As Mr. O'Leary has said, we are working hand in glove with the HFA, and the reason we have become a secondary lender is to really ensure the availability of low-cost long-term finance to deliver the cost-rental sector.  We are also working hand in glove with the Land Development Agency.  In some cases lands that have been held by the Housing Agency are being developed by the Land Development Agency to deliver social, affordable and cost rental housing.<\/p> <p>  We need to continue to communicate with people.  The committee will know from my opening statement that we are involved in quite a wide range of matters.  It is really important for us to get out and communicate them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022032200002#C00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Bob Jordan"},{"type":"speech","time":1647907200,"counter":612,"content":"<p>There is still an issue at local authority level.

Everybody in the committee acknowledges that work and wishes them well in their endeavours.<\/p><p>I have a few questions for Mr. Jordan and then a few for Mr. O'Leary.  Concerning the &euro;70 million rolling fund, the original target under the previous Government's plan was 1,600 units to be brought on stream by 2021.  As Mr. Jordan said, only 927 were achieved.  In the review, is there anything Mr. Jordan can say about what learning might be there at this stage to ensure that fund continues to make sure, whatever targets are set, that it can increase the acquisitions?  On cost rental, many of us are still concerned about entry-level rents.  The price of construction is the price of construction but the entry-level rents can be brought down and were brought down on Enniskerry Road by extending the term of the loan.  Is the Housing Agency looking at making longer term finance, whether through the EIB and the HFA or a mixture, over, say, a 40-year rather than 25-year period to get entry-level rents below &euro;1,000 or &euro;900?  That is important in terms of affordability.<\/p><p>Does the Housing Agency have any concerns and is it doing any research in relation to the impact of rising construction costs?  When construction goes up, it affects the entry-level rents.  I am unsure what the repayment arrangements will be for the local authority equity portion under the housing fund.  Can Mr. Jordan offer any clarity on that?<\/p><p>For Mr. O'Leary, there was coverage in today's <i>Irish Examiner <\/i>of the drawdown delays.  We all understand that projects take different amounts of time and can be long or short.  Has Mr. O'Leary observed whether it is particular types of projects that are drawing down longer?  Is it CALF rather than turnkey?  Is it direct build?  Is it a mixture?  <\/p><p>On mixed tenure, many of us would like to see local authorities and approved housing bodies do a mix of social rental and affordable rental.  Does having a CREL and a CALF complicate that from Mr. O'Leary's end or would he be able to easily combine a HFA loan with an AHB that is bringing CALF and CREL to the table?  Does he have any observations on loan length, in terms of bringing entry-level rents down?  That issue is important to us.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022032200002#D00300","speaker":"1468"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1647907200,"counter":621,"content":"<p>I will take the first two questions on the &euro;70 million fund and cost rental and then hand over to Mr. Baneham.  The Deputy is correct on the &euro;70 million fund.  It was meant to turn over four times but turned over two and a half times.  There are a couple of reasons for that.  One is that the properties that were available dried up and it took longer to revolve the properties and sell them on to AHBs.<\/p> <p>  In terms of learning, there is a big focus on vacancy in Housing for All.

For cost rental, there is a direct relationship between the rent charged and the cost of delivery.  The first two CRELs have been time-focused, as Mr. Jordan said.  As a result of that, they have been focused on turnkey.  With the open call, there is an aspiration to broaden that and deliver schemes where there is more control over costs.

As other speakers said, the role they play in the provision of social and affordable housing is critical and will become even more so in the years ahead.<\/p> <p>  On the topic of cost rental, one of the debates that happened when the legislation was going through the Houses was in relation to moving beyond.  At the moment, Government is proving that the concept works and says the AHB is the appropriate sector to prove concept.  However, the legislation allows for going beyond the AHB sector and for low cost return funds, such as pension funds, to get involved, as is normal across Europe in the provision of such a model.  What are the agencies' views on that?  What changes may be required to facilitate that beyond the AHB sector?  In order for us to get the scale required in cost rental, it will have to go beyond that sector.  Only through scale and time will we see the benefit of it and the competition with the private rental market which will bring down rents.  I just looked at the figures there.<\/p><p>It was stated that &euro;850 million was ring-fenced for cost-rental finance out to 2026.  If we do a rough calculation on the figures, the Housing Finance Agency is lending between approximately &euro;237,000 and &euro;238,000 per home, which is for roughly 3,600 cost-rental properties it has earmarked up to 2026.  We know we need to go beyond that.  It was mentioned that the Housing Finance Agency's envelope will allow it to do so.  What needs to be done in order to move?

I will circle in on Housing for All and I will look at all the different agencies that have been mentioned.  If we focus on the LDA, the LDA does nothing for me in the area I represent because all its funding is based in the cities.  The funding is not based in the county because of infrastructural issues we have in Limerick.  When I look at funding and Housing for All, it does not cover housing for all in the county area I live in.  The LDA will support something within 15 minutes of the city but, geographically, Limerick city is in a corner and the county unfolds from it.  You could be looking at 40-odd miles by the time you get to Ballylanders and another 40-odd miles by the time you get to Abbeyfeale, for which the funding is very weak due to a lack of infrastructure.<\/p> <p>  The repair and leasing scheme could help but, again, it is based on existing infrastructure.  Even though it is at its maximum capacity, it will at least help.  From the perspective of new builds and funding, how much of the agencies' funding has gone to areas outside the cities for housing?  In Limerick it cannot go to such areas because of the lack of infrastructure.  How do I have Housing for All in Limerick?  I welcome the money that is being spent in the city.  It is welcome and we have to house people, but I also want to welcome how to make my towns and villages sustainable and put people into houses there.<\/p> <p>  I come from the construction sector and have been in construction all my life.  When the representatives talked about the loans they will be giving out, I cannot understand how they can justify those loans in the context of inflation.  The price of housing has gone up by approximately &euro;70-odd per square foot in an 18-month period.  I know this basis because I deal with construction on a daily basis.  I find it hard in construction when something could be priced today but tomorrow it is different, including labour content and material content.  Everything is moving at a fast pace.  For the agencies own security and funding, if they are lending &euro;150 million to a project and that sum turns into &euro;250 million, how will they counteract that to make sure these projects last?  We saw this week that Roadbridge went into receivership.  This is a perfect example when we consider how to future-proof.<\/p> <p>  The biggest question I have relates to the representatives who mentioned they have so many teams.  How many of their teams can help me rebuild County Limerick in respect of the lack of infrastructure we have traditionally had from generations of Government and the failure of local authorities to invest in and improve infrastructure, sewerage and water, so I can rebuild towns and villages?  If I rebuild towns and villages to a larger scale, I can then make a case for proper transport infrastructure from hubs in towns, which could bring in the villages around them.

I acknowledge the work they do for the State on public housing.  I have three questions.  I may start by confusing myself on the first one but it relates to the fact they have informed us of the type and level of funding available to local authorities from the Housing Finance Agency, HFA.  Can local authorities avail of a better rate than the AHBs and, if so, does the agency envisage local authorities driving the delivery of cost rental and affordable housing, considering the capital available and the understanding of the local authority needs and demands?  I look at the agency's chart and it shows the agency is providing three times the amount of funding to AHBs and local authorities but there may be other funding mechanisms within all that.  The question is, and I have two more, whether there is a different rate of interest on the money.<\/p> <p>  Very quickly, the second question is whether the agencies have received the local authorities' housing delivery action plans.  Third, the targets are ambitious and we all know that, but will our guests speak of the challenges we have with the delivery?

Certainly with our strategy, which is a quarter of the overall Housing for All strategy, we are confident we will hit the numbers we forecast for this year.<\/p> <p>  Starting at the beginning, \"Yes\" is the answer to whether there is a rate difference.  It is about the risk of lending to a local authority and the chance of it going bust versus that of an AHB, although they are very good businesses.  The rate differential is about 0.75%.  It makes a difference when you are rolling into the model in terms of what you could deliver cost rental for.<\/p> <p>  Do we see local authorities being involved?  We would love to see them being involved and drawing down money for cost rental because it would spread our portfolio.  We would be lending to two different types of business then.

Perhaps we could follow up on that.  Has the Department of Justice approached the Housing Agency?  Has there been any backward planning done on how a large number of people can be housed within such a short period?<\/p> <p>  There were 390 cost-rental properties funded in 2021.  We know from replies to parliamentary questions tabled by Deputies &Oacute; Broin and O'Callaghan that only 115 were delivered by the end of last year.  Some 454 are due to be funded in 2022.  That is approaching 1,000 homes over two years.  The Government commitment in the Housing for All plan is low at only 2,000 properties per year, which would total 18,000.  If we are only managing to fund 1,000 properties over two years, not all of which are being delivered, are our guests confident that we will be able to deliver at least 18,000 by 2030?  I understand there is funding but are our they confident in delivering those cost rentals?<\/p> <p>  A 40-year lending period has been mentioned.  One of the mistakes we in Ireland have made with regard to housing and our investment in social housing is that we sell off stock and do not replace it.  Since 2012, the only funding available was going to local authorities and now 45% of funding is going to AHBs.  Once that 40-year period is up, are AHBs required to keep the property as social and affordable housing?  If so, what happens at the end of that period?<\/p><p>Can they then just switch off to market?  Can they then sell on their portfolio?  Is anything built into the leases when it comes to approved housing bodies?<\/p><p> There is provision in the Affordable Housing Act for cost rental associations of limited-profit associations.  I am not entirely mad about them but they are there.  Will a clause be built into them?  Will the Housing Agency have a role in funding those limited-profit associations?  If so, what would constitute that limited profit?  Does the same 40-year period apply?  Will they then be able to revert to market after that 40-year period?  <\/p><p> The Housing Finance Agency has funded co-operative housing through approved housing bodies.  Has any work been done on  funding of co-operative housing?  One co-operative housing project for eight people fell apart in D&uacute;n Laoghaire recently thanks to a contractor.  I think it is an interesting concept.<\/p><p> The Housing for All commitments include a new programme to introduce CPOs to allow the resale of vacant properties on the open market.  It was due to be completed by the end of 2021.  There is a target of 2,500 in the next two and a half years.  What steps have both agencies taken to facilitate this?  When do they foresee that this new CPO programme being implemented?

To be clear, we will meet AHBs on a monthly basis to make sure those delivery dates are met.

Another instance of control for longer-term use of housing is Enniskerry Road.  That was our land at the outset.  We entered into a 150-year lease on that land before we transferred across.  The leases are with the two AHBs.  That controlled the use of those lands for social and affordable for the period of that lease.  There are probably a number of control measures that can be used depending on who is delivering it and what land is going to be built on.  With local authority land, local authorities can have more control of delivering its long-term use themselves.

That would be a different situation to the limited-profit organisations to which the Senator referred.

It depends on whether it was ever allowed by the Government - we would look at it if it did - but we have no plans in that area.

Earlier, Mr. Jordan said he is involved in an advisory capacity in the shared equity scheme.  I would be interested to hear his perspective on that.  What does that advisory role look like?<\/p> <p>  Mr. O'Leary summed up well that his agency provides cheap, long-term financing that delivers homes.  That is so desperately needed in this country now.  Its lending rate and turnaround times in decision-making and the approval rates seem most impressive.  They are having a direct impact on housing on the ground.  We can that.  My first question relates to forecasted funds for 2022.  Is there a breakdown available of the mix of social versus affordable in that forecast?  My second question relates to sites where construction was under way but has ground to a halt.  The price of raw material has increased in recent months.  Contractors who have started projects have said that the financing agreed no longer works for them.  There have been negotiations on sites up and down the country and I refer in particular to my county council area.  In such a situation, has a local authority the option to go back and renegotiate its loans with the Housing Finance Agency because a project is running over because of unforeseen or unbudgeted-for circumstances?  We want to make sure that houses are delivered as cheaply as possible but also as quickly as possible.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022032200002#H00600","speaker":"1566"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1647907200,"counter":700,"content":"<p>We would expect to lend something like &euro;1.2 billion next year.

I would say that 90% or more of what we lend will be for social housing.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy asked about sites where construction has ground to a halt and cost increases.<\/p><p>That is an ongoing issue but probably more so because our business is lending to approved housing bodies more so now than to local authorities.

If the cash flows support it, we will lend more and we have been lending more during the past 12 months for those sorts of loans.

I fully understand the entry level rent is a policy matter for Government.  It is not a matter for the lender.  My question is similar to Deputy Cian O'Callaghan's but presented in a different way.  If Government made a policy decision to reduce those entry-level rents to cover people who we want to be able to afford cost-rental but who currently cannot and if Government were to ask the HFA what could be done at the finance end, would it be possible, for example, to stretch some of those finance arrangements to 50 years or 60 years as they exist in other jurisdictions?  What would the interest rate implications after year 40 be?  Is that something that could be done from Mr. O'Leary's knowledge of loan finance?<\/p> <p>  St. Michael's Estate, which will be the first local authority-led cost-rental scheme, does not have 40-year finance - unless Mr. O'Leary can break some good news to us today.  The European Investment Bank loan which it originally got under the last Government is over 25 or 30 years.  Dublin City Council has advised its elected members that that means the entry-level rents to that development will be &euro;1,300 per month.  Obviously, if Dublin City Council were to seek the assistance of the HFA, could that finance be restructured as was done on Enniskerry Road to provide 40-year finance to assist in that?  <\/p> <p>  I did not know that the HFA could lend to the local authorities at a lower interest rate; that is very interesting.  Based on that 0.75%, by how much would that reduce the monthly loan repayment for a standard unit of accommodation that the agency funds?  I am asking this for an important reason.  Local authorities are not engaging in cost rental because it is not really Government policy.  They really want the AHBs and the LDA to be involved in that.  The local authorities are giving up the possibility of doing cost rental, as with St. Teresa's Gardens, to the LDA.  However, if the local authorities could borrow at a lower interest rate than the AHBs and the LDA, that would obviously be a very positive step to reducing the rent.  I would be very interested to hear anything Mr. O'Leary has to add to that.

If we then needed to make assumptions that it will be variable from year 40 to year 50 or year 50 to year 60, we would run the risk that the assumptions we might make about variable rates could make the thing reverse.

I will now proceed to my monologue.  Like Deputy O'Donoghue, I hope the delegates can give me some comfort with their responses.  I hope that whoever is answering my next question has a mother or mother-in-law from Longford.  Probably only 11 counties are being actively encouraged to come forward with an affordable housing scheme.  In Longford, we have not built a three-bedroom semi-detached house in 12 years.  This is the starter home in the housing market &mdash; an entry-level house.  All the reasons are known.  It was too expensive to build such a house and much cheaper to buy a second-hand house.  Effectively, in a large swathe of rural Ireland we have a non-functioning housing market.  Covid has shown that people are quite happy to live in rural Ireland and want to return to living there.  Most companies are quite happy for people to live there.  If we are serious about tackling the housing crisis, it makes perfect sense to enable people, within reason, to live in rural Ireland.  Having said all that, I contend it is increasingly difficult, if not nigh impossible, for the county councils and other local authorities to get approval through the Department.  Given the affordable housing structure required in local authorities' proposals, the answers the Department wants simply cannot be supplied.  Despite this, I can state anecdotally that if we had an affordable housing scheme in Longford tomorrow morning, there would certainly be more than 200 applicants, most of whom would qualify for the local authority housing loan, which the delegates' good office would be financing.<\/p> <p>  We are building up to what will probably be a perfect storm regarding housing in rural Ireland.  In the year to date regarding leases, including rental accommodation scheme leases, in Longford, 22 landlords have issued a notice to exit the market.  The houses will be snapped up and we will have more people coming to the local authority.  Obviously, the delegates hear about this from other local authorities, not just Longford County Council.  Is there an appetite at the level of the representatives, given that they are in partnership with the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, to tell the Department that we need to be more proactive regarding affordable housing, make things easier and actively encourage every local authority to produce an affordable housing scheme?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022032200002#K01400","speaker":"1597"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1647907200,"counter":732,"content":"<p>The Department sets the policy on the local authority affordable purchase scheme.

We have done a little bit of that through the &euro;70 million fund and bought some older town centre properties.  It requires considerable resources depending on the property.

The amount of time resources that go into doing a proper job is disproportionate when one only considers the numbers.  That is probably a little bit of a disincentive to local authorities which might have limited staff resources.  The time required for a scheme to get a row of, say, three or four houses in Birr back into use could be similar, timewise, to that needed to deliver a brand new scheme of 50 houses down the road.  Such work takes time.  In terms of the overall output, it is not only about the number of houses but also the changes made to the town.

I do not say this lightly but we are very fortunate to have them.  Their expertise and focus are clear.  I thank them for submitting their opening statements, which were most helpful.  I acknowledge their technical and other expertise.  They do not set the policy and perhaps that is just as well.  There is a differentiation to be made between policymakers and those who ultimately implement policy.  I liked the expression Mr. O&rsquo;Leary used when speaking about student accommodation that the Housing Agency is just the lender and does not police the scheme.  That is a very simple matter-of-fact statement.  Perhaps I am picking up that that is the type of person he is and it reflects his personality but he is very clear and concise and I compliment him on that.  Sometimes we need less jargon and to have people just get to the point.  The witnesses are focused on the task in hand and we are very fortunate to have that.  This is about Housing for All and rolling out the various options.  There are layers of different options and no single option that fits everything.  I wanted to acknowledge that.<\/p> <p>  I am directing this comment to Mr. O'Leary.  There are 31 local authorities.  Local authorities account for 56% of the outstanding loan book of the Housing Finance Agency.  Would it be possible, and it may not be, for Mr. O'Leary to share a breakdown of that loan book across the relevant local authorities?  This committee is always looking at data and trying to narrow its focus.  Without playing the blame game, some local authorities perform far better than others.  There are many reasons for that and I am not making a criticism.<\/p><p>What is becoming clear after many years sitting on this committee is, perhaps, a lack of technical and financial expertise in local authorities, and that is where the groups before us come in.  I am interested in hearing more about that.<\/p><p> There is the lending to higher education institutions, and three of those have been mentioned.  Will the witnesses speak about those?  Are they confident that others will come on stream?  The reality is that if accommodation used by students can be freed in particular centres, with the students moving to or near educational campuses, there will be a shift that would create vacancies in other existing accommodation.  It is an important aspect and the witnesses might speak to us about it.<\/p><p> There is also the question of the Land Development Agency, which is the big game in town.  It has a big vision and plans, and there was some resistance to it.  I had some concerns about how it interfaced with local authorities and the disposal of local authority properties.  The legislation has moved on and the process is on a more definite footing.  The Land Development Agency will have powers to acquire properties in local authorities, as is correct.  What is the engagement with the Land Development Agency like?<\/p><p> Mr. Jordan's agency has really driven home the technical supports element.  I do not want to be critical of local authorities but we are clearly seeing less involvement in local authorities.  There is a desire on the part of the Government to continue supporting them.  At the end of the day, however, it is not about supporting local authorities but people who can deliver homes, no matter who provides them or from where the finance is coming.  Let us not get caught up in the ideology; we want homes for all people.<\/p><p> I will speak to the CPO process.  I am familiar with it because I was on a council for many years before coming here.  I live in D&uacute;n Laoghaire.  I could bring the delegations to 35 derelict properties all in the hands and full unencumbered ownership of the local authority.  There would be no difficulty with them.  We have a crisis in D&uacute;n Laoghaire; we have a housing crisis everywhere.  In many cases the local authorities have very valuable assets in major town centre zones.  They could have commercial, retail and residential properties of which they do not take advantage.<\/p><p> On the advisory aspect, local authorities will constantly say a CPO is a financial quagmire.  There are two aspects in that way so will Mr. Jordan speak to that?  Are local authorities receptive or could Mr. Jordan say how engaging or receptive are local authorities in the process?  The Housing Agency is to make land available to the Land Development Agency so will Mr. Jordan flag where they are and how that process is progressing?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022032200002#L01900","speaker":"1634","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1647907200,"counter":762,"content":"<p>Senator John Cummins took the Chair.<\/p>"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1647907200,"counter":763,"content":"<p>Ms Feeney will speak to the CPO process.

These would be local authorities with build targets up to approximately 1,000 units, and there are approximately 15 local authorities in that space.<\/p> <p>  With regard to approved housing bodies, it is important to note that 45% of the overall social housing target will be delivered by approved housing bodies.

In developing such a project, the end result must be that it leads to a direct sales purchase to the homeowner.  The reason for that is laudable because the person involved has to be able to avail of the help-to-buy scheme, which is worth &euro;30,000, and that will very much assist them.  However, the difficulty is that the developer who is developing the affordable purchase unit for the State and for the ultimate purchaser is probably, at best, getting lending at 10%, with 1% in and 1% out.

I will not ask the witnesses to comment on such a policy matter.  I want to make a general comment about rent setting and then I have a number of questions which we might go through one by one since we have all the time in the world.<\/p> <p>  I want to pick which Mr. O'Leary up on one matter.  He used the phrase \"nirvana of lower rents\".  I want to explain why the rent setting is so important, not just for the tenant but also for the HFA in terms of its management of loans and for Mr. Jordan as well in the Housing Agency.  The problem is a lot of our conversation on this is not a criticism of either of the organisations in front of us today.  The conversations about cost-rental have started with the very odd idea that you take market rent and you apply a discount.  That is not cost-rental.  It is a particularly Irish way of approaching the issue.  Cost-rental is exactly as Mr. O'Leary has outlined from the very start.  It is the very boring process of the thing has to pay for itself and that does not have any relationship to the market rent in the private rental sector.  We have two if not three possible dangers in the way in which this scheme has been set up that I want to put on the record.  The first is there is a whole cohort of people for whom cost rental is meant to be viable, for whom it currently is not.  They are either single people, single income households or very low-income households just above the threshold for social housing.  At &euro;1,200 or &euro;1,300 a month, they would be paying up to 50% of their net disposable income on rent.  That is not my opinion; it is the result of a very detailed analysis given to its elected members by Dublin City Council on the basis of a number of cost-rental projects.<\/p> <p>  Cost-rental cannot be affordable if it is 40% to 50% of people's net disposable income.  I completely understand that is not Mr. O'Leary&rsquo;s primary policy concern.  The problem is, however, that just as the old shared ownership schemes at the latter end of the Celtic tiger era were very risky for the lower-income households that bought into them - there was four times more mortgage default on those than on mainstream mortgages - we have a parallel risk here with cost-rental.  If we set the rents too high and if we allow modest income households into those tenancies, if and when there is another recession, we know that those workers are more likely to lose their jobs first and that is going to cause a problem for the landlords of those cost-rental facilities and the issuers of the debt.<\/p><p>In the first instance, the conversation about bringing the rents down to a more affordable rent level for one of the core target groups is key to the viability of the scheme.  I am appealing to the Housing Agency to understand when some of us in this room call for the reduction of rents, it is not because we want to be popular with the people who live in those.  It is because we want cost rental to grow, as well as to be large and sustainable over the long term.  If we accept - and I do not accept this - that entry-level rents are &euro;1,200, &euro;1,300 or &euro;1,400, in the case of Oscar Traynor Road or O'Devaney Gardens, it will be even higher on the basis of current cost configuration, then we have a problem.  I want to emphasise that first.  <\/p><p> Second, we have another danger.  If we look at the first round of the cost rental equity loans, CREL, out in the suburbs where I am, the gap between the CREL rents and the market rent is dangerously close.  While it is within the 25% threshold, there will be a cost rental equity loan out in Citywest, for example, of &euro;1,200.  Out there, some market rents are &euro;1,600, &euro;1,700 or &euro;1,800.  We know how volatile our private rental sector is.  We saw what happened to rents after 2010.<\/p><p> There is a genuine concern among many, and the Housing Agency will know this because this has been said to them in other quarters, that if the private rental sector takes a nosedive over the next ten years, we could have the bizarre situation where cost rents become more expensive than market rents.  Let us not forget, and the Housing Finance Agency appreciates this more than most, what happened with the unsold affordables, which were 2,000 units at the end of the crash.  The local authorities were tied into their cost.  We still have not resolved that problem.  Nobody knows how we are going to fix it.  Therefore, if we are simply pegging the target rent at 25% of the market rate, that will create a danger if there is a downturn in the private rental sector.  <\/p><p> My third point goes back to Deputy Flaherty's question about affordability in rural areas.  The idea that we would peg affordability to 25% of market rent in areas where market rents are low - they still might be unaffordable - will cause a problem in the rural areas.  I am not looking for a response to that.  I am just appealing to the witnesses&rsquo; good offices to take the issue that the entry-level rents are important.  I am not naive enough to think that this is all about the interest rates or that it is easily solved.  Yet, I am worried that if we just blindly accept the entry-level rents as they are currently being proposed, we could end up having problems in five or ten years.  They, like the old shared-ownership schemes or the unsold affordables, could come back to haunt us.  That is why I am making an appeal.  I made it to the new chair of the LDA and I make it to the Minister at every opportunity.  I still think that there is a bit of work to be done to bring down those entry-level rents.  I am encouraged by some of what Mr. Jordan said earlier.  They have to be brought down below &euro;1,000, particularly for single people, for the single-income households and those who are two deciles above the entry level for social housing eligibility.  If they are not, we will be designing in a problem at the start.<\/p><p> I want to pick up on the Acting Chair&rsquo;s question about the circular with respect to the drawdown of the Rebuilding Ireland home loan, as it was back in June or July 2020.  It stipulated that one had to have exited the employment wage subsidy scheme, EWSS, for at least three months, but there was some flexibility on the parts of the local authority and the Housing Agency.  Maybe a simpler way to answer the question is that no new circular has been issued since then, is that not correct?  It is still that circular. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022032200002#N01500","speaker":"1468","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1647907200,"counter":792,"content":"<p>I think so, but again I want to go back to confirm.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022032200002#O00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jim Baneham"},{"type":"speech","time":1647907200,"counter":793,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022032200002#O00300","speaker":"1468"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1647907200,"counter":794,"content":"<p>I did not do my cribbing on that particular question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022032200002#O00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jim Baneham"},{"type":"speech","time":1647907200,"counter":795,"content":"<p>The straight answer to the Acting Chair's question as I understand it is that circular has not been updated.

The Minister has communicated the change clearly, that both contributory and non-contributory pensions are now to be regarded as income, rather than as social welfare, for the purposes of potential eligibility for tenant purchase.  As well as this, the threshold has been reduced.  What is not clear, however, is that there is another other rule that 50% of a person's income must come from earnings, but they cannot make cash payment.  They still have to have a mortgage finance of more than 90%.  The wording that the Minister is using to clarify the position <i>vis-&agrave;-vis<\/i>pensioners is something like, &ldquo;where they have the means to do so&rdquo;.  Does that refer to where they have access to mortgage finance?  Has the Government taken a decision, or is the Housing Agency aware of a decision by the Government, to allow cash purchases for pensioners?  If they are not allowing that, then it neither matters that a pension is treated as income, nor that it is &euro;13,000.  A person is not going to get a mortgage at the age of 65 or 70.

There is ongoing engagement with them to say that we think they need to strengthen in this area or that.  They have done so, and a number have reached that threshold but we are very cautious.

At the tail end of Mr. O'Leary's contribution, he talked about low or no-interest loans up to five years to local authorities from vacant properties.  I may not have heard him properly.  Will he cast his mind back to that?<\/p> <p>  The second point is a more general observation.  Again, it is not necessary with regard to whether HFA does or does not loan but, because it is involved in lending for residential property, would Mr. O'Leary have any observations in terms of construction inflation?  What is his general read of where he thinks the construction industry market is currently at?  Everybody on the committee is keen to canvas as many views on where people think that is likely to go in the near future as it affects the plans before us.<\/p> <p>  I refer to Mr. Jordan as to turnkey competitions.  Traditionally, it was just the local authorities and the AHBs that did turnkey properties for social housing.  We know that it accounts for approximately half of new social housing.  We now have AHBs looking for turnkeys with CREL.  The LDA's Project Tosaigh is doing turn-keys.  The Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe cities scheme includes turnkeys.  Will Mr. Jordan provide more information than what we have to date about how it will be co-ordinated between multiple public actors?<\/p><p>If I was a developer with a site on Fenian Street and with planning permission for 100 units I would know a long queue of people who would be happy to buy those, both in the public and private sectors.  How can we make sure that increased competition, and all of those public sector actors, including the Housing Agency, which are desperate to meet their targets, do not end up unintentionally inflating prices or increasing costs to the State as a result of that?<\/p><p> I refer to the review that was done on the social housing thresholds and how that limit interacts with the cost rental rents.  The Minister has told us on a number of occasions that the Housing Agency was involved in that review.  I know the witnesses cannot tell us the outcome of the review because it is with the Minister etc.  However, is there anything they can say to the committee about where that social housing threshold eligibility is?  They might not be able; they might be constrained by the fact that it is with the Minister but we are all keen to hear where that lands.<\/p><p> I have a lot of sympathy with the Acting Chairman's queries around the caps.  I am more interested in the council loans; I am still not a convert to the shared equity loan but the point is the same on both sides and it affects all areas.  I take the point that the level of house price inflation outside of Dublin and the greater Dublin area is greatest.  However, do we also run the risk that if we chase that house price inflation, we could contribute to further inflation?  This might be a question for Mr. Baneham.  I am not arguing against the Acting Chairman because there is no point in having a council loan where there are virtually no properties available.  If one looks at the Rebuilding Ireland home loan in Dublin, for example, particularly in Dublin city, the average loan offering over the last four or five years was about &euro;200,000.  One would not buy any kind of home in Dublin city, not even a three-bedroom, two-bedroom or one-bedroom home, for anything below &euro;300,000 and now it is anything below &euro;350,000 to &euro;370,000.

The intention is that other actors will have more affordable homes available at that point in time.  It should not be something that just keeps going, which is another control on its inflationary effects.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022032200002#Q00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jim Baneham"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1647907200,"counter":843,"content":"<p>On the two to five-year short-term loan that we propose for derelict or CPO buildings, we would be quite happy to lend to a local authority at a rate somewhere between nothing and 0.5% for a short-term loan for two years but certainly not for more than five years.

The meeting today is the second part of a two-part engagement on the general scheme of the gambling regulation Bill.  We have a number of witnesses to share their wisdom and expertise with us.  The witnesses are appearing virtually.

For the benefit of witnesses, they are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Witnesses attending remotely from outside Leinster House should note that, because we are still in a somewhat unusual situation, there may be some limitations on parliamentary privilege.  They may not enjoy the same full degree of immunity as they would if they were present on the Leinster House campus.  It is, as yet, not tested and it is hoped it is not tested before this committee, but the witnesses should be mindful of that for their own benefit.  If there was ever a challenge, they may not have the full privilege they would enjoy were they physically present in the building.<\/p> <p>  The format of the meeting is that we will take each organisation in turn, and the representative of each organisation will be invited to make a brief opening statement.<\/p><p>We have kept these at three minutes.

Gambling addiction and gambling-related harm are the forgotten issues of Irish society.  While they receive a substantial amount of media attention, they have in essence been ignored by the State.  There have been no meaningful statutory interventions to prevent and reduce gambling harm or to provide treatment for people with addictions or supports for affected others.  There has been no statutory public health campaign to warn people of the potential harms associated with gambling.  Addiction task forces are limited to dealing with drugs and alcohol.  While Ireland is one of the world&rsquo;s leaders in gambling industry innovation, we are laggards in providing safeguards to vulnerable adults and children.  As such, it is imperative that the gambling regulation Bill be enacted as soon as is humanly possible.<\/p> <p>  As members will know, the 2013 gambling control Bill was never enacted.  We will never know how many people have unnecessarily suffered from gambling-related harm in the intervening nine-year period.  The recently published Health Research Board survey, Gambling in the Republic of Ireland, found that there are 137,000 people experiencing low-risk, moderate-risk or problem gambling in Ireland.  International research has found that for every person with a gambling problem, an additional eight to ten people are negatively impacted.  These include children, partners, parents, siblings, friends, co-workers and employers.  Even at the lower end of that scale, this would mean that roughly one in four people in Ireland will be impacted by some degree of gambling harm in his or her lifetime.<\/p> <p>  The consumption of gambling is increasingly moving online.  As such, it should become easier to identify problematic, harmful gambling behaviours and intervene.  Most of the large online gambling operators that are licensed in Ireland are already tracking markers of harm, as required by the UK's Gambling Commission.  Many of these operators have artificial intelligence systems which can flag harmful gambling behaviours and automate interventions.  It is imperative that Ireland&rsquo;s future gambling regulatory authority have access to anonymised, randomised data sets in order to have a real-time overview of the level of problem gambling within operators&rsquo; customer bases.<\/p> <p>  In the recent past, many household name online gambling companies have received substantial fines from the UK's Gambling Commission for using this type of data to incentivise people with gambling problems to gamble more, rather than intervening to encourage the person to stop and seek help.  In the ongoing absence of gambling regulation in Ireland, how many people have been on the receiving end of these tactics here with no oversight?  How many vulnerable people with gambling problems and their loved ones have suffered as a result?  On behalf of the people who use our service, we urge the committee to ensure this Bill does not receive the same fate as the 2013 gambling control Bill.  I thank the Chair and members.  I will be happy to answer their questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2022032200002#B00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Barry Grant"},{"type":"speech","time":1647907200,"counter":856,"content":"<p>We will now move on to Dr. McAvoy's opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2022032200002#B00300","speaker":"1583"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1647907200,"counter":857,"content":"<p>The Institute of Public Health is an all-island organisation which is jointly funded by the Departments of Health in Ireland and Northern Ireland.  As individuals, and on behalf of the institute, we declare no conflict of interest in respect of the gambling industry.  I have a quick note on our view on the purpose of the Bill.  As Mr. Grant highlighted, there is no Government strategy to reduce gambling-related harms.  There is neither a roadmap for action across Government Departments nor any specified goals or targets.  This makes this Bill therefore a critical tool for change.<\/p> <p>  The programme for Government committed to bring forward legislation that protects public safety and well-being.  The measures in the Bill, in our view, must reduce the exposure of the overall population to gambling-related harms, reduce the incidence of problem gambling among children and adults and protect vulnerable people, most notably children, people with mental ill-health and those with problem gambling or who are experiencing multiple addictions.<\/p> <p>  We know that around one in four 15- and 16-year-olds in Ireland have gambled for money in the past 12 months.  This is therefore not a minority activity among children and young people.  Of those, approximately 5.7% are experiencing problem gambling.  It is our view that regulation in Ireland must focus on making gambling much less appealing and far less accessible for children, as well as less harmful for those who gamble.<\/p> <p>  In terms of adults, we know that for every person who is experiencing problem gambling, another six people are adversely affected.  There is a spectrum of gambling disorders that goes well beyond problem gambling.  We also know that problem gambling and mental ill-health are strongly related, albeit in complex ways.  For this reason, we would see regulation that reduces gambling-related harms through appropriate regulation having a protective role in relation to mental health, health inequalities and the reduction of poverty.<\/p> <p>  Our core recommendations are around pace and priority.  Reform of gambling regulation is certainly overdue.  It is important to public health, health inequalities and mental health.  Pace and priority are now vital.<\/p> <p>  In terms of heads 10 and 17, we recommend that provision be made to include public health expert representation on the membership of the authority and advisory committee.  In order to maintain public trust and adherence to the goals of public safety and well-being, conflict of interest will have to be very carefully managed.<\/p> <p>  We recommend some amendments to heads 49, 86 and 92 to better protect vulnerable groups.  These refer to limits applied to all gambling products, stakes, prizes and deposits, including those online, as well as to a scheme of escalating fines and a threshold that, if exceeded, triggers the revocation of a licence.  Breach of self-exclusion measures should incur an automatic loss of licence.<\/p> <p>  In relation to the protection of children, we have a particular concern around the role that advertising, marketing and sponsorship are playing in enhancing the appeal of gambling to children and young people and setting them on a path to progressing to at-risk gambling and into problem gambling.  We recommend that extensive regulation of marketing be included in the Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2022032200002#B00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Helen McAvoy"},{"type":"speech","time":1647907200,"counter":858,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. McAvoy.

It is very encouraged by the work of the committee to date in bringing this legislation forward.  Robust, effective regulation and enforcement are paramount to ensuring the highest standards are implemented across all operators in the Irish market and the protection of consumers, particularly those most vulnerable to engaging in harmful gambling activity.<\/p> <p>  The Gambling Awareness Trust is an independent charity that was established in 2019.  It is overseen by a voluntary board of directors to fund research, education and awareness, treatment and rehabilitation and supports to minimise gambling harm across Ireland.  We are funded by donations to a social responsibility fund via the Irish Bookmakers Association, IBA, its members and other online betting and casino operators.  However, not all sectors of the Irish gambling industry are contributing.  We request that a regulator ensure that non-contribution is no longer an option.<\/p> <p>  Since 2019, we have received over &euro;2.5 million in funding, &euro;2 million of which has been allocated to services which we carefully select, vet, monitor and supervise to ensure those who are seeking and receiving support are provided with the highest standards of care.  Over 1,000 individuals have been supported through this funding.  We commissioned Maynooth University to undertake research which resulted in the publication of the 2021 report, Gambling, Harms, Trends and Responses: Ireland in an International Context.  The findings of this report inform our current strategic plan.<\/p> <p>  We funded the design and development of two level 8 continuing professional development, CPD, specialist training courses for practitioners in the field.  We have funded online, television and radio awareness campaigns and we have developed dedicated websites and social media channels.  We provided funding for the first gambling addiction-specific residential programme at Cuan Mhuire, which opened in 2020.  We have developed the national problem gambling support service in collaboration with the National Forum of Family Resource Centres, which will be launched in the coming weeks.  We also fund the operation of the national helpline.<\/p><p>Regulation of the industry in Ireland is broadly welcomed by all sectors of society as it will ensure all operators are obliged to meet and implement the highest standards of practice, which will minimise gambling harm and protect the most vulnerable consumers.  The introduction of a statutory levy across all operators will secure significant funding for treatment and support services across the country, as well as the promotion of awareness and prevention measures and the production of much needed contemporary national research in the field.  Strict measures concerning sanctions and fines for breaches of practice will help ensure consistency in player protection.  Any funding accrued should be directed into national treatment and support services.<\/p><p> The operational structure of the Gambling Awareness Trust mirrors the proposed social impact fund set out in the Bill.  We strongly support this measure and, having developed a cost-effective, proactive strategy for managing funding and responding to need within a relatively short timeframe, we would be very happy to provide any information or support to the regulatory authority on the matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2022032200002#B00600","nonspeaker":"Ms Pam Bergin","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1647907200,"counter":861,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Bergin very much for that statement.

We would strongly suggest that financial limits be imposed.  One of the issues with financial limits is where the national lottery essentially operates as a monopoly.  It has a global 360 degree view of all the spending on its product.  With dozens or possibly hundreds of licensed online gambling operators coming into the Irish market, each operator only has its view of its slice of the pie.  A person could, therefore, be hitting limits with one and then going to the next.  The UK is now looking at a single customer view where people would make all their gambling transactions through a third party and affordability checks could be done through that third party.  That third-party organisation would have the 360 degree view of that person's spending across all gambling platforms.<\/p><p>Again, just as the gambling industry is constantly moving and innovating, some of the structures that would help prevent harm are also innovating.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2022032200002#C01600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Barry Grant","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1647907200,"counter":877,"content":"<p>I welcome the witnesses and thank them for their contributions and submissions.  On the dangers of gambling, gambling addiction and the damage it does, does anyone have a problem with the general thrust of the Bill, which seems to regard gambling as something that can be controlled but, in general, should not be discouraged?  In that context, I will raise a number of points.  First, in respect of amusement arcades or, as they are colloquially known, casinos, under the present law, one cannot operate a casino legally and it is a crime to do so in any area where the local authority has not adopted a resolution under Part III of the 1956 Act.  That is being flagrantly breached day in and day out in Dublin.  The Revenue Commissioners seem to be complicit in this criminal activity in that they are issuing licences to people to operate in places for which there is no local authority resolution.  I do not know what is happening with the Revenue Commissioners that they consider themselves to be entitled to license individual machines for operation in a manner that is criminal.  That is, however, what is happening.  I ask for feedback on that point.<\/p><p>I am also conscious of fixed-odds betting terminals, FOBTs.  The Bill seems to envisage that they will be licensable right across the country.  I do not see any planning control over where they will be made available or by whom they will be operated.  I do not see any policy in this legislation to stop this practice.  Fixed-odds betting terminals are a form of taxation on the gullible, to put it in the most benign way.<\/p><p>The third point I raise is on gambling generally.  I note an article in today&rsquo;s <i>The<\/i><i>Currency<\/i>, the online business magazine, by Fintan Drury, who was formerly in Paddy Power.  In it, he calls on Irish legislators to look at the problem of gambling, not simply to facilitate it with this legislation.  I can see Mr. Grant nodding.  Calling for this legislation to be enacted is to call for the widespread diversification of gambling unless we have countermeasures in place to keep gambling under control.  There is nothing in this proposed Bill about the number of licences that can be granted and nothing which discourages gambling arcades, or whatever, anywhere in the country.  I fully support the general drift of what the witnesses are saying, namely, that there are problems with gambling and there must be controls, but this proposed legislation does not do any of that.  It is silent on it and seems to be enabling gambling.  The very phrase &quot;the gambling industry&quot; prompts me to ask is this an industry that we want to encourage?  I am against it.  I am a liberal but I am against it because I see the damage it is doing to many people, including good friends of mine who have been destroyed by gambling addiction.  I am not a gambler myself, just in case anybody thinks I am a zealot.<\/p><p>Whereas this Bill brings in possibilities of control, the general scheme seems to be that gambling is fine.  I notice that head 69 proposes that anybody providing any goods or services can operate a lottery to encourage its purchase, with a limit of &euro;5,000 in prizes.  In other words, if you are selling widgets, biscuits or anything like that, you can, without a licence so long as the prizes remain under &euro;5,000, offer lottery-type inducements to purchase your goods.  Has any person queried whether this is a good or bad idea?  I do not see anybody doing this and I have to say that Fintan Drury&rsquo;s article today very much caught my attention in that he says that Irish legislators are sleepwalking effectively into a disaster which has already happened in England.  I would be interested to hear any of our guests' views on these points.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2022032200002#D00200","speaker":"1669"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1647907200,"counter":878,"content":"<p>There was a great deal in the Senator's contribution and I thank him for his thoughts and questions.

We are not trying to stop or prohibit gambling.<\/p> <p>  Harmful gambling should definitely be identified so that people know what it is.

We hear from our clients that there are bars in Ireland with FOBTs in them.  There are no bookmakers' shops because there is an unwritten gentleman&rsquo;s agreement in place.  There are pubs in Ireland which are doubly breaking the law because they are not supposed to have any gambling in them at all.  That concerns me along.  In our submission we propose that there would be no casino products in betting shops and sports betting licences would be kept completely separate from casino gaming licences.  We propose that the two products could not be in the same premises.<\/p> <p>  If there are no limits in the number of licences or potential machines in respect of FOBTs, that could potentially create a situation that is worse than the one that occurred in the UK which had massive issues with FOBTs because the UK at least had a rule limiting to four the number of FOBT machines per betting shop.  Then, of course, many of the gambling operators had multiple shops on the same high streets so they could put more machines in those high streets.  As per our submission, I would like to see a complete ban on FOBTs and a clampdown on illegal gambling in public houses.<\/p> <p>  On diversification, I am not entirely clear what the Senator was referring to there.  However, not to have a limit on the potential number of licences in the jurisdiction could be a problem, especially when we have a history of ignoring illegal gambling in places like Dublin city on a grand scale.  <\/p> <p>  I missed the &euro;5,000 lottery provision when we were going through the legislation.  That would concern me because some of our clients have certainly come across these technically illicit lotteries on social media platforms where one can pay &euro;20 and perhaps win a car or something like that.  This provision would expand and perhaps legitimise that practice even further.

I agree with Senator McDowell's remarks from earlier.  It seems to be just encouraging gambling.  Going from having no regulation to having some might be seen as an improvement, but if it does not restrict or put in place methods of restriction of gambling, then it will be problematic.  It will be donkey's years before we get to the point of debating it again and having legislation.<\/p> <p>  When I was a young fellow, which is years ago now, we used hang around the pubs when there was no work and we would be playing a game of cards, drinking minerals or whatever.  However, nowadays at home the bookies is the spot.  There is tea and coffee in there, you can sit at tables and there is everything like that.  The gambling is non-stop.  There is nobody in the pubs during the day now but the bookies is jam-packed.  That is a real problem because gambling addictions and gambling problems are far worse than alcohol or drugs at this stage. A person can gamble &euro;10,000 in one afternoon in a bookies.  That could destroy that person's life, that of his or her family, and that person could lose his or her house and everything like that, whereas with drink and drugs that takes much longer and there will be many more signs of a problem before that happens.  It is a real problem.  If this legislation does not address it, then it is something we will have to try to make right and address in some way.<\/p> <p>  There has been comment on the heads and so on but we have not seen the proposed legislation yet.  Do our guests think the legislation as proposed can go far enough?  Would they be willing or able to put forward possible suggestions for what needs to take place when the legislation is published so we can put them forward?  It is going to be very important.  Mr. Grant mentioned DNS blocking and so on.  That is something that needs to be in this legislation as well because there is going to have to be a legislative background to it for it to be used.  The Government will oppose it tooth and nail and it will never happen, but if it must be put forward, I will be quite happy to do that.  Will our guests give us suggested amendments and similar that might be strong enough to make this legislation work?<\/p> <p>  On the figures, the document states the prevalence of problem gambling in Ireland is 0.3% of the population, or 12,000 adults.  I think that has been way underestimated.  There is a need to stop online gambling, and I am aware with banks and others, you are transferred to a betting app and it is not presented as being a transfer to a betting app but a transfer to an anonymous company or something like that.  That is going to be a problem as well.  I am wondering how much we can actually protect against any of this with legislation and what needs to be done to make this legislation workable as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2022032200002#E00100","speaker":"1547"},{"type":"speech","time":1647907200,"counter":883,"content":"<p>I am not sure which of the witnesses wishes to answer that.

We have proposed some amendments to heads 49, 86 and 92 that ask for limits to be applied to all gambling products, stakes, prizes and deposits, including those online.  We also have recommended a scheme of escalating fines and a threshold that, if exceeded, would trigger a revocation of a licence.  At the moment, there are a number of fines and penalties but we feel the industry can well afford to pay some of these fines and continue with business as usual, so we need to up the level of deterrent to some of these potentially harmful interactions with problem gamblers where breach of self-exclusion incurs an automatic loss of licence.  They are some of the tougher measures we are proposing should be in legislation, especially with regard to protecting vulnerable groups.<\/p> <p>  The Bill could be more specific on regulation of advertising, especially in sport.  For us, sport plays a very important role in public health.  It promotes physical activity, child development and weight management, and for mental health it is fantastic.  We do not see the gambling industry having a role in the sponsorship of sport or the marketing and advertising of it.  That is a key point for us here.<\/p> <p>  I will pass over to my colleague Dr Reynolds on the matter of fixed odds betting terminals, FOBTs, as she is a little more experienced in this area than I am.  Very briefly on the issue of licensing, I agree the granting of a licence where it is against the spirit, if not the letter, of the law is problematic.  Also, where we see multiple licences for land-based betting in disadvantaged communities, it contributes to driving the problem into those low-income communities, driving urban decay and driving addiction problems in those communities.  There needs to be a very measured, appropriate approach to asking whether this licensing is in the public interest, if it is what the community wants and what the outcome of this will be for health and well-being in that community, so I agree with that.  I am not familiar enough with the intricacies around planning and local authority powers on the granting of licences, but that is the principle we would follow.<\/p> <p>  If the Chairman allows, I will pass over to Dr. Reynolds to deal with FOBTs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2022032200002#E00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Helen McAvoy"},{"type":"speech","time":1647907200,"counter":885,"content":"<p>Yes.

They draw on the addictive nature of gambling.<\/p> <p>  There are several ways we can intervene with these electronic gaming machines and FOBTs to minimise the harms.  The first is FOBTs should not be permitted in Ireland; they should be abolished completely.  We should look at the characteristics of electronic gaming machines and intervene with things such as near misses or losses disguised as wins.  There is much that can be done to limit stake sizes, deposit sizes, prizes and even speed cycles.  These are all ways in which we can intervene.

It is also a product that will become addictive to a certain percentage of the people who use it.  We do not allow the advertising of cigarettes any more, which is an over-18s addictive product, and we have greatly curtailed the advertising of alcohol, which is an over-18s addictive product.  If I were to ban one thing it would be to put a pre-watershed ban on all forms of gambling advertising.  I say that because we also know, and the Deputy mentioned research into young people, through the European School Survey Project for 2019, that Irish males aged 15 to 16 had a problem gambling prevalence rate of 1.7%, which is over five times the current or the believed problem gambling prevalence rate in the adult population.  We cannot keep normalising gambling as a healthy, happy and grown-up product that has no harms and expect young people not to be become addicted to it or develop unhealthy relationships with it.

They pointed out that a very small number of people who gamble go on to become problem gamblers and pointed out that it is a very tiny minority.  I made the point that I very infrequently gamble.  I buy the odd lottery ticket and I do not think that I have ever bet on a horse.  There are hundreds of thousands of people who infrequently bet.  Maybe they will place a bet at Cheltenham time or gamble once a month if one added it up over years.  Out of those many thousands of people there is a tiny minority who become problem gamblers but there is a smaller sector of people who watch the form of horses and frequently gamble every week.  If we considered the proportion of the latter who become problem gamblers the figure would be quite high.<\/p> <p>  Aside from creating serious harm, gambling also creates serious profits for the people and companies that engage in it.  Obviously the reason that they do it and push it to such an extent is that they make a huge amount of money.  Indeed, that does not just involve the people who engage in gambling.  There are industries that depend on it such as the horse racing industry.  I was a member of the agriculture committee for many years and crossed swords with Horse Racing Ireland about all of the State money that it took; most of it was given as prize money to very wealthy owners of racehorses yet I have seen people in the community lose everything when they bet on that industry.<\/p> <p>  What this Bill, and what all legislation tries to do, is strike a balance.  Our problem is that we must strike a balance.  As Senator McDowell has suggested, for the people who have a great problem then all of us would say that the way to solve the issue is to have no gambling at all.  However, the other night two men came to my door to sell a ticket for a local GAA club and that is gambling.  Many small organisations around the country engage in various lotteries and things to keep community projects and other things going but these activities involve an element of gambling.  We must strike a balance and this legislation must look at this area.  I accept that many people - I have met some - are addicted to lottery scratch cards.  We must target this legislation at the people who gamble a lot long term and for whom gambling has a negative impact on their lives.  We must find a way to accommodate them without punishing the other side of gambling, which is where people buy the odd lotto ticket or buys tickets from local clubs whether it is GAA, rugby or whatever.  That is where we must strike a balance and I am interested in hearing the attitude of the witnesses to that.  We often talk about what happens in a drugs scenario.  I mean people may start smoking cannabis but after a while it becomes a gateway drug and they get into the heavier stuff.  Is it a similar situation with gambling where people begin casually gambling but later it takes them down the path to addiction?<\/p><p>For a minority at least, that can be a very dangerous path.

There are also all the people around the problem gambler who experience harms from that gambling.  Sometimes we focus on just a small number of people and pretend, in a way, that this is a small, rare problem that happens to a restricted group of people, but that is not the case.<\/p> <p>  I do not know whether the people who have contributed to this debate previously have presented to the committee the figures on gambling among teenagers, which Mr. Grant raised.  I did not see it raised in the evidence provided by the commercial operators.  The reason we are emphasising this relates to the fact we foresee many problems coming down the line.  If that is the level of problem gambling we are seeing in 15- to 16-year-olds, particularly males, we will be in for a much greater problem.  That generation will have fallen severely foul of this gap in regulation and the explosion in online media advertising opportunities and the digital world in which they have grown up, compared with the guys who would have grown up going down to their local betting shop.  It is important to frame the problem in that way.<\/p> <p>  On the point about advertising, the UK Gambling Commission's Young People and Gambling study demonstrated a relationship between exposure to gambling advertising and gambling intentions in children aged between 11 and 16.  We may not have evidence of that from Ireland but I am satisfied the evidence from the UK demonstrates that relationship exists.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2022032200002#G00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Helen McAvoy"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1647907200,"counter":903,"content":"<p>On the numbers question, I wholly agree with Dr. McAvoy.  Among those who gamble more regularly, including those who have gambled in the past year, the rates of problem gambling, low-risk and moderate-risk gambling double.  A number of groups are disproportionately affected, which carries through into the childhood data.<\/p> <p>  The ESPAD data are quite worrying.  Only four countries have had a higher rate of sport or animal betting gambling prevalence than Ireland of the 33 countries that took part in the ESPAD, and only two countries had a higher or similar use of slot machines.  All these data are very concerning and show the direction we are going in adulthood, as Dr. McAvoy said.  Moreover, they indicate the types of gambling that children and young people have a tendency towards, and they help to inform where the protection measures can be placed.<\/p> <p>  Advertising and sponsorship most greatly affect those who have experienced problem gambling and children, who have not only a higher recall of gambling advertising but also a higher intention to bet after seeing advertising.  These vulnerable groups are affected disproportionately by advertising.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2022032200002#G00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Ciara Reynolds"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1647907200,"counter":904,"content":"<p>The target should be everybody.  I appreciate the Deputy was saying there is a tiny minority of people who become severely addicted to gambling and, obviously, we have to make a lot of interventions towards those people.  Nevertheless, as Desmond Tutu said, instead of pulling people out of the river, we need to go upstream and figure out why they are falling into the river in the first instance.  According to the Health Research Board's recent data, 90,000 people are at low risk, 35,000 are at moderate risk and 12,000 are in the problem gambling or addiction category.  Those at low risk have a one-in-three chance of ending up in the moderate-risk group, while those in that group have a one-in-three chance of ending up in the problem gambling group.  The larger the funnel is at one end among all the people who gamble, the more people will filter into the low-risk, moderate-risk and problem gambling categories.  We have to go all the way upstream and do prevention work, and we need to let people know gambling comes with harms.  It is not a harmless activity and it can be addictive.  We need to have interventions and safeguards all along the way.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2022032200002#G00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Barry Grant"},{"type":"speech","time":1647907200,"counter":905,"content":"<p>That concludes our engagement with our guests.
