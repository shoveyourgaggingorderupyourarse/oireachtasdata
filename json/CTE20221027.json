It is imperative that they comply with any such direction.<\/p><p>Members are reminded of the provisions within Standing Order 218 that the committee shall refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government, or a Minister of the Government, or the merits of the objectives of such policies.<\/p><p>Members are also reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not comment on, criticise, or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.<\/p><p>I now call on the Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, for his opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022102700002#A00600","speaker":"1491"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666859400,"counter":10,"content":"<p>The 2021 appropriation account for Vote 40 records gross expenditure of &euro;1.8 billion.  This was distributed across five output programmes that provide a broad range of services to meet the needs of children and of vulnerable persons in society.<\/p> <p>  Programme A provides for children and family support.  This is the largest area of spending under the Vote, at approximately &euro;888 million, or 49% of the total.  The grant to Tusla, amounting to &euro;857 million in 2021, represents the bulk of the spending on the programme.<\/p> <p>  Programme B comprises funding for a wide range of schemes and programmes to benefit children and young people, at a combined cost of &euro;680 million in 2021.  This area of spending has increased rapidly in recent years, and it was significantly affected by Covid-19 restrictions over the past two years.  Most of the schemes funded under the programme are administered by Pobal, acting as an agent on behalf of the Department.<\/p> <p>  Expenditure of just over &euro;200 million in 2021 was charged to programme E, which funds the provision of support for international protection seekers.<\/p><p>Most of the expenditure was in respect of accommodation for persons seeking international protection, accounting for &euro;191 million in 2021.  Members will be aware of the very significant additional pressures in that regard that have fallen on the Department in 2022, as a result of the Russian invasion of Ukraine.<br\/><br\/>The remaining two Vote programmes are on a smaller scale.  One supports a range of equality initiatives, the other caters for policy development and legislation within the Department&rsquo;s remit.  Due mainly to savings that occurred across the Vote, the surplus at the end of 2021 was &euro;98.5 million.  The Department was allowed to carry &euro;3.2 million over to 2022, to fund capital works, but surrendered &euro;95 million at the year end.<br\/><br\/>A clear audit opinion was issued in relation to the appropriation account.  However, I drew attention to the disclosure by the Accounting Officer in the statement on internal financial control regarding non-compliance with procurement rules.  This was mainly in relation to contracts put in place for the provision of accommodation to international protection seekers.<br\/><br\/>Members may also wish to note that, while the Department has been developing its ICT infrastructure, it still relied in early 2021 on the provision of financial management system services by the Department of Health.  This support service was interrupted as a result of the ransomware attack on health sector bodies that occurred in May 2021.  Work-around processes were adopted for a period, and completion of a planned migration of the Department&rsquo;s financial management service away from the Department of Health&rsquo;s systems was accelerated.  Normal financial management functions were resumed by the end of June 2021.<br\/><br\/>I turn now to the chapter which is on the agenda for today.  A guardian <i>ad litem<\/i>is an independent person appointed by a court to ensure the best interests and views of a child or children are heard in public family law proceedings.  While the service is provided at the direction of the courts, the costs of the service are discharged by Tusla, even though the organisation is a party to the family law proceedings.  The cost of the guardian <i>ad litem<\/i>service averages at &euro;14 million to &euro;15 million a year.  Costs vary widely at the individual case level.  I previously examined the operation of the guardian <i>ad litem<\/i>service, and published a report on my findings in September 2016.  That report contained three recommendations which, at the time, were agreed to by the Department and by Tusla.  Our examination this year found that the recommendations had not been implemented, for a variety of reasons.  However, a revised legislative<i><\/i>basis<i><\/i>for the provision of the guardian <i>ad litem<\/i>service was finalised in July of this year, with the enactment of the Child Care (Amendment) Act 2022.  This potentially removes the main obstacles that prevented progress being made in developing effective management oversight and control mechanisms for the service.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022102700002#A00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1666859400,"counter":12,"content":"<p>I welcome Mr. Kevin McCarthy back to the committee room.

I am accompanied by my colleagues Ms Carol Baxter, assistant secretary; Dr. Anne-Marie Brooks, assistant secretary; Ms Sheenagh Rooney, assistant secretary; and Ms Lara Hynes, acting assistant secretary.  We are also supported by Mr. Gordon Gaffney, finance officer; Mr. Andrew Patterson, principal officer; Ms Marie-Louise Molloy, professional accountant; Ms Erin Ryle, administrative officer; and David Byrne, principal officer.  <br\/><br\/>In my opening statement I will give a very brief overview of the main features of the Vote.  I hope the more detailed briefing supplied in advance of the meeting is of assistance to the committee in providing a fuller picture of the work of the Department and its expenditure.  As we all know, the year 2021 brought ongoing challenges from the Covid-19 pandemic which continued to impact on how we delivered services and required ongoing adaptation and innovation in order to support our objectives to enhance the lives of children and young people, adults, families and communities; to recognise diversity; and to promote equality of opportunity in Ireland.  <br\/><br\/>During the year there were some minor changes to the responsibilities under the remit of the Department.  There was a transfer out of functions related to education welfare services from the Department to the Department of Education and responsibility for the Balance for Better Business initiative transferred to the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  Both transfers took effect from January 2021.  The total provision for the Vote in 2021 was &euro;1.923 billion which included capital carryover of &euro;4.1 million.  <br\/><br\/>In terms of the Vote, three spending areas represent almost 90% of the overall Vote spending in 2022, namely Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, early learning and childcare, and international protection seekers' accommodation.  The current expenditure allocation was &euro;1.887 billion, with a further &euro;36.1 million allocated for capital expenditure, including capital carryover.  The net allocation for the Vote was &euro;1.884 billion when appropriations-in-aid of &euro;39.1 million are taken into account.  The final outturn for the Vote in 2021 was &euro;1.785 billion, with a surplus of &euro;98.5 million of which &euro;3.2 million is to be deferred as capital carryover to 2022 leaving a total to be surrendered at year end of &euro;95.3 million.  <br\/><br\/>During 2021, Covid-19 continued to impact on spending across all areas of the Vote.  In Quarter 1 of 2021, the Early Childhood Care and Education Programme, ECCE, was suspended and access to other early learning and childcare services were restricted to children of essential workers and children experiencing disadvantage.  Moreover, for the remainder of 2021, there was a reduced demand for early learning and childcare owing to changes in parental working arrangements and other Covid-19-related issues.  This led to savings across all early learning and childcare funding programmes, namely ECCE, access and inclusion model, AIM, and the national childcare scheme, and resulted in an underspend of &euro;46.7m, or 7% of the allocation of &euro;640.2 million for early learning and childcare. <br\/><br\/>The impact of Covid-19 also contributed to an underspend of &euro;27.2 million, or 12% of the 2021 provision of &euro;218 million for international protection seekers' accommodation and related services costs.  It should be noted that restrictions on international travel resulted in lower than anticipated arrivals and demand for international accommodation.  Towards the end of 2021 as we emerged from Covid-19 restrictions, expenditure across the Vote, particularly in areas such as early learning and childcare and international protection accommodation, started to rebound and this has continued apace into 2022.  All other areas on the Vote also started to return to normal patterns of spending.  <br\/><br\/>When I addressed the committee in June, I referenced the significant impact the outbreak of the war in Ukraine was having on the work of the Department.  The demands of this situation have not abated in the meantime.  The Department&rsquo;s role in the humanitarian response to the needs of Ukrainians arriving here under the temporary protection directive continues to pose major challenges and has involved a significant diversion and allocation of staffing resources.  The parallel and significant increase in numbers of applicants for international protection in 2022 has also placed extreme pressure on resources.  The overall requirements of this response, including the use of various forms of emergency accommodation, has had, and will continue to have, a significant impact on costs in 2022 and beyond as the Department continues to deal with the twin challenges of providing accommodation for Ukrainians and other international protection applicants.  <br\/><br\/>I refer also to Chapter 13 of the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s Report on the Accounts of the Public Services 2021.  This chapter is a follow-up report on guardian <i>ad litem <\/i>or GAL reform.  As the committee is aware, GALs are appointed in child care proceedings to ascertain the views of the child and communicate these to the court.  The GAL also makes recommendations to the court as to what is in the best interests of the child.  The Department has acknowledged that the present arrangements for GAL services are in need of significant reform.  Work has been ongoing for several years to provide the legislative underpinning necessary for this reform.  The committee will be aware that the Child Care (Amendment) Act 2022, which provides for the reform of the GAL system, and will enable the<br\/><br\/>Minister to establish a new national GAL service, was signed into law on 19 July.  The Department intends to publish a request for tender in the coming weeks for the development of an operating model and practice manuals for the new GAL service and legal services unit.  This will build on significant work already undertaken, including costings prepared for different models of the service, the development of an IT system to be used by GALs for case management, and extensive discussions with relevant stakeholders.  The Department also has sanction for a director post for the new office, and intends to recruit a<br\/><br\/>director for the service next year.  It is expected that the body of work to establish the executive office and the new national service will continue throughout 2023 and into 2024.  The purpose of this reform is to regulate and expand the provision of GAL services in a consistent manner across the country.  The reformed service will enhance the rights of children and the capacity of the courts to make the right decisions in helping children and their families.<\/p><p>The reformed service will enhance the rights of children and the capacity of the courts to make the right decisions in helping children and their families.  I am satisfied that it can also address the concerns raised in the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General regarding the costs of the service and the lack of transparency and oversight that exists under the current unregulated system.<\/p><p> Finally, in reviewing the 2021 accounts, I would like to take this opportunity to thank all my colleagues in the Department, and our partner agencies and providers, for the enormous contributions they have made in sustaining delivery on so many our objectives during 2021 and since in the face of successive unprecedented challenges from the Covid-19 pandemic and the war in Ukraine.  I thank the committee members and Chairman for their attention and look forward to taking their questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022102700002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Kevin McCarthy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1666859400,"counter":15,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. McCarthy.

Some 43,000 people have been accommodated by the State and 43,000 medical cards have been issued.  Ten thousand have found employment.

I ask that our guests would put together a register of those.

The minute of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform is the official response to the recommendations of this committee.  I raised this matter with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform last week as the minute is not in line with the Department&rsquo;s own circular, that is, Circular 01\/2011.

That has not been done in regard to any of the recommendations in our report.

At some point, someone - whether it is this committee or someone else - will need to look at how we got this so wrong on so many different levels such that the outlay to the taxpayer was far beyond what anybody would have dared suggest at the outset.  I have no doubt that one of the problems that will be identified is the level of secrecy and lack of transparency throughout the process.  In order for this committee to be vindicated, we need to continuously record our dissatisfaction with the way in which information is being withheld.  This correspondence from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform informs the committee that the Department of Health has stated that the information relating to costings is commercially sensitive.  I propose that we write back to the Department of Health again to express our view that the information should be provided to the committee and requesting that this should be done, if for no other reason than to ensure that it will be on the public record that the committee did everything to try to have throughout the process the accountability that has been sadly lacking.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022102700002#BB00500","speaker":"1451"},{"type":"speech","time":1666859400,"counter":894,"content":"<p>I agree with both Deputies.  The issue I am concerned about is that we were told that we are more than 70% of the way through this contract and there is no final price.  We do not even have a ballpark figure for the final price.  We have made numerous efforts in respect of this matter.  It is two years and three months since we started trying to shed some light on it.  If a person was three quarters of the way through building a house and still did not know the final price, it would not be a good place to be.  I am not too sure what you would tell the bank in such circumstances.  The bank in this case is of course Joe Public.  I suggest that we write to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to ask whether it knows what will be the final cost.  We do not know; we are not being told.  As Deputy Carthy correctly stated, the letter dated 14 October 2022 indicates that in light of the fact that a commercially sensitive contract is in operation, any queries about final costs of the project should be directed to the Department of Health.  I propose that we write to Mr. Moloney to ask whether he knows and also write to the Secretary General of the Department of Health, Mr. Robert Watt.  Mr. Watt was the Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform when this contract for the national children's hospital was put in place.

Having looked at similar projects abroad, there are two issues.  One is that the main infrastructure has now been built and there is a major issue regarding disputes between the contractors and the project team.  However, one of the issues that is out of the way relates to the substantial increase in building costs.  We are lucky that the main infrastructure was in place before we ended up with a major increase in costs.  If we had started this project last year, it would have increased by much more in a shorter timeframe.  The problem we have relates to the various issues under dispute.  My understanding from the previous discussion is that there are 700 or 800 issues and that these have been parked.

There is a perception of a saving, by virtue of the fact that we do not have organisations like for example, the Corporate Enforcement Agency that has been set up, properly resourced.  It was guaranteed 16 members of the Garda but only has seven at the moment.  It still does not have its full complement.  It cannot do its work if it does not have the resources.  If we do not have organisations that can properly regulate and enforce, we will then end up paying in retrospect by way of inquiries.  We really have to grasp the nettle on this.<\/p> <p>  I have a previous response that I got from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform going back to 2019 on this issue.  The cost of inquiries at the end of 2018 was &euro;457 million, almost half a billion euro, and it lists those costs down.  That is right across all Departments, where each would have been the parent Department, whereas this is exclusively related to the Department of the Taoiseach.  Some of them were included in this response.  I can look at the response this committee got in 2019 and at the one we are discussing at the moment.  The investigation into certain matters relating to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is down at &euro;3.5 million.  When I look at this reply that I got previously, it makes me wonder if it was the same inquiry.  I am not sure if there were two.

It is a proposal for the committee to make inquiries regarding the change of ownership in respect of the national broadband plan.  Does Deputy Murphy wish to come in on that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022102700002#DD02500","speaker":"1491"},{"type":"speech","time":1666859400,"counter":947,"content":"<p>When the Department was before the committee a couple of weeks ago, I pursued it on this particular topic and it looked like the new entity was nearing completion.

We will note and publish No. 1516C.<\/p> <p>  No. 1522C, dated 19 October 2022, is from an individual and relates to the use of public funds to support Ukraine.  The correspondent takes the view that the State is participating in the war and is, therefore, breaching Article 28.3 of the Constitution which states \"War shall not be declared and the State shall not participate in any war save with the assent of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.\"  This matter has been raised in the Houses and is one for the D&aacute;il and Seanad.  The role of this committee is to examine related expenditure of the relevant State bodies once their accounts have been circulated.  I propose to advise the correspondent of that.  I have flagged up the issue.  The correspondent quotes the Constitution, on which I think all members have a handle.  The issue is whether it is the role of the committee to decide whether neutrality has been breached.  To substantiate his case, the correspondent supplied a copy of extracts of what he said were from a speech by the Minister for Defence, Deputy Coveney.  I suggest we write to the Minister to ask for a response because the correspondent quotes him making certain statements on 29 April 2022 at an event in the John Fitzgerald Kennedy centre in Boston.  Is it agreed that we send the correspondence to the Minister seeking a response?  This is not really the role of the committee.  It is a matter for the Oireachtas to define, make rules and decide on our position on neutrality and it is up to the Houses to interpret and define neutrality and decide whether we are going beyond it.  I heard part of a discussion this week in the D&aacute;il.  It would be useful to get clarity on that because funding is being provided, we want to be clear on what it is being used for.  The Minister is entitled to an opportunity to respond.  We have these quotations.  I was not familiar with the speech the Minister is quoted as having given on 29 April.  We will ask him for a response.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.<\/p> <p>  Moving on to our work programme, next week is a non-sitting week due to the Hallowe'en bank holiday.

We filed a detailed report and opening statement with the committee about this matter.  I will confine my opening statement to the first five pages but I hope the detail provided will be useful in clarifying some matters and providing information to the members of the committee.<\/p> <p>  I am joined by my colleagues, Mr. Eamon Lonergan, director of services, planning and development, water services in Thurles Municipal District, and by Mr. Denis Holland, senior engineer, water services.<\/p> <p>  As we are all aware, this petition relates to the taking in charge of the residential development at Rocksprings, Kilross, County Tipperary.  l will outline some local and national issues that have impacted on the taking in charge of Rocksprings to enable the committee to have a full understanding of the role of Tipperary County Council in this process.<\/p> <p>  First, I will provide some background about the residential development at Rocksprings, Kilross.  The development consists of five houses and was developed by Mr. Terence Coskeran on foot of a grant of approval issued in 2003.  It is served by a stand-alone developer-provided wastewater treatment plant, commonly known as a DPI.  I will not go through appendix 1 but I refer members to it as it sets out more details in relation to the grant of approval.<\/p> <p>  Tipperary County Council acknowledges that Rocksprings has been built and maintained to an acceptable standard.  In particular, the infrastructure serving the estate, including the water services infrastructure, does not present any issues of concern to the local authority.<\/p> <p>  I will move on to some general comments on taking in charge.  The legislative provisions for taking in charge are set out in section 180 of the Planning and Development Act 2000.<\/p><p>Prior to the establishment of Irish Water on 1 January 2014, the taking-in-charge process was solely within the remit of the local authority.  However, the transfer of responsibility for water services from the local authority to Irish Water in 2014 has changed the procedure for the taking in charge of residential estates.  lrish Water has clarified in correspondence, as early as 2014, that a local authority may not take in charge water services infrastructure without its consent.<\/p><p> The engagement between a local authority and lrish Water in relation to the taking-in-charge process is set out more fully in a memorandum of understanding, MOU, dated 4 March 2015.  However, the MOU does not cover residential estates, such as Rocksprings, which are served by stand-alone developer provided water services infrastructure, DPl.  I refer the committee to appendix 2 in which I have outlined more detail on that.<\/p><p> The issue before the committee, namely, the development of private infrastructure, is a national one.  Responsibility for DPIs is a national issue.  This is recognised in the MOU referred to above which stated, in relation to residential estates that are served by stand-alone developer provided infrastructure such as wells, water treatment plants and wastewater treatment plants, that the then Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, the water services transition office and lrish Water were currently working to put in place a national strategy, including funding to address deficiencies in these estates and that guidance on this matter will be issued in due course.<\/p><p> It is understood that as at December 2018, and this figure may be subject to change, a total of 834 residential estates were recorded nationally as being served by DPIs.  I can confirm that 25 of these estates are located within County Tipperary and are the subject of valid taking-in-charge applications with the planning section.  There are another nine DPI estates in the county which, for one reason or another, have not been the subject of taking-in-charge applications.<\/p><p> Currently, responsibility for a DPI rests with the developer of the estate.  The local authority cannot take the estate in charge unless lrish Water agrees to assume responsibility for the DPl.  This is not happening and as there is no national agreement in place, there is a lack of progress on the taking-in-charge process of these particular estates.  This issue is a legacy from the transformation of water services to lrish Water and warrants a national resolution.  I refer the committee appendix 3, which explores this issue in more detail.<\/p><p> I turn to the taking in charge of Rocksprings.  Although the council received correspondence dated March 2013 from the residents of the estate, a valid application to take the Rocksprings estate in charge was received by Tipperary County Council on 11 July 2016. At various dates in the intervening period until the present, the developer, Mr. Coskeran, and various public representatives on his behalf, both national and local, were informed by the council that, while on initial inspection, the development was well constructed and the public areas well maintained, the council would be unable to progress the taking in charge of this development due to the presence of the wastewater treatment plant on the site.  More details are set out in appendix 4.<\/p><p> Notices of motions on the taking in charge of Rocksprings were submitted by the elected members at the local district of Tipperary County Council in both 2018 and 2022, respectively.  In respect of the former, a reply from lrish Water indicated that the current Government guidelines specifically excluded estates such as Rocksprings which have their own wastewater treatment systems built by the developer.  In respect of the latter, a reply from legal services in lrish Water referred to the MOU which excludes the taking in charge of residential estates with DPIs and that lrish Water was not in a position to consider taking in charge the wastewater infrastructure within the Rocksprings estate.  It must also be noted that in the case of Rocksprings, the taking in charge is not within the remit of the elected members of Tipperary County Council due to the transfer of the local authority's water services functions to lrish Water.  I refer the committee to appendix 7 for more detail on that.<\/p><p> I turn to the broader issue of taking in charge of estates by Tipperary County Council.  As chief executive of Tipperary County Council, I am conscious of the challenges presented in the taking in charge of residential developments.  I am committed to putting resources and procedures in place to monitor progress in this area and to accelerate the process.  In particular, I have established an in-house working group, chaired by the director of services for planning, consisting of senior staff from planning, roads, water services and, where relevant, environment.  Not alone does this working group report to the council's management team on a regular basis, more critically it presents quarterly updates to the 40 elected members of Tipperary County Council at their district meetings.  As the Chairman knows, we have five districts in the county.<\/p><p> I am glad to say that much progress has been made in County Tipperary in the taking in charge of residential developments and, to date, a total of 122 housing estates have been taken in charge since 2014.  I have given more details on that and a breakdown year-by-year in appendix No. 5.  I can assure the committee that Tipperary County Council remains committed to the taking in charge of the remaining estates.<\/p><p> In the case of Rocksprings, the council would like to proceed as quickly as possible with its taking in charge.  However, it cannot do so without the agreement of lrish Water as the water services authority, or some national agreement on the responsibility for DPIs within the taking-in-charge process for the reasons outlined above.  I empathise with the situation in which Mr. Coskeran finds himself which he alone cannot resolve.  However, I hope it is appreciated that we also find ourselves in a situation which we alone cannot resolve either.<\/p><p> I turn to the issue of the multi-annual developer-provided infrastructure resolution programme, which ran between 2019 and 2021.  This programme was launched by the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage on 23 July 2019 to address the issue of stand-alone developer-provided infrastructure, principally wastewater treatment plants, to progressively enable the taking in charge of residential estates served by DPIs.  Tipperary County Council, led by its planning section, submitted a funding bid to the Department on 17 September 2019 in relation to this programme.  Rocksprings was included as priority number four in the submission, which contained 11 estates.  That gives some indication as to the prioritisation we attached to the Rocksprings estate.<\/p><p> The council sought funding of &euro;53,500 for a gravity connection from the Rocksprings DPI to the wastewater treatment plant serving the adjacent local authority housing estate at Hillview.  On 22 September 2020, the council was notified that its submission in relation to Rocksprings was unsuccessful.  The expert panel, which assessed the submissions, stated the following in relation to Rocksprings: \"The Expert Panel considers the bid to be premature for approval under the current funding cycle of the multi-annual programme as issues with the responsibility in the long-term for the enabling sewerage scheme needs to be resolved before funding approval can be recommended.\"  I have included more detail on that in appendix 6.<\/p><p> I turn to communication received from the Department in 2022.  The council's rural water team received a letter from the rural water unit of the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, dated 9 June 2022.  The letter indicated that at the request of the Department, lrish Water would be carrying out a technical assessment of the wastewater treatment plant serving the adjoining Hillview housing estate to determine whether Rockspring&rsquo;s could be connected to it.  This technical assessment has been completed and we understand a report has been submitted to the Department.  Further developments are awaited in this regard.  For the information of the committee, appendix 8 sets out more detail on this initiative by the Department.  Also set out is some background information in relation to the Hillview residential estate and to small municipal wastewater treatment plants in general.  This initiative by the Department is most welcome.<\/p><p> Regarding Rocksprings and future proposals, I know the Chairman, members of the committee and Mr. Coskeran, in particular, are seeking a resolution to this issue, as are we.  I would like to put forward the following proposals as a way forward to allow the estate to be taken in charge but there are a number of elements to this.  First, lrish Water has to accept responsibility for the operation and maintenance of the agglomeration of Kilross, which consists of the wastewater treatment plant serving the local authority housing estate at Hillview.  Second, lrish Water has to carry out a condition survey of this Hillview waste water treatment plant to assess its capacity to cater for increased loading in the event that the Rocksprings plant was connected to it.  As I mentioned earlier, we understand that technical assessment has been undertaken and the report has been submitted to the Department.  Third, in the event that a programme of works is identified, on foot of this, the cost of this can be estimated and funding identified for these works.  I want it noted that we are not putting costs or budgets as an issue in relation to the resolution of this issue.  We believe that if the other issues can be overcome, the funding issue will be overcome as well.  Fourth, the execution of such a programme of works can be finalised, which would include the decommissioning of the Rocksprings wastewater treatment plant and agreement as to how these works would be carried out.  It will be necessary for lrish Water to apply to the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, to amend the existing certificate of authorisation for Kilross to incorporate Rocksprings.  Finally, Tipperary County Council could then proceed, without delay, to follow the statutory procedures and complete the taking-in-charge process in respect of Rocksprings and I can assure the Chairman that it would do so as quickly as is statutorily possible.  lf this proposal is not possible as a solution, although I hope it is, I would have to submit that resolution will have to be part of the determination of any future national arrangements in relation to DPIs.  As I mentioned, there are more than 800 of these across the country.<\/p><p> I again thank the committee for the invitation to come before it today.  I hope that this statement has outlined to it the position of Tipperary County Council on the subject matter of Mr. Coskeran's petition, with particular reference to the factors which act as constraints to the council finalising the taking in charge of the residential development at Rocksprings, Kilross.<\/p><p>I have presented a proposed way forward for this particular estate, which will require input and agreement from Tipperary County Council, the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Irish Water, and the EPA.  Tipperary County Council is willing to work with all stakeholders to deliver a solution.  I can assure this committee that the council remains committed to the taking in charge of housing estates, and our recent track record demonstrates the progress made across the county with 122 estates taken in charge over the last eight years.  The constraints mentioned in this opening statement are national legacy issues, which have resulted from the transfer of powers, ownership, responsibilities and authorisation from local authorities to Irish Water.  Solutions to these issues will need to be addressed as part of national discussions around the transformation of the water services sector.  Ultimately, the resolution of DPIs requires a national solution to be reached between the various national stakeholders, including the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Irish Water and the local authority sector and other agencies.

Nobody is taking responsibility for estates like the one built by Mr. Coskeran.  Everyone in the Oireachtas hears daily about developments being left to become ghost estates.  We have a developer here who built a small estate and everybody admitted the work was top of the range.  To my mind and I am sure in the opinion of others he has been treated worse than developers who walked away and left ghost estates.  There needs to be a quick resolution.  I want to ask a couple of questions before I leave.  Can the council explain why the Department said the decision as to whether any particular estate should be taken in charge is ultimately one for the elected members of the local authority?  Yet in your opening statement you said Irish Water clarified in correspondence as early as 2014 that a local authority may not take water service infrastructure in charge without its consent.  Does that not effectively show there is little understanding of the memorandum of understanding?  It leads to the overall question as to who is responsible for the bind Mr. Coskeran and Rocksprings are currently in?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CPP2022102700002#C00200","speaker":"1613"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666825200,"counter":976,"content":"<p>In a broader context the issue of developer provided infrastructure is a national one.  We have had a transition of water services from local authorities to Irish Water and the memorandum of understanding put in place in relation to other estates is working very effectively.  However, what we need at national level is a similar memorandum of understanding in relation to how we deal with estates served by DPIs.  That is needed for Rocksprings and for the more than 800 other estates in a similar situation around the country.  With regard to the responsibility for taking estates in charge, I set out in my opening statement that the responsibility for this is set out in section 180 of the planning and development Act and also in the roads Act.  It is a reserved function of the elected members to pass a resolution.  Bear in mind that the elected members of Tipperary County Council have passed 122 resolutions in the last eight years taking estates in charge.  Normally what happens is the process gone through complies with the memorandum of understanding, MOU, and once the works on the estate are brought up to an acceptable standard, we will bring forward the report to the elected members for consideration.  As part of that they have to consider the financial implications of taking in charge and we set that out.  That works well for the vast majority of estates.  The difficulty is in relation to why the taking in charge is a reserved function of the elected members.  The difficulty is that since 2014 responsibility for water services has transferred to IrishF Water so the elected members cannot pass a resolution to take in charge water services infrastructure.  What happens in relation to estates generally is that when they pass a resolution Tipperary County Council takes responsibility for the roads, public lighting and open areas, and Irish Water takes responsibility for the water services.  There is no similar agreement in place in relation to DPI estates.  That is the situation we find ourselves in.  I accept our responsibility to solve this but we cannot solve this alone.  It will require the input of Irish Water, Tipperary County Council and the Department and, as there is a certificate of authorisation in relation to the wastewater treatment at Hillview, it also requires the input of the EPA.  That is the situation.  It is very important to understand that the elected members of Tipperary County Council have been very much to the forefront of taking estates in charge.  There is no shyness or reticence on our part to do that.  We have done so.  However, there is a particular issue in relation to estates with DPIs.  As I mentioned, there are 25 other estates in Tipperary alone in a similar situation.  We believe there is a particular solution for Rocksprings that might be brought forward and which I have outlined in my report and opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CPP2022102700002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Joe McGrath"},{"type":"speech","time":1666825200,"counter":977,"content":"<p>I appreciate that, but the agreement and contract was between Mr. Coskeran and Tipperary County Council in 2004.

You said in your opening statement that taking in charge cannot be carried out without the consent of Irish Water.  However, in the letter to Mr. Coskeran from the council in July 2016, advising that it would be processed in due course, there was no mention of Irish Water.  He got another letter on 15 March 2017 from Tipperary County Council confirming that his application had been submitted and was being processed.  Again, there was no mention of Irish Water.

We are not in a position to take in charge an estate and complete the statutory process unless Irish Water has been satisfied in relation to the condition to the water services within it.

The housing problem will not be resolved unless we get small developers like Mr. Coskeran to build five or six houses in these areas.<\/p><p>Everybody agrees that the works were carried out to the high standard.  We now have a situation where Mr. Coskeran finds that he cannot get his estate taken in charge.  The reason it has dragged on this long is that we now have four bodies, namely, Tipperary County Council, the Department, Irish Water and the EPA, kicking the can around the circle.  This is the nice way of saying it at this stage.  Someone needs to take responsibility.  Before I allow other members in, I would ask if any of the witnesses can tell the committee who is responsible for bringing Rocksprings into the public system?  The wastewater plant in Hillview, which is beside it, is under the control of Irish Water.  Is that a public wastewater system?  It appears to be.  If the wastewater system in Hillview is capable of taking the extra load, which we have been told it is, then a very easy solution would be for Rocksprings to be connected to that system.  No one from the council, Irish Water or the Department seems to be prepared to look at that or go out and check on it.  I know it is one of the proposals that is down as a solution but why has it not been looked at before this?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CPP2022102700002#C00700","speaker":"1613","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666825200,"counter":982,"content":"<p>It has been looked at, Chairman.  First, I will go back a little.  The local authority housing estate at Hillview was the subject of an application by the local authority to the EPA for what is called a certificate of authorisation.  That was granted.  On 1 January 2014 the EPA, as it did in relation to all similar agglomerations, county-wide and country-wide, transferred that certificate of authorisation in the name of Irish Water.  If one looks up the EPA website, one will see that as far as the EPA is concerned, the holder of the relevant certificate of authorisation for that treatment plant is Irish Water.<\/p> <p>  The possibility of Rocksprings connecting into the plant was the subject of the technical assessment that was carried out in June of this year.  In partnership with the local authority, Irish Water did a major investigation of that treatment plant to see whether it was capable of receiving the extra effluent from Rocksprings.  I understand that Irish Water was satisfied that the plant could take the extra effluent.  However, there may have been some concerns in relation to the condition of the receiving water, bearing in mind the additional treated effluent that would be coming into it.  That would require further attention.  That report, which was referred to in the opening statement, was sent to the Department and further developments in that area are awaited.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CPP2022102700002#D00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Denis Holland"},{"type":"speech","time":1666825200,"counter":983,"content":"<p>As I said at the start, I need to leave so I am going to ask Deputy Devlin to replace me until I come back.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CPP2022102700002#D00300","speaker":"1613"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1666825200,"counter":984,"content":"<p>Deputy Cormac Devlin took the chair.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1666825200,"counter":985,"content":"<p>I was in construction for years.  I did sewerage and water works so I know what we are talking about here.  I am very frustrated on behalf of Mr. Coskeran.  I can now see some part of the picture of where the county council is coming from but I have a number of questions.  The DPIs categorises estates according to the number of residential units.  Category three estates contain under 50 residential units and category four estates contain under five residential units.  Mr. Coskeran had five homes.  The council would have been aware of this a number of years ago.  When the circular came out from the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government for the only tranche of moneys for the DPIs, why was Mr. Coskeran's one not applied for?  What I am trying to find out is who has really messed up here?  Mr. McGrath stated earlier that it was a failed transition from the council to Irish Water.  Before the municipal councils, the county councils and the town councils were the local experts when it came to water connections and water repairs.  That is one cock up, we will call it.<\/p> <p>  I refer to the category four estates.  I am trying to get to who is really responsible here because this came out under the framework for the multi-annual DPIs.  The council will not even be able to apply for this because if Mr. Coskeran's estate falls under the under five residential units, it is on the tipping point.  Given the likely limited public or water environment impact of a small-scale treatment system of legacy DPI estates, local authorities are not being asked for bids for them in the current funding cycle.  That means that even if funding for Mr. Coskeran's estate had been applied for, it probably would have met resistance because it was on right on the button with five houses.<\/p> <p>  I need to know who is responsible for this.  The witnesses' hands seem to be tied but they seem to be tied for a very long time.  There seems to be no cohesion between Irish Water and the councils.  Is it the Department that has messed up here?  Even if we get an answer to that question, the biggest problem here is that this has been going on for years.  There are five families in homes in that estate.  I cannot understand how we have to come to this point over a number of years of back and forth and yet it is the families of those five homes who are suffering and they are suffering at a cost.  I will not get into the property tax.  If the estate is not taken in charge, is it classed as a derelict estate?  Are they being charged for property tax that they should not be paying?  There are many questions here but I do need that one answered.<\/p> <p>  I was going to ask why the DPI was not applied for but now I can see the reason.  That points the finger at the Department.  Was Irish Water ever contacted when this situation came up to inform it of the fact that work on a connection to this estate was being blocked? That is one question.<\/p> <p>  I will go back to my second question.  Who in the witnesses' opinion is responsible for the mess here?  I will move on to my third question, although I know it was stated in the conclusions.  Going back to the last petitions committee, there were five separate entities involved in inland fisheries coming up with five different plans for one dam on a river.  We brought them all into the committee and they sat down together.  The suggestion from the committee was that the five entities came up with a single plan that all could sign off on.  Why is there such a disparity between the council, Irish Water, which I am not a fan of, and the Government?  We should not even be here.  This should be a very simple thing but from the statement, I feel that Irish Water is hiding behind one mess because it is all about granting additional money.  A substantial amount of money was given out in the first tranche - &euro;6 million in 2019, &euro;10 million in 2020 and &euro;12 million in 2021.  That is handy money for a few estates.<\/p> <p>  Who has really messed up here?  Why did the council not apply for funding under the multi-annual developer provided water services infrastructure resolution programme in 2019 if it was aware of Mr. Coskeran's estate?  I reiterate my second question.  Who does the council believe is responsible for this mess?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CPP2022102700002#D00500","speaker":"1452"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666825200,"counter":986,"content":"<p>I can assure Deputy Buckley that we applied for funding for Rocksprings.  When the Department announced the multi-annual programme in 2019, it invited local authorities to make submissions, to make funding bids, as it were.<\/p><p>We made a detailed submission in September of that year.  We identified 11 estates within our county that would be eligible for funding under the programme.  We prioritised those and put Rocksprings at No. 4 on the list of 11.  It was referred to in the chief executive's opening statement.  If the committee refers to appendix 6 of the statement, it gives more details.  We set out the proposal, which was broadly along the lines referred to in our proposal for the future development or action to resolve Rocksprings, and that was to connect the wastewater treatment plant from Rocksprings into the adjoining estate in Hillview.<\/p><p> The Department established an expert panel to review all the funding submissions that have come in from the different local authorities in the country.  The expert panel published its report in September 2020, which the Department accepted.  In respect of Rocksprings, it said the expert panel considered the bid to be premature for approval under the current funding cycle of the programme as issues with the responsibility in the long term for the enabling sewerage scheme, by which they meant the adjoining one at Hillview, needed to be resolved before funding approval could be recommended.  As the chief executive has said, there is a national resolution required to resolve the DPI issue, not alone in County Tipperary but nationally.  In the short term, we have proposed a local solution.  If it not possible to expedite and progress on that, we will then have to seek a national solution and for Rocksprings to be included in that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CPP2022102700002#D00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Denis Holland","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1666825200,"counter":988,"content":"<p>I thank the witness for that answer.

This is a major issue, and we will try to use the polite word because I am very frustrated that this has been going on for years and no one contacted the Department in Dublin nor did anyone flag it.  What seems to have happened, unfortunately, is that while it is totally within the remit of the council, nobody wanted to step outside the box, use the common-sense approach and say it needed to be flagged up.  There are directly elected councillors in each county and even the thought of taking the power off them to vote on stuff regarding these estates in their own county is shocking.

The surveys were carried out going back as far as 2015 to establish the scale of this and, as Mr. McGrath has explained, there are 834 of these estates across the country.  The estimated expenditure will go into hundreds of millions to resolve these.  It is very much on the national agenda and both the Department and Irish Water are very well aware of it.  Ultimately, where we are going to see the resolution of this, because it is a legacy issue like other legacy issues, is in the discussions that are happening now at a national level between all the stakeholders forming part of this discussion and the solution ultimately for the national problem.

I hear what Mr McGrath is saying about 800-odd other DPIs throughout the country and 25 within Tipperary.  It is quite scary that this issue has taken the time, not to mention the cost of coming here, it has to try to be resolved.  I am conscious Mr. Coskeran is in the Gallery, and I was not able to interact with him when he was a witness before this committee, but I really shudder to think why this is happening.  It is bureaucracy gone mad if it is taking 20 years.  I do not lay the blame fully at Tipperary County Council's door, but from 2003 up to 2014, with the establishment of Irish Water, that was a period when the issue was with Tipperary County Council.  Following on from that, there was the establishment of Irish Water.  I note what has been said, that there is a report being done and that the council applied for funding in 2019, three years ago.  I am not sure when the report is to be done.  Mr. McGrath might be able to clarify that with the Department.  Surely, however, he as chief executive has to agree with me that this is not acceptable and that this has taken an inordinate amount of time.  I am conscious that the five houses in Rocksprings we are speaking about are on the hook for the cost of resolution of any issue with infrastructure that would arise in the short to medium term.  That is an extreme worry for people.  Like Deputy Buckley and Senator Murphy and others, I would regularly deal with requests for taking in charge but rarely have I seen the buck being passed from one organisation to the next and everybody saying it is someone's fault or someone else's issue or we are waiting on this report or that investigation and this site meeting.

They cannot all come before the Oireachtas for negotiation.  I hope that a streamlined process can be put in place between Irish Water and all of the local authorities to which the 800-odd DPIs relate.

I also imagine that it is a distraction in the context of the other work the council needs to be doing <i>vis-&agrave;-vis<\/i>housing, etc.  In the absence of a timeframe, we could easily be here in six or 12 months' time and the matter would not have progressed any further.  I acknowledge Mr. McGrath's comprehensive and transparent statement and his willingness and eagerness to resolve the issue.

Has the council got a commitment from the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage and Irish Water to meet and discuss this issue?  If so, has a date been set for such a meeting?  I am just trying to get an idea of the timeframe, because I am conscious of all the families in these estates.  We might be able to get an answer and then be able to tell these people, even though it might not be the answer they want, that there might be movement on this issue next March.

I am assistant secretary of the Department of Social Protection with responsibility for working age income supports.  I am joined by my colleague, Mr. Ciar&aacute;n Lawler, assistant secretary with responsibility for financial matters, legislation and pensions.  We have been invited for the purposes of a discussion on the recommendations of the citizens&rsquo; assembly regarding care and social protection, namely, recommendations 4 to 12 and 13 to 19.<\/p> <p>  Recommendation 4 aims to improve the terms and conditions of those in paid employment as carers for children and adults.  The Department of Social Protection does not have a role regarding the terms and conditions of those in paid employment as carers.  This is a matter either for the Department of Health, where the HSE is the employer or where it contracts for services, or for the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment in respect of terms and conditions of workers more generally.  However, in relation to recommendation 5 regarding carer's allowance, we are the lead Department.<\/p> <p>  The current basic rate for carer's allowance is &euro;224 per week.  As part of budget 2023, this will increase by &euro;12 per week from January.  Recipients of carer's allowance will also benefit from the double-week payments made last week and due again in December and, along with other carers, from the payment of a cost-of-living lump sum of &euro;500.  As members will be aware, the basic rate of carer's allowance is means-tested subject to an income disregard.  The citizens&rsquo; assembly recommended an increase in the disregard for carers and this was implemented in budget 2022.  The general weekly income disregard for carer's allowance was increased by &euro;17.50 for a single person from &euro;332.50 to &euro;350, and increased by &euro;85 for a couple, from &euro;665 to &euro;750.  These are the highest disregards in the social welfare system and mean, in the case of a couple, that earnings of up to &euro;39,000 a year are disregarded.  Changes were also made to the capital disregard.  <\/p> <p>  It is acknowledged that the ultimate beneficiary of carer&rsquo;s allowance is the person who receives care, with carer&rsquo;s allowance being paid as an income support to assist a carer to provide the necessary hours of care.  However, in acknowledging this fact, it is also recognised that there needs to be a reasonable balance between meeting the requirement for providing full-time care to the care recipient and the benefit to the carer from engaging in employment, training or education.  Accordingly, while it is a condition of receipt of carer&rsquo;s allowance that the carer must be providing full-time care and attention, with full-time being defined as not less than 35 hours per week, provision is also made to allow carers to work, train or study.  In response to calls from carer organisations, the hours those in receipt of carer&rsquo;s allowance can work, train or study was increased in 2020 from 15 hours to 18.5 hours per week.  Our Department also provides a range of training and employment supports to carers, including the introduction of new measures under the Dormant Accounts Fund to support carers.<\/p> <p>  Recommendation 6 relates to an individualised pension solution for carers.  As members will be aware, the contributory State pension system recognises caring periods of up to 20 years outside of paid employment.  PRSI credits, homemaking disregards and home caring periods are used when calculating the pension rate of payment.  Last month, the Government announced its response to the recommendations of the Commission on Pensions, which included the development of a scheme to ensure long-term carers can be attributed with contributions for gaps in their record arising from time spent caring.  This scheme will be developed over the coming months and implemented from January 2024.<\/p> <p>  Recommendation 7 relates to the carer&rsquo;s support grant and the provisions of respite services.  I should clarify for the committee that respite services are not within the remit of the Department of Social Protection.  However, in terms of the carer&rsquo;s support grant, this was increased by &euro;150 to &euro;1,850 in 2021 and is now at its highest rate ever.  Importantly, this grant is not means-tested and is not limited to carers receiving a social welfare payment.<\/p> <p>  Recommendation 8 relates to childcare matters that fall under the remit of the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.  That Department is also responsible for the issues regarding statutory leave for parents, including the terms under which this leave is available and its duration.  When the current durations of maternity, paternity and parent&rsquo;s leave are combined, this adds to 42 weeks of paid leave for a two-parent family.  This will increase to 46 weeks by August 2024.  The role played by the Department of Social Protection is the payment of the associated social welfare benefits in the form of maternity, paternity and parent&rsquo;s benefit.  The rate of working age payments will increase by &euro;12 per week from January as part of measures to support working families in budget 2023.  This will increase the rate of maternity benefit, paternity benefit and parent&rsquo;s benefit to &euro;262 per week.<\/p> <p>  Recommendations 10 to 12 relate to a range of measures regarding the care of older people with disabilities.  While the matters identified within the report do not fall within my Department&rsquo;s direct responsibility, it does have an important role in providing income and employment supports and we are happy to discuss those further with members. <\/p> <p>  Recommendation 13 relates to individualisation.  This is a core design question for the social welfare system, which has been explored in key recent analysis, including from the National Economic and Social Council, NESC.  This is a complex issue with wider implications across the social welfare system and we are happy to explore those further with the committee.<\/p><p>Recommendation 14 relates to the level of social protection payments.  As for State pensions, the Government recently announced that a benchmarked and indexed rate of State pension payments will be introduced as an input to the annual budget process and will be submitted to Government by our Department each year.  This process will begin next year.  The Department, as outlined in the roadmap for social inclusion, has also committed to preparing a report for Government on the potential application of the benchmarking approach to other social welfare payments.  Now that the Government has approved an approach in relation to pension payments, this process can begin.<\/p><p> This recommendation also addresses the issue of staff training.  This is an important priority for our Department.  Our staff learning and development encompasses relevant training in relation to dignity and respect.  This is delivered both directly and through accredited learning programmes with the National College of Ireland and OneLearning, which is the Civil Service shared service.<\/p><p> Recommendation 15 relates to a universal basic income.  The work in Government on this issue is led by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment with the Low Pay Commission.  There is also a basic income pilot in relation to artists under the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media.<\/p><p> On recommendation 16, our Department provides a range of supports to lone parents to assist with training and employment.  However, the childcare issues are not under our responsibility.<\/p><p> Recommendations 17, 18 and 19 relate to a range of pension matters.  The State pension system currently gives significant recognition to those whose work history includes an extended period of time outside the paid workplace, often to raise families or in a full-time caring role.  As outlined earlier, this is done through the award of PRSI credits, the application of the homemaker's scheme and the application of home care periods.  Since April 2019, contributory State pension applications are assessed under all possible methods with the most beneficial payment rate paid to the applicant.  The Commission on Pensions estimated that a universal State pension would cost somewhere in the region of &euro;2 billion to &euro;3 billion per year.  Implementation of a pension automatic enrolment system is well under way, with a project team in the Department of Social Protection progressing a range of elements in an overall plan.  This work includes the drafting of a Bill to establish the automatic enrolment system on a statutory basis, with a view to introducing this draft Bill into the Oireachtas in early 2023.<\/p><p> I thank the committee for the opportunity to appear before it today.

In response to it, the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, referred to this committee as having a role in considering the issues under consideration.  The officials may not be aware.  My colleagues might like to ask the officials about clarifying what the Minister meant by referring a Bill to this committee.  Clearly, we cannot consider a Bill.  We do not have that role and we have a time-limited function in considering just the recommendations of the citizens' assembly.  The substance of the Bill, which seeks to provide protection for cohabitees where sadly, one cohabiting partner dies, does come within some of the social protection recommendations.

This committee has submitted an interim report - and we are familiar with that - and is due to submit a final report.  I am aware that the committee has discussed this issue quite extensively over a number of months.

As the Chair has said, we are a time-based committee and this is our last public session.  The committee has been very fortunate to have had some very interesting conversations with various different Ministers and Departments.  A discussion on social protection is a good way to end the public sessions.  I will focus on two specific areas in the first round of questions.  Reference was made in the opening statement to the education supports that are available.  In our previous public hearings we heard quite strongly from those in the education sector that in some ways, the lack of gender equality is a huge barrier when it comes to career progression.  We heard from younger members who came in to speak with us that what is almost pigeon-holing of students, right back to second level schooling, has had a real impact on their careers as they go forward.  From the Department's perspective, I want to focus on those education barriers.<\/p> <p>  In September, the Minister announced a fund of &euro;2 million to support and improve employment opportunities for family carers.  In relation to those education barriers, can the officials give us an idea of the training and employment supports that are available?  How does the Department measure and quantify the success of these training programmes?  How does the Department of Social Protection interact with the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science to ensure that the training available is actually what is reflected by the demand, both from the user of the training and also from the potential employer of a person coming through those employment and training programmes?<\/p> <p>  Reference was made in the opening statement to some other important issues.  I want to focus on the cost of disability research project that was carried out.  Has the Department conducted a budgetary exercise on the implementation of the outcome of that research project?  We had heard from the Disability Federation of Ireland, Independent Living Movement Ireland, Disabled Women Ireland, and a vast array of representatives.  It also came through very strongly in the citizens' assembly report that those who have a disability should be adequately supported and resourced to live independently for the duration of their lives, and the move by someone under the age of 18 to being a person over the age of 18 should be seamless: the disability does not go when a person's birthday falls and his or her age changes.  What work has the Department of Social Protection carried out to ensure these clear and consistent pathways throughout the lifetime of somebody with a disability?  I also want to hear about the personal assistant services.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GES2022102700002#E00500","speaker":"1495"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666825200,"counter":1068,"content":"<p>Looking first at the educational supports, I will speak to two main cohorts and if I have not covered anything then please let me know.  Deputy Clarke referred to carers.  We have a budget under the Dormant Accounts Fund, which is primarily spent with two main groups, namely, Family Carers Ireland and Care Alliance Ireland.  We have met them to discuss their projects and to engage with carers, many of whom have been out of the workplace for quite some time.  First, it is about identifying where people are at in their lives and identifying what they are looking at preparing for.  There is no job-seeking obligation on them.  It is not our initiative to try to move them into work but there is definitely an appetite in that regard among carers, for financial reasons and for their sense of themselves and their sense of independence, and for keeping in touch.  We have had some good progress with those groups.  Originally under that measure we had focused on disabilities for a number of years.  In response, the carers' groups had come to us and told us they felt that they could make a difference in that space and particularly for younger carers who are often forgotten about.  We ran a programme, we got the responses, and those projects are going very well.  We received some feedback as part of an annual carers' forum.  Zoe Hughes and some of the other people who ran some of the projects gave us some good feedback.  There are a lot of issues coming out of that, some of which are around training deficits, some are around people being unsure of their own worth or attractiveness, and there is definitely a confidence issue when people re-engage.<\/p><p>Some of it is about building up people's confidence and appetite.  In terms of lone parents, it depends on the payment a person is on.  If a person is on the one-parent family payment, there is not necessarily an obligation to engage, but there are training supports when the youngest child is over seven and a person goes onto the jobseeker's transition payment.<\/p><p> We are doing a pilot project at the moment in the north east, from our Dundalk office.  It is a collaboration with One Family.  There are parallel projects being done in Finland and Greece.  It is about experimenting with what works.  We are open to ideas.  It is difficult when there are cohorts that have family requirements and people trying to do blended work.  We know from internal analysis we have done on what type of supports lone parents need that a significant number are working.  Half of the people on the working family payment, for example, are lone parents, and many of the people on the jobseeker's transition payment are working.  We contacted people and said we would like to talk to them about employment opportunities and they asked us if they had to take a day off work to do that as they were already working.  We have formal supports in terms of the education system.  For example, people can get the back-to-education allowance, which means they can keep a proportion of the payment for two years when they go back to education.  Likewise, for people who start their own business, we have a parallel scheme called the back-to-work enterprise allowance.  Other than that, it is about working with a case officer signposting SOLAS or other training and educational opportunities, assessing people's CVs and their experience and trying to connect them with the opportunities.  It is an area where we are trying a few things, usually in partnership with a stakeholder or NGO group that works closely with these communities.  That is how we work it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GES2022102700002#E00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. R&oacute;n&aacute;n Hession","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1666825200,"counter":1070,"content":"<p>I am aware there is a midlands regional task force on which the Department has a representative who attends, in conjunction with local industries across that geographic area.

We have an employer relations unit in the Department, which we have been building for some years.  The vast bulk of employers are small employers.  We ask them to tell us about the people they need and we assure them we will put good people in front of them.  We also run interview campaigns.  We use our offices for the interviews.  We reach out to people who are on the live register or other payments to make them aware there is an opportunity coming up.  I used to work in this area a couple of years ago.

When we have relationships with employers and we run a recruitment campaign, we try to track how many people are recruited, how many stay on and so on, but it is trickier.

It is the biggest survey of its kind ever done in Ireland.  It surveyed not just people on our schemes but also disabled people throughout the country to establish the cost of disability.  The cost ranges enormously depending on the level and type of disability.  Many people with disabilities have more than one disability.<\/p> <p>  A number of recommendations came out of the report.  The first is that there is a significant cost of disability, which ranges from approximately &euro;9,000 to &euro;12,000.  The way to address it requires a mixed approach - income supports, grants and services.  Social welfare is part of it, but it is not the only element.<\/p> <p>  Another point that emerged is that there is very low participation in employment for disabled people in Ireland, not just compared with non-disabled people but also compared with disabled people in other countries.  Addressing all of those results together, a few issues emerge.  The report was referred to the national disability inclusion strategy group, which is a cross-government group that is chaired by the Minister of State, Deputy Anne Rabbitte, who has responsibility for disabilities.  It covers issues such as housing, health, children, education and social welfare and pulls them all together.  The Minister of State has already outlined that she will bring forward reform proposals to try to respond to the cost of disability.  We got money in the budget to reform the reasonable accommodation fund.  That is the money a person gets if he or she starts work to provide adaptive equipment or support needed for employment.  It can go to either the employee or the employer.  There is also a review of the wage subsidy scheme, which is the subsidy employers get to recruit disabled people.<\/p> <p>  A question was also asked about the level of engagement with younger people.  Because the disability allowance payment starts at 16, people go onto the payment quite young - younger than we can engage with them - as, by and large, they are still in the secondary school system.  We have started an early engagement process, which is being piloted in five locations around the country.  We are writing to people in the 18 to 22 years bracket.  We have been very sensitive with the language and we have tested it.  We have an internal consultative group of disability stakeholders with whom we tested the language.  We are saying we are not just here for the purposes of payment but that we also provide employment and educational supports and we are available to have a conversation.  We have run events.  We had a very good event in Tullamore just before the pandemic, with a surprisingly strong turnout.  Many people said it was the first time anyone has taken an interest in them.  From the social welfare point of view, it is a mix of looking at the employer side, the level of payment and the supports back to employment.  With early engagement, we hope we will nudge it on, but I think it is a long game.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GES2022102700002#F00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. R&oacute;n&aacute;n Hession"},{"type":"speech","time":1666825200,"counter":1076,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Hession.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GES2022102700002#F00800","speaker":"1495"},{"type":"speech","time":1666825200,"counter":1077,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Hession for the very full response.

I do not mean it in that way.<\/p> <p>  Social Justice Ireland has expressed its disappointment that increases in social welfare in recent years were non-existent and this year's increase did not bring people above the poverty line.<\/p><p>We have had several engagements on this issue.  Poverty costs people a fortune.  They cannot afford, for example, to get the good uniforms out of which their children would get a few years of use.  They must buy cheaper clothes that go to rags.  I am a member of the climate committee, at which we have talked, in the context of poverty, about prepay meters, which mean people are paying a premium for electricity, whereas the provider suffers no risk.  Those customers should be getting a discount.  It seems everything is stacked against people who are below the poverty line.  These issues affect one-parent families, people with disabilities, those with long-term illnesses and carers, whom we are discussing today, in particular.<\/p><p> I cannot ask the Minister for her view because she is not here.

We look at research from the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, figures from the Central Statistics Office, CSO, and research from the Vincentian Partnership for Social Justice on the minimum essential standard of living.  All of that is fed into the decision-making process in the annual budget.  There are choices to be made.  There is no doubt about that.  There are across-the-board rate increases, which are very costly, and then there are targeted measures for specific groups of people, namely, those who are at higher risk of poverty.  This year was slightly different in terms of the budget because a lot of one-off lump sum payments will be made in the current year, including two double-payment weeks and a lump sum payment to carers, people with disabilities and those on the working family payment and the living alone allowance.  It is slightly different this year and the decision in that regard was taken to address the current cost-of-living crisis.<\/p> <p>  On benchmarking, I was involved in a group more than 20 years ago, the social welfare benchmarking and indexation group, that looked at this issue and made certain recommendations.  It was a social partnership group.  I have been involved in the issue from a policy perspective on and off for the past 20 years.  One big step that has been taken recently is the response to the report of the Commission on Pensions.  The commission recommended a benchmarking and indexation approach for State pensions.  That was a commitment in the roadmap for social inclusion and previously in the roadmap for pensions reform.  From next year, the Department will be preparing a statement for the Government on how that will be implemented and what the figure will be.  The way it will work is that a benchmark will be set of 34% of earnings.  We will look at that and what value it gives, we will look at inflation and what that would give and then we will produce a figure that represents the rate at which the benching should be.  It might sound simple and small but it is a huge step in terms of what the Deputy is talking about in regard to benchmarking and indexation evidence using particular indicators.  It has been a long time coming but it is a big step forward.<\/p> <p>  We also have a commitment in the roadmap for social inclusion to look at a process for working-age payments, which will be far more complex.

While benchmarking and indexation of the State pension would be welcome, the concern relates to who will get the full pension.  Changes were made to the State pension system in 2012.  As of a couple of years ago, two thirds of those receiving the full contributory pension were men, with women making up only one third of the total.  Women are far more likely to be on a lower tier of payment, that is, a reduced-rate or partial pension.  If the benchmarking and indexation around what is essential to live on ends up setting the rate of the full State pension, everybody who is on a reduced rate will be below that level and on a lower payment.<\/p> <p>  From a gender equality perspective, I am concerned that some of the other policies the Government is pursuing may push more women below that level.  The changes made in 2012 in terms of the contributory requirement saw a net loss for more women than men in weekly and monthly pension payments.  Will the witnesses clarify that?  It changed the tiers and levels for the reduced rate, which meant a number of women dropped a level or two within that reduced rate.  While the State pension was not cut as part of austerity measures, the payment for those on the reduced rate was, in effect, cut.  I am raising this in the context of being very concerned by the narrative and proposals we are seeing.  We had the move from a ten-year to a 20-year requirement for the pension.  It was anticipated that we might see a move to a 30-year contributory requirement.  The talk we are hearing now is of seeing that go further.<\/p><p>The normal working life is referenced in one of the Government's responses to the Commission on Pensions as potentially being something like 40 years.  In that context, it would seem we are going to see a huge drop-off.  One question concerns the full State pension versus the reduced rate pension, and maybe the Department has the up-to-date figures on how many women versus men are on the reduced rate or has a gender analysis of how that might happen for a 30-year change and a 40-year change.<\/p><p> The reason I am interested in the 40-year and 30-year piece is that there was mention of the recognition of care credits going up to 20 years, but there are a couple of points in that regard.  One is that it used to be that ten years was enough for a pension and it was then 20 years, and when it went up from 20 years, the goalposts went out to 30 years on the new scheme that was brought in.  We are recognising ten extra years of care credits but the goalposts people have to reach to get a full pension move further away.  Again, it would seem that in the total contributory approach, it will be moving further away to 30 years or 40 years.  Indeed, the fact that, as I understand it, there is a cap of only 20 years of credits in respect of care means that in terms of the contributory pension, if people have just cared and if they do not have ten years of employment, they will be on a reduced rate, and if it moved to a 40-year threshold and they only had care credits, they would be on a half pension.<\/p><p> I say that in a context that relates to the other issue.  The witnesses will be aware that the citizens&rsquo; assembly looked for a universal pension and it has also looked for individualisation in regard to pensions.  This is because, of course, for women predominantly, although not solely, who have been the carers in a household, they will not necessarily qualify for the non-contributory pension if their partner fails the means test.  Therefore, in terms of having an individual independent source of income in later years, it is not guaranteed in that context.<\/p><p> The witnesses might comment on the individualisation issue, which is important in terms of finances, and also around the issue of the gender proofing of these potential impacts at 30 and 40 years.

I will start where she finished, on the 2012 changes.  The Senator is correct that in the plans that were introduced in 2012, there were more bands and this reduced the rate of pension that might have been payable to people who were assessed under the career averaging rule, as it was called at the time.  Since then, an interim total contributions approach has been introduced so people who have reached pension age from 2012 onwards will get the rate of pension that is the best of the averaging approach or the total contributions approach.<\/p> <p>  I am not sure if the Senator has the up-to-date figures but we are beginning to see some positive results from that approach.  If we go back to 2018, just over 37% of women qualified for the maximum rate.  In 2019 that increased to over 47%, in 2020 it was over 48% and it was over 49%, or almost half, last year.  It is still not at the same rate as for men and the proportion of men who qualify is about 63%, but it is certainly going in the right direction.  That may be a combination of the total contributions approach, with the 20 years of home caring credits.

It is not a social welfare benefit.  It is a pilot scheme being run in the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media.  That is to recognise the precarious and oscillating nature of income in the arts.  It is a pilot of 2,000 or 3,000 people that will run for three years and that is the payment rate that was recommended at the time by the task force, on which I sat, to be pitched at the equivalent of the full-time minimum wage with people working a 32-hour week, which is, on average, what people work.<br\/><br\/>The carer's payment is a social welfare payment, so there is a different basis for it.  Social welfare payments are essentially for where a particular contingency arises.  If, for example, a person cannot work because he or she is carer, has a disability that restricts his or her ability to work, is unemployed or is a lone parent, the State will step in and provide a basic level of payment.  The carer's allowance is currently &euro;224.  The base line of social welfare is &euro;208, so it is slightly above the base line rate.<br\/><br\/>In terms of a universal income or basic income, however, the way that is being looked at is that there is a report that is being or has been done, as I understand it, by the Low Pay Commission based on Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, analysis.  That is with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and is being looked at by the T&aacute;naiste's officials.  It is not a social welfare issue <i>per se<\/i>.

This is not a feature of the pilot that is being run, but it is in the task force report and it is worth looking at.  Basic income is basically an alternative model to our current system.  Our current system works on a basis of social welfare payments and tax reliefs.  Usually, the concept of a basic income is that a person does not have social welfare payments or tax reliefs.  All his or her income is fully taxed and, instead, a person gets a basic income alongside that.  There will be winners and losers in that.  A basic income, as a concept, is a big departure from our current system.  It is something that has been tried internationally in targeted ways.  A basic income, as such, is not something we have looked at from a social welfare perspective.  We looked at it from the point of view of income support and carer's allowance.  It is means tested.  We do not have enough money to pay everybody so we target it based on assessment of income.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GES2022102700002#J00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. R&oacute;n&aacute;n Hession"},{"type":"speech","time":1666825200,"counter":1121,"content":"<p>Will Mr. Hession go into a bit more detail about the winners and losers?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GES2022102700002#J00800","speaker":"1585"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666825200,"counter":1122,"content":"<p>What I mean by that is that, in a basic income, a person loses his or her tax credits.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GES2022102700002#J00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. R&oacute;n&aacute;n Hession"},{"type":"speech","time":1666825200,"counter":1123,"content":"<p>There would be no means tests, however.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GES2022102700002#J01000","speaker":"1585"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666825200,"counter":1124,"content":"<p>Basic income means everyone would get it.

This committee has heard from different groups, and it is what they hear from those with whom they work, that the level at which the payment is currently set - I know it increased to &euro;262 per week in the budget - is actually a barrier to men availing of paternity leave.  Primarily, if we also take into consideration that the mother of the child may not be having her own wages topped up by the employer, it reduces the family income significantly at a time when their costs are actually increasing with a new addition to the household.  Has any work been undertaken to date around potentially linking the paternity leave payment to earned income in the previous period?  Does the Department correlate data on the percentage of new parents, both mums and dads, who have their wages topped up by employers?  The people who do not have their wages topped up by employers are other side of the equation.  My understanding is that if it is being topped up, the payment is made directly to the employer and the employer continues to pay the wages.  Does the Department have a percentage breakdown around that?<\/p> <p>  On the payment of child maintenance and the child maintenance service, my understanding is that, for a single parent to qualify for the one-parent family payment, that person must prove he or she has sought maintenance from the other party.  It does not take into account whether that maintenance has actually been paid.  We know single parent households are more likely to experience poverty.  In that regard, what is the Department's anticipated response where the other parent is not fulfilling his or her maintenance obligations?  It would mean the payment of the parent who has custody being reduced by the amount of maintenance he or she is not actually receiving.

The numbers on paternity leave have improved in recent years, which has been good to see, and we also have parent's leave and benefit, so along with the two weeks of paternity leave there is an additional seven weeks of leave that can be taken.<\/p> <p>  On linking it to pay, there is a programme for Government commitment to look at pay related payments in the jobseeker's space.  In other words, jobseeker's benefit would be pay related.  It is already pay related to some extent but not in a meaningful way.  The first area in which we would look at that would be in jobseeker's benefit and there are programme for Government commitments around looking at enhanced payments in other areas for parents as a follow-on from that.<\/p> <p>  On child maintenance, the way it works is that if you are receiving a maintenance payment and it is not being paid in full or it stops, under our current system you are required to make efforts to seek maintenance.  If the maintenance is not received, we can restore payments to the full amount.  That was reviewed by the child maintenance review group, which has completed its work and it reported to the Minister in April.  There are three social welfare issues in that.  First is whether maintenance should be considered in the means test at all.  Second is whether that approach of efforts to seek maintenance through the courts should continue or not.

Considering the idea to have a one-parent family payment, which is around support for the parent, versus things like child benefit that are universal, to use maintenance again would not be right.  We do not use maintenance against child benefit and we should not be using it against a one-parent family payment either.<\/p> <p>  On the one-parent family payment and the jobseeker's transitional payment, it was mentioned that childcare was not an area that was seen as directly relevant to the Department of Social Protection but it is relevant in its intersection with one-parent families in particular.  There is a requirement after receiving jobseeker's transitional payment that when a child is 14 years old, a one-parent family is moved to a payment where there is a requirement for full-time availability for work, yet they have a 14-year-old child and no other parent in play.  Has consideration been given to extending a jobseeker's transitional payment to when a child is 18?  That would allow the jobseeker's transitional payment where there is access to supports such as the pilot scheme for access to employment and where there is not the obligation of full-time availability for employment, which creates a lot of tension and difficulty for those parenting alone in that last four years of a child's childhood.  It is worth noting that we do not have an equivalent measure for couples whereby we may have a spouse who is not working.  There is no full-time obligation for both parents in a married couple to be working in terms of the payment of a social welfare payment plus a qualified adult increase.  It seems that there is an unequal treatment of lone parents in that period of time when their child is between the ages of 14 and 18.  The witnesses might comment on that.<\/p> <p>  The other thing on lone parents is the early childhood care and education, ECCE, scheme.  It was interesting that it was mentioned that half of those on the working family payment are one-parent families.  The working family payment requires you to be working 19 hours whereas the ECCE scheme gives families 15 hours of childcare.  There is always that gap between the 15 hours and the 19 hours and I wonder if that is something on which the Department has engaged with the reform of childcare process to look to how that gap between the 15 hours of childcare available and the 19-hour work requirement to get the working family payment might be bridged.<\/p> <p>  On leave, the witnesses will be aware that one of the specific recommendations from the citizens' assembly was to ensure that the same full year of effective paid leave would happen in respect of a one-parent family.  It is good to have the targeted supports which, as Deputy Clarke said, should be improved for men or partners in paternity leave, but where there is only one parent it should be ensured that from the child's perspective, the same amount of leave is given to their parental unit in total.  Measures to bridge that should be introduced.<\/p> <p>  There is strong means testing and it came into the issue with the other Bill we were discussing.  I mention cohabitants.  If you are cohabiting, that is strongly considered in means testing and there can be a problem there in individualisation and individual economic independence.  For example, that is one of the issues that makes it hard for those who are parenting alone to cohabit.  If they are responsible for a child and they cohabit, that person's means may get considered against their receipt of payments.  In general when it comes to financial independence for women, means testing is a serious obstacle.  It was mentioned that individualisation is complex and that it would be good to discuss it further so I would like to provide the opportunity to discuss it further because it seems to be an extremely important issue from a gender perspective.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GES2022102700002#K00500","speaker":"1662"},{"type":"speech","time":1666825200,"counter":1134,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator.

I counted seven areas but I will cover them as best I can.  The Senator can remind me if I have missed anything.<\/p> <p>  On the publication of the child maintenance review group report, I understand the report is with the Minister.  It has been submitted.  This is a very complex area and there are other Departments involved.  It is not purely a social welfare issue.  The consultation has been ongoing but I understand the intention is to publish the document before the end of the year.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the exclusion of maintenance from means, I understand the Senator's point.  It is one of the core issues concerning the review group and will be dealt with in the report.<\/p> <p>  On the requirement to be genuinely seeking work, there were changes made to lone parent payments about ten years ago.  It used to be the case that you did not have to seek work until the child was 18, or 22 if he or she continued in education.  That was changed about ten years ago in response to an analysis of long-term outcomes.  It was found that being out of the workforce for a long time did not result in good outcomes for lone parents.  This is why there was a change to bring about the current two-payment structure, whereby you get the one-parent family payment until your youngest child is seven and go on to a jobseeker's allowance scheme when the child is 14.  The decision was made at the point I have mentioned.  You become subject to the condition requiring you to be genuinely seeking work.  There are no proposals to change that, although we have signalled changes to working-aid payments more generally that may be helpful to lone parents in terms of flexibility.<\/p> <p>  On the point on couples and the requirement to be genuinely seeking work, that there is no obligation regarding the increase for a qualified adult, IQA.  This links to some extent to the Senator's point on individualisation.  What do we mean by individualisation?  Under the current system, we can split a payment between the two members of a couple.  In other words, the money can be split between the two individuals.  With regard to where there is a benefit payment, namely, a payment based on contributions rather than means, generally speaking members of the couple both get a payment in their own right.  <\/p> <p>  The Senator is right that there is no conditionality concerning qualified adults.  If one moved to an individualised system where the qualified adult got a payment in his or her own right, the question would arise as to what that payment should be.  What would the conditionality be?  Should the payment be a jobseeker payment?  In other words, the person would be expected to be genuinely seeking work.  If there are children in the frame, would one apply something more like a jobseeker's transition payment in respect of which there is a level of engagement?  That is actually the model that the NESC recommended for IQAs.  Individualisation can mean different things.  If it is a matter of simply splitting the payment, we can already do that.  It does not happen that often, probably because it does not lead to any extra income for the household.<\/p> <p>  I want to check my understanding of a certain point that the Senator made.  When it comes to individualisation, the first step is to have everyone agree on what we mean by it.  In an earlier reference, on the pension side, I understood the Senator to mean that for a household with one income, which could be substantial enough to mean the other partner would not get through a means test, one would design individualisation in a way that would result in a complete disregard.  Therefore, the other person would be treated as having no means.  That is a possible model of individualisation but in this regard, I note the Commission on Taxation and Welfare has outlined some principles that are worth examining.  There are four or five bullet points on how it would work.  One will still have regard to household income.  We need to consider what the individual gets but also what the household gets.  Ultimately, means testing is to ensure that scarce resources are targeted at those most in need.  Can the system be designed whereby everyone in a household with a high income is assessed separately and the second partner in the household gets his or her own individual payment on a means-tested basis?  Yes, of course.  These are all choices for policymakers.  There may be very good reasons for decisions, including those concerning independence.  As civil servants, our job is to make sure that everyone understands the implications.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GES2022102700002#L00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. R&oacute;n&aacute;n Hession"},{"type":"speech","time":1666825200,"counter":1136,"content":"<p>I suppose that is where the gender analysis comes in.

I absolutely agree that we should be managing our resources more carefully, but that is where gender analysis comes in.  It is a question of financial independence.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GES2022102700002#L00300","speaker":"1662"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666825200,"counter":1137,"content":"<p>To cover some of the Senator's other points, the working family payment works out as 19 hours per week.  Strictly speaking, it is 38 hours per fortnight because people do shifts and spread their working hours.  It is not linked specifically to the ECCE hours.  One of the difficulties in public policymaking is that there are many different schemes that, in an ideal world, would be in lockstep with one another, whether they concern the housing assistance payment, HAP, the medical card scheme or the ECCE programme.  There is dissonance between schemes.  The issue with the working family payment is that it is intended to cover circumstances where a substantial number of hours are worked in the household in the week.  It is a unique payment in the social welfare system.  Essentially, it gives you a percentage of the difference between what you are earning and the threshold.  It is very much linked to the hours you work.  It is not directly linked specifically to childcare.  That is the truth of it.<\/p> <p>  With regard to lone parents' leave, we have quite high levels of leave.  The European Parliament produced a very interesting ready reckoner on the position around the EU.  I have it in front of me; it is a little graphic.  The current average for maternity and paternity leave in the EU is about 14 weeks.  Our figure is higher.  Other countries may have shorter periods but higher rates of payment, so there are all sorts of trade-offs in the blend that is achieved.<\/p> <p>  On the discussion on whether lone parents should get the same overall leave entitlement as couples, there are a couple of things to say.  In this regard, let me refer to the European work&ndash;life balance directive, which is where the parental leave comes from.  I am sorry to be a real civil servant about this, but the leave concerns the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.  We pay the associated benefit.  That said, the directive states you cannot share the leave.  That is a deliberate design feature of the directive to avoid reinforcing the current burden of childcare among couples.  In other words, if the fathers in couples transferred their leave to the mothers, the mothers would take on more and more of the burden.<\/p> <p>  The issue with lone parents from a social welfare perspective is that where someone is on a lone-parent payment, there may still be a second parent in the frame with an entitlement to that leave.  The vast majority of lone parents are female.  Let us assume, for the purpose of illustration, that the lone parent has the parent's leave, which is currently at seven weeks and needs to go to nine weeks by August 2024.  The other parent will also have that entitlement.  With regard to spending time with children and having family involvement, it is not straightforward to say the leave should be transferred to the lone parent.  I know the Senator is not suggesting that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GES2022102700002#L00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. R&oacute;n&aacute;n Hession"},{"type":"speech","time":1666825200,"counter":1138,"content":"<p>I am not necessarily suggesting a transfer; I am actually suggesting that we might need an additional scheme.

Just because a person may have started a relationship with somebody, it does not mean he or she is stepping in <i>in loco parentis<\/i>and can be considered as contributing to the particular financial needs of that household.  There is also the wider test issue, which comes back to the same thing on means testing in respect of cohabiting couples, whose incomes are both considered in terms of whether they are entitled to payment but, as we saw during discussions of the Bill last night, when it comes to receiving payment, the assumption is that both people are contributing equally to the household and that the moneys of each are equally available to each person.  That is an assumption being made about household budgeting, which is not always true.  That assumption is being made at that point but when a household suffers a loss or bereavement, as we saw in respect of the legislation last night, it is no longer recognised as a household in the same sense.

We are seeing more and more people and, to some extent, the eligibility with the means test changes brought some people in and it also is better awareness.  In addition, it shows the extent to which people are taking on a lot more caring responsibility at home.  It is situation where we sort of pick up the social welfare implications afterwards, if you like, in terms of what is driving it.  This is more about people&rsquo;s preference being cared for at home in terms of what the optimum use of the available bed space, residential space, hospital space etc. is and whether caring for people at home can be supported.  We are in the follow-up of that now.  We have the financial supports but if you look over the figures, it is clear that since about 2015, there has been a big jump in carer&rsquo;s allowance, which is nearly a &euro;1 billion payment at this stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GES2022102700002#N00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. R&oacute;n&aacute;n Hession"},{"type":"speech","time":1666825200,"counter":1164,"content":"<p>That is very interesting.

As Senator Doherty said, it would be very useful and important for our committee&rsquo;s work if we had some sense of what the gender analysis process has been on pensions within the Department &ndash; not within the commission &ndash; in terms of its proposals.  Specifically, what modelling has there been around the potential impacts of things such as the automatic enrolment scheme?  The data are there, effectively, to do some analysis of what the likely impact would be.  I share the concern that we might end up with gaps being created.<\/p> <p>  I also wonder whether we could get a detailed analysis around that &euro;2 billion to &euro;3 billion from the Commission on Pensions that was mentioned.  If, specifically, we were to look to those who have a carer&rsquo;s allowance and have been contributing in that way but fall short to be brought to the same threshold of the contributory State pension, what would that particular slice of money do?  That is bridging that 50% of women who will not qualify for the full contributory State pension.  What would specifically addressing that 50% gender gap look like?<\/p> <p>  The witnesses will be aware that there are those who are in a very particular position.  We mentioned the scheme in terms of those who are incapacitated.  We still have older women in the State who were affected by the marriage bar and will not be able to meet the ten-year threshold in that regard.  That is something where a ring-fenced, specific scheme has been called for in the past.  That is a crucial recognition of care and possibly not covered.  Perhaps it will be covered by the new scheme that is coming in terms of incapacitated dependants.  <\/p> <p>  Can the witnesses follow up on the minimum essential standards of living?  As I noted earlier, the citizens' assembly sought to ensure that people had a level of income that was both above the poverty and deprivation threshold and specifically met particular adequate standards of living.  That was directly in there.  How much work has been done by the Department to make the minimum essential standard of living research available and relevant to the consideration of the potential introduction of a living wage or the adequate minimum wage directive from Europe?<\/p> <p>  That is so much but that is probably enough.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GES2022102700002#N01000","speaker":"1662"},{"type":"speech","time":1666825200,"counter":1170,"content":"<p>We will have the last response.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GES2022102700002#N01100","speaker":"1698"},{"type":"speech","time":1666825200,"counter":1171,"content":"<p>I apologise; I have one last thing on care credits that relates to Senator Doherty&rsquo;s comments  There was a problem where people were not getting credits because they previously did not have a social protection record such as, for example, those who had come home from abroad to care.  Has that been addressed?  Are those people getting captured in terms of PRSI stamps at the moment?<\/p> <p>  Are those who do not qualify for the carer&rsquo;s allowance or other payments based on means testing always nonetheless included into the system for the purposes of care credits?  I worry sometimes that those who fail to get a payment may fall out of the system in terms of their crucial future contributory pension.  What mechanisms does the Department have to avoid those particular gaps?<\/p> <p>  Finally, something for which I have pushed for years is that as well as care being recognised in one&rsquo;s pension, care becomes a contributory allowance.  For example, if a person has been caring for a period of ten years, that person has care credits in the system and could therefore access an Intreo scheme, back to education scheme or other schemes.  At the moment, effectively, if a person is not on carer&rsquo;s allowance, has been out of the social protection system and has not been getting a payment for a period of five or ten years - a position in which many qualified adults end up - that person is not individually visible to the system.  If these people want to move back into the workplace, they do not have the one or two years in the system that would allow them to access voluntary schemes that might support them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GES2022102700002#N01200","speaker":"1662"},{"type":"speech","time":1666825200,"counter":1172,"content":"<p>We will leave the questioning there and come back to our witnesses.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GES2022102700002#N01300","speaker":"1698"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666825200,"counter":1173,"content":"<p>I will start on the credits issue that the Senator mentioned.  Certainly, people on carer&rsquo;s allowance and carer&rsquo;s benefit get social insurance credits.  However, that is contingent on them having a paid contribution within the two years prior to going on that scheme, so the Senator is correct there.  When it comes to home caring periods and how they are counted for pension purposes, they are not actual social insurance credits and that is why it has the name that it does.  They are periods that have the same effect as having a credit; it is not contingent on a person being on a payment or getting credit on a payment for those purposes.<\/p> <p>  On the minimum essential standard of living, my understanding &ndash; I am open to correction on this &ndash; is that the research had direct input in the discussions on living wage.  Certainly, as the Senator knows, this Department funds that research.  It is now housed as a research centre in the Society of St. Vincent De Paul.  It has been hugely influential in some of the budgetary changes and policies that have been introduced.  For example, the higher payment for kids over the age of 12 years came directly from that research.<\/p><p>Even though it has moved from the Vincentian Partnership for Social Justice it is great that work is continuing into the future.<\/p><p> We can certainly look at the universal pension and try to get a figure for that slice Senator Higgins mentioned, which was uprating to the full rate women who are on the reduced rate.  It would also be necessary to include, and I do not know if we have these figure but no doubt we can find them, women who do not have a pension at all.

That is a gap that needs to be addressed.<\/p> <p>  In regard to the other issue, sometimes it is not necessarily those who are on carer's allowance or carer's benefit, for example, qualified adults who may be caring for children at home.  They are registered as qualified adults on their partners' payments or wages but they are not necessarily accruing credits in their own names.  When their children reach a certain age, those people may try voluntarily to seek access to schemes such as Intreo or back to education.  There are many situations where somebody who has been a qualified adult but who has not been visible in the system individually wants to access measures such as back to education or other positive and very good schemes that are available.  However, for most of those schemes it is necessary to have been registered as a jobseeker for a certain period of time or it is necessary to have been in the system.  The system at the moment only looks at the past two years, and if a person has not been working or no individual stamps have been paid on his or her behalf, he or she is quite invisible.

As they requested, I have prepared a brief opening statement, which I will read.  I will then be pleased to respond to questions.  As the Chairman noted, it was 24 years ago that the people of Northern Ireland changed the course of their history.  They worked for, voted for and established a democratic and peaceful process as their preferred form of governance.  They rejected violence as a way to resolve their political differences.  They had the strong support of the people of Ireland, who also voted overwhelmingly for the agreement, and the support of the eight political parties in Northern Ireland who negotiated the agreement along with the governments of Ireland and the UK.  On the evening the agreement was reached, I commented on and commended the men and women who negotiated and signed the agreement.  In the most difficult and dangerous of circumstances, they acted with courage, strength and vision.  However, I also said that evening that it would take other leaders in the future to safeguard and extend their work.<\/p> <p>  Today, nearly a quarter of a century later, the people of Northern Ireland continue to wrestle with their doubts, differences and disagreements.  That is, and should not be, a surprise.  No society is free of differences and disagreements but unlike in the times prior to the agreement, they are trying to resolve their differences through democratic and peaceful means, not through violence.  Imperfectly to be sure, it involves slowly trying to work forward with occasional steps backwards but with the support of the governments and people of Ireland, the UK and people of good will all around the world, they must be encouraged to resolve their differences peacefully.  The solutions will not be perfection or permanence so it is for the current leadership in Northern Ireland, Ireland and the UK to find practical and workable solutions and answers to their current problems and preserve the peace, freedom and opportunity for their people.  <\/p> <p>  From 1995 through 1999, I had the privilege of serving in Northern Ireland.  I am often asked about what about those years is most important to me.  My answer is in the following numbers: between 1968 and 1998 in Northern Ireland during what had come to be known as the Troubles, approximately 3,500 people were killed and an estimated 50,000 were injured and between 1998 and the present, there have been approximately 160 security-related deaths.  I believe that latter figure includes the 30 people killed in a single tragic bombing in Omagh in August 1998.  <\/p> <p>  With enormous patience and skill over several years and under several different governments, Ireland and the UK played crucial roles in establishing the process that led to the talks and ultimately to agreement.  Ireland is now directly engaged in that continuing effort and for that, I commend it.  I wish politicians here and their counterparts in Northern Ireland and the UK the best of success.  <\/p> <p>  In conclusion, I will make some personal comments.  I am sorry that I cannot be with the committee today in Dublin.  As members may know, approximately two years ago, I was diagnosed with acute leukemia.  Since then, I have been treated with chemotherapy in hospitals and now as an outpatient.  As a result, my ability to function, travel and appear at public events has been severely limited and I have suffered some decline in memory and hearing.  However, what has happened and what will happen in Northern Ireland means a great deal to me so I am very grateful to the Chairman and the members of the committee for letting me participate in this way.  I am now pleased to respond to all their questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2022102700002#E00300","nonspeaker":"Senator George Mitchell"},{"type":"speech","time":1666825200,"counter":1192,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Mitchell for his address - inspiring as always.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2022102700002#E00400","speaker":"1598"},{"type":"speech","time":1666825200,"counter":1193,"content":"<p>The Senator is very welcome.

The two prime ministers and President Clinton called and asked me if I would return to Northern Ireland to try to put the process back on track.<\/p><p>I did and I spent several months there.  The negotiations at the time were narrow, involving primarily the Ulster Unionist Party and Sinn F&eacute;in.  For several weeks we struggled to make progress without much success and then someone made a suggestion - it may have been David Trimble, Gerry Adams or both.  They said to me that it was very difficult for them and their party members.  As some members may recall, the meetings took place in a government office building in Stormont and there was a fence surrounding the building with a single entrance through a gate.  The media tended to congregate just outside the gate and to understandably pepper those arriving in the morning and going out in the evening with questions, challenges and comments.<\/p><p> It was creating difficulties in the discussions.  It was an issue, as it was during the main talks themselves, trying to balance two valid objectives in a democratic society - freedom of the press and the right of the public to know, which is a valid objective of course, on the one hand, and the necessity for some discussions to take place completely in private on the other, as otherwise it would be impossible to reach agreement on controversial and contested issues such as those before us.<\/p><p> They asked that I consider convening a series of meetings outside Stormont.

I was able to establish some degree of communication between members of the two parties who had previously not communicated very well.  We ultimately returned to Belfast and were able to complete a process of putting the agreement back on track.  As I said, it was a one-off situation which worked in that instance.  It is impossible to say to what degree the isolation helped.  However, I think it helped somewhat and contributed to putting the process back together.

Most of all there was a tremendous fear throughout society of a further outbreak of violence which would have likely been more destructive.  The whole history of human beings, of course, is of continual increase in the capacity of humans to kill one another.  Now a relatively small number of people, one person, can with modern technology wreak tremendous injury and harm.<\/p> <p>  Ultimately through that, the political leaders of Northern Ireland, Ireland and the UK were able to come together.  To me it was an example of the best that human beings are capable of.  I came away with and I retain a tremendous admiration for the men and women who reached that agreement.  They were ordinary people just like the Deputy and me.  They had spent their entire lives in conflict.  Many of them had been shot at.  Some had been shot.  Many had been in prison for violent crimes but they were determined not to return to that.  As a result, they demonstrated what could be done.

It must be internal, organic and created by those directly involved as was the case in 1998.<\/p><p>I recall how on the first day of the main negotiations, which ultimately lasted nearly two years, I told the delegates that I did not come with an American plan.  There was no external plan.  If an agreement could be reached, and I said I believed this was possible, it would have to be their agreement.  It had to be the agreement of the people who were going to be affected by it and live under it.  Two years later, on the morning of 10 April, when I presented the final plan to them after tremendously intensive negotiations over the prior two weeks involving the two Prime Ministers and all of the delegates from the eight political parties, I repeated orally what I had said two years earlier.  I said \"this agreement is your agreement\".  Every single word in it was written or spoken by someone from Northern Ireland.  I encouraged them to approve it, which they ultimately did.<\/p><p> It takes a long time to achieve reconciliation.  Before I came to Northern Ireland, I was involved to some extent in the conflict in the Balkans.  I recall going to a small town on the border between Croatia and Bosnia that had been devastated in the conflict.  It was about half Serb and half Croat.  The Serbs had the initial military advantage, took over the town and burned down many of the homes and buildings owned by Croats.  A year and a half later, the tide of war changed and the Croats took control and responded in kind.  When I got there, virtually every building in town had been either destroyed or damaged.  The mayor was a young man.  I asked him when he thought Serbs and Croats would again be able to live together in peace.  He thought for a while and said, \"We will rebuild our buildings long before we repair our souls, but that's what important.\"<\/p><p> Repairing the souls of the people, particularly those who suffered direct personal loss of a husband, wife, child or friend, is very hard, painful and long-standing.  I try not to be impatient or critical.  Rather, I try as best I can to be supportive and encouraging.  What I have said to the political leaders in Northern Ireland in the current period - the last time I was there was a few years ago - involved citing the example of their predecessors.  Those in 1998 who were no different from us.  They had been in the conflict.  That was really the only difference in circumstance, although it was a substantial one.  They had been through the conflict, had seen death and destruction and were worried about their family's safety and their personal safety.  That does not exist now.  People tend to forget that.  Their minds move to other things.  For anyone under 25, this all happened before they were born, but we must keep reminding ourselves and them what is at stake and encourage them as best we can to reach agreement.  There is no magic formula I or any external person or force can suggest or impose on them.  It must come from within - from the courage, strength and vision of the current political leaders of Northern Ireland in particular but also Ireland and the UK.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2022102700002#F00800","nonspeaker":"Senator George Mitchell","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1666825200,"counter":1204,"content":"<p>I now call our first Sinn F&eacute;in representative, Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile, a native of Belfast and a Member of our Seanad, but before I do so, I congratulate Ms Gildernew, who I understand is a grandmother.

For one thing, the agreement did not deal with several of the major issues confronting Northern Ireland.  There was no decision on policing and the justice system, which were very important and controversial issues.  We in effect created commissions to deal with them in the future, so it was obvious to everyone that the agreement was a political compromise.  It was imperfect but it was the best that could be achieved at that time.  It did achieve the overriding objective of bringing the violence that accompanied the Troubles to an end, but it did not solve all of the problems that led to the Troubles.  It was apparent to all of the participants that there would be challenges ahead and, of course, that turned out to be true.<\/p> <p>  As I mentioned earlier, in 1999, barely a year after the agreement was reached in Northern Ireland, the Assembly collapsed.  We put it back together again by the end of the year but then it encountered further difficulties.  There followed a series of discussions and negotiations culminating in the St. Andrews talks.  I was not present then - I had nothing to do with it - but I have read about it.  It did restore the First Minister and deputy First Minister and sought to resolve the issue of policing, which was a very important issue that was critical to the society and an emotional issue on all sides.  I do not think I was the only one.  I think everybody involved in the talks recognised that, while the agreement was a great accomplishment, it did not in itself and by itself resolve permanently the difficult issues confronting the people of Northern Ireland, which continue to this day.<\/p> <p>  I want to say one thing to the committee that I have said several times in Northern Ireland - I think the indication was that Senator or one of his members is from Northern Ireland - I love the people of Northern Ireland and I like the place.<\/p><p>The people are energetic and very friendly to those of us from the outside.  They are warm and engaging but if they have a fault, it is that they are too self-critical.  Self-criticism is a good thing but it is a great evil in Northern Ireland that is unwarranted.  I recall the last time I went there was several years ago, in about 2016 or 2017.  I was met by reporters who asked me whether this was terrible what was happening in Northern Ireland what with all of this agreement and unpleasantness.  I said I just flew from the US to London and from London to here.  I said that given what was going on in the United States and the disagreements we had and given what was going on in the UK - Brexit had just occurred - I did not think any American was in a position to lecture anyone else on internal disagreement.  I try to emphasise the positive in dealing with people in and from Northern Ireland and to try to move them away from the negatives that have accumulated over time.<\/p><p> Even if this were magically solved in the coming 60 days and were the Executive to be restored, no one should think that is a perfect, permanent solution.  It would meet the current challenges.  Life has changed for each individual human being, society, government and nation.  It is a truism that in human affairs, the solution to every problem contains within itself the seeds of a new problem.  The challenge for the political leaders in Northern Ireland is to figure out a practical, workable way to get this process back on track, get the Assembly functioning and the First Minister and deputy First Minister in place and deal with the practical day-to-day problems that the people of Northern Ireland have.  They should not worry about creating something that will last for all time and forever.  It will not happen.  It will be challenged again the following year.

There was a widespread fear of an immediate and severe outbreak of violence that had been accelerating over the prior three or four months.  The difficulty of the issues they dealt with resulted in there not being that kind of specifically detailed review.  As it turns out, the periodic reviews that have occurred have been initiated by crisis such as the collapse in 1999 and the further difficulties that have occurred down the line including, most recently, the inability of the Executive to function.  If I were teaching a class on this at some university, I would probably encourage people in similar situations, to the extent possible, to include a more specific and detailed review in order that for all of the issues involved there would be some process for determining progress or suggesting ways forward.  It is not likely it could have been done within the timeframe and pressure of events.<\/p> <p>  I am the one who proposed the deadline, because I was convinced that the process was about to fail and that the violence would occur.  However, having a deadline and a pressure meant that only a certain number of issues could be dealt with and it was extraordinarily difficult as it was.  I see that Ms Hanna is a member of the SDLP.  The SDLP delegation was one of the foundations of the agreement in the negotiations led by John Hume and Seamus Mallon.  The Ulster Unionist Party was the other, of course, led by David Trimble, Reg Empey and others.  They carried a heavy load.  All eight parties contributed tremendously to the process and, indeed, we needed the approval of all eight but it was very difficult.<\/p> <p>  Even though I was physically present throughout, it is hard for me today to recreate the pressure, difficulty and complexity of what they were dealing with at the time.

One of the essential requirements and challenges delegates faced in 1998 was to achieve a power-sharing government.  To do that, you had to identify the powers and that is what it did, particularly through the mechanism of sufficient consensus, which, as Dr. Farry will recall, we adopted during the talks themselves in terms of how to proceed in writing the rules under which the negotiations occurred.  Subsequently, that was put in variant form into the agreement.  That really was the point I made when I said on that evening that there would be challenges for future leaders because I do not think anyone intended the mechanisms used in the agreement to be fixed for all time in Northern Ireland.  There would come a time when it would be decided by the people of Northern Ireland and their political representatives how they would move on to other forms for achieving political consensus than those confronted by the delegates in 1998.<\/p><p>No one can say with absolute assurance how or when that will occur but it is inevitable to occur.  The political structure in Northern Ireland is unique because the situation the delegates confronted was unique.  A solution had to be devised that dealt with those problems and would get through them, it was hoped, and, over a period, adjustments would be made, as needed, to meet the then current challenges of the society.<\/p><p> Dr. Farry pointed out an obvious problem to which I think the answer is obvious, namely, that this is what had to be done at the time to meet the problems the delegates faced when, at some point, there was going to be some change and adjustment in that mechanism.  Some time ago, before an American audience, I was asked the same question, in essence, in a different form.  I said that we have an American constitution of which we are very proud but that, in retrospect, we know has contained many things that may have been appropriate for that time but are not appropriate for this time.  We established a mechanism to amend the constitution and it has been amended dozens of times since then to reflect changing circumstances.

I was active in support of an effort that was led by Baroness May Blood, who, tragically, passed away recently, to encourage integrated education in Northern Ireland.  I strongly favour student exchanges as a way of bringing improvements in both societies, that is, the society that sends and the society that receives.  In fact, there are two scholarship programmes that have been named after me to encourage exchanges between the United States and Ireland, both the Republic and Northern Ireland, for both graduate students and community college students.  Such exchanges are of benefit, as I said, to both societies.<\/p> <p>  Ms Gildernew's question, although she did not ask it specifically, points up the importance of maintaining an open border.  I cannot tell the committee how surprised I was when I first went to Northern Ireland to meet with people on both sides of the Border who lived relatively close to it but had never crossed it and whose impressions of the other society were rooted in circumstances that may have existed 50 years earlier but no longer obtained.  Exchanges of people, particularly of students, are especially important.<\/p> <p>  I have also been involved in programmes that actively solicit to bring children from both communities to the United States during their summer vacations.  The programme started in dealing with Israeli and Palestinian students and was expanded to include youngsters from both communities in Northern Ireland.  I think it is an invaluable tool in trying to garner understanding and to benefit both the individuals themselves and the society as a whole on both sides.  I commend Ms Gildernew on that and I encourage it very strongly.  It is a truism and a clich&eacute; but young people are the future of the society and upon them will rest decisions that are maybe not identical to those being made now but that are similar in nature.  Even if by some miracle the current issues are resolved within the coming weeks and the Assembly and Executive are functioning, we know there will be other issues down the road.  Having young people who have been exposed to different points of view and understand better those with whom they deal is invaluable for any society.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2022102700002#L00900","nonspeaker":"Senator George Mitchell"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666825200,"counter":1227,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Mitchell.

It is great to have him online today and I thank him for all the great work he has done.  Ms Gildernew asked the question I had about the importance of opening up educational opportunities across the island.  I acknowledge all that is being done in this regard through Senator Mitchell's institute and, as he described, by way of the scholarships with which he is associated.<\/p> <p>  I am very concerned that the exchange of students across the island since the Good Friday Agreement has been very low.  The figure is less than 2% for students going either from North to South or South to North.  Is there anything further Senator Mitchell thinks we could do specifically to open up opportunities either for apprenticeships or in further and higher education?  I am also concerned about the closing off of opportunities under the Horizon Europe programme.<\/p><p>Senator Mitchell will be aware of the EU Horizon programme, which is worth &euro;100 million, but because of Brexit, we are in a situation where there will be fewer opportunities for research and development.  Will he speak to the collaboration and networks for research and development between the two islands, North and South, and with the United States as well?

They are now engaged in what is a deeply complex set of issues, many of which have been mentioned.  I cannot do any more than stress what I believe to be the importance, indeed crucial significance, of broadening the education and understanding of young people in terms of their society in relation to others that will enable them to make the right choices when the time comes for them either to vote or to participate actively in governance and to try to bring all of society forward in a positive way.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Conway-Walsh hit on a very important and crucial issue.  I strongly support student exchanges.  My own daughter, who is in college, spent her last semester in London.  She is a student at New York University, and it has a campus in London.  She felt it was a tremendous experience for her.  That was not a conflict situation.  The United States has very good relations with the United Kingdom, as it does with Ireland, but just being in a different place, a different society, with different standards and attitudes was a great learning experience.  That is compounded, given the history and nature of Ireland and Northern Ireland, the separation and what has occurred.  I cannot do any more than say that I strongly support the efforts the committee is undertaking and would do anything I could personally to advance that.  It is one more reason for re-establishing direct and effective rule by the people of Northern Ireland for the people of Northern Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2022102700002#M00200","nonspeaker":"Senator George Mitchell"},{"type":"speech","time":1666825200,"counter":1232,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Mitchell very much.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2022102700002#M00300","speaker":"1501"},{"type":"speech","time":1666825200,"counter":1233,"content":"<p>I now call Senator Frances Black, who is a distinguished Member of our Upper House.

This cannot be forced from outside.  Even if I had the skill and knowledge to do so, which I do not, I could not write up a plan and hand it to leaders in Northern Ireland and say \"Here is the plan for you\".  It must come internally.  That is the only way it can be sustained in any way, moving forward.  What I would try to do, as I did in my opening statement here today, is to impress upon them the importance and significance of what they are doing.  I would point out what their predecessors did 24 years ago, in circumstances far more difficult and challenging, vastly more so.  Many of those present have lived through this, some in Northern Ireland, and they know what it was like during the time of the Troubles.  It was a period of profound concern, anxiety and fear and there was great difficulty in leading a normal life.  Nobody wants to return to that.  The longer they go without solving the current problem, the more likely it is that something like that might happen - God forbid.  I would try to impress upon them the importance of what they are doing, how it will affect millions of people, some not yet born, who they will never know but whose lives will be greatly influenced by their decisions.  Once again, I would cite the courage, strength and vision of those in 1998 who faced circumstances far more difficult and complex, given the nature of the violence that existed then, than current leaders face.<\/p> <p>  I would begin with the assumption of good faith on the part of public officials.  They want to do what is right for their constituency.  They want to do what is right for the full society.  All of the members are elected officials and they know the daily challenge they have is reconciling their commitments to their own constituency as opposed to the national interests.  There is no limit to the capacity of human beings to rationalise their actions, but in the case of Northern Ireland now, the leaders face a decision that will not just affect them and their families but could affect generations to come.  I would do my best to impress upon them the importance of moving forward and being willing to make whatever compromises are necessary.<\/p> <p>  This does not directly respond to the question, but every political party on Earth, without exception, has those whom I call \"the hundred percenters\".  They have to have everything their own way.  Any compromise is a sign of weakness.  I experienced that myself over a long period of time, in particular in the six years I served as the Majority Leader of the United States Senate.  The fact is that, in a democratic society, where there are inevitably differences and disagreements, there has to be a willingness to compromise.  Compromise is not a sign of weakness; it is in fact a sign of strength.  I refer to principled compromise that is trying to serve the greater good of the whole society as opposed to one's immediate constituents.  That is the challenge, and I hope very much that they will be up to it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2022102700002#M00800","nonspeaker":"Senator George Mitchell"},{"type":"speech","time":1666825200,"counter":1238,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Mitchell very much for his response.<\/p><p>As we approach the 25th anniversary, I have always wanted to know which aspect of the Good Friday Agreement is Senator Mitchell most proud of?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2022102700002#M00900","speaker":"1632","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666825200,"counter":1240,"content":"<p>As I said in my opening remarks, I am most affected by and influenced by the consequences of the agreement as opposed to a specific provision of it, and those are the dramatic reduction in violence and the resort to democratic and peaceful means as a democratic form of governance.  My answer to the Senator's specific question is really just bringing it to an end.  It is hard for me to describe to the committee the difficulty of the nearly two years preceding that agreement.  I said on many occasions we had 700 days of failure and one day of success.  It was extraordinarily difficult to keep going in the face of repeated failure, unyielding negativity and unwillingness even to listen to the other side.  It was an experience unlike any I had ever been exposed to and it was hard to keep going and hard to stay positive.  That is what I tried to do, and I tried to keep open what at first seemed non-existent but later became a lane of opportunity through which the parties could pass to get an agreement.  Rather than any specific provision, it is the agreement itself overall and mostly an end to the Troubles that had hung so heavily over the people of Northern Ireland in the preceding decades.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2022102700002#N00200","nonspeaker":"Senator George Mitchell"},{"type":"speech","time":1666825200,"counter":1241,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Mitchell so much.

As Chairman of our committee, I was privileged to go with a deputation to Washington.  We met Senator Chuck Schumer, who holds the position Senator Mitchell once held.  Every door in the US and in Washington was open to us because of the connectivity between the Irish diaspora and all the political parties in Washington.  I understand that if things change in the US in the week after next, the name McCarthy could be in that office, so we are very anxious to keep up our contacts with America.  The American influence was exemplified by Senator Mitchell and President Clinton but we very much welcome the commentary from President Biden, who is clear on his support for the Good Friday Agreement.  Even though the difficulties are not totally resolved between the two governments east and west, President Biden's support for the agreement has been important.<\/p> <p>  We cannot underestimate, and I think we are all of one voice here, the importance of Senator Mitchell's work, which is part of history and will always be there and will always be relied on.  The Senator himself spoke of 700 days of failure and one day of success.  All parliamentarians can attend this committee to engage with the unionist community, particularly their political representatives.  It is important to pay tribute to the late David Trimble, who was key in bringing about the peace deal.  Our biggest challenge is to engage in an appropriate way that is acceptable to unionism about the future of all of us together in some new formula or arrangement.  I do not know if Senator Mitchell has any views on that.  I just feel it is important I pay tribute to David Trimble and to point out the steps we collectively have to make to finish the task you all started.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2022102700002#N00500","speaker":"1598"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666825200,"counter":1244,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman.  On American support, I am no longer a US Government official but I can accurately state there is broad bipartisan support in the US for a resolution of the differences that continue in Northern Ireland and for a resolution of any differences between the Republic of Ireland and the UK.  Specifically, there is very strong support for the full implementation and continuation of the provisions of the Good Friday Agreement, especially as they affect the Border.<\/p> <p>  I was very fortunate that President Clinton asked me to serve, at first in a very limited capacity, and then ultimately the Prime Minister and Taoiseach asked me to serve as chairman of the talks..  It meant a lot to me personally.  My father's parents were born in Ireland.  They emigrated to the US just before 1900.  My father was born in Boston, where they settled, but he never knew his parents.  His mother died and his father could not care for the children so he and his siblings were raised in Catholic orphanages in Boston.  My father was adopted by an elderly, childless couple from the state of Maine where I live and am at this moment.  He had a tough life with no education and worked as a labourer and a janitor.  His adoptive parents were not Irish so he did not have any real sense of his Irish heritage.  I, by the grace of God, had the good fortune to be asked to go to Ireland and, in a sense, I am the principal beneficiary of it because I have learned a lot about the land of my father's parents and it has filled in me a void I did not even know existed about my Irish heritage.<\/p> <p>  If I can conclude this serious stuff on a humorous note, the first questioner mentioned the bridge connecting Northern Ireland and Ireland.  I went there for the dedication and there were a whole bunch of ceremonies, meetings, speeches and so forth.  At one small gathering I was asked about my father and there was sort of disbelief at how I knew so little about him.  A couple said to me they were in the business of genealogy and, if I hired them, they would track down my father's heritage.  The local councillor, who had a typical sly Irish sense of humour said, \"Senator, if you pay them enough, they will connect you to Brian Boru.\"  I did not do it but to me it is all a labour of love.
