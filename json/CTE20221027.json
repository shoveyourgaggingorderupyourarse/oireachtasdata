It is imperative that they comply with any such direction.<\/p><p>Members are reminded of the provisions within Standing Order 218 that the committee shall refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government, or a Minister of the Government, or the merits of the objectives of such policies.<\/p><p>Members are also reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not comment on, criticise, or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.<\/p><p>I now call on the Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, for his opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022102700002#A00600","speaker":"1491"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666859400,"counter":10,"content":"<p>The 2021 appropriation account for Vote 40 records gross expenditure of &euro;1.8 billion.  This was distributed across five output programmes that provide a broad range of services to meet the needs of children and of vulnerable persons in society.<\/p> <p>  Programme A provides for children and family support.  This is the largest area of spending under the Vote, at approximately &euro;888 million, or 49% of the total.  The grant to Tusla, amounting to &euro;857 million in 2021, represents the bulk of the spending on the programme.<\/p> <p>  Programme B comprises funding for a wide range of schemes and programmes to benefit children and young people, at a combined cost of &euro;680 million in 2021.  This area of spending has increased rapidly in recent years, and it was significantly affected by Covid-19 restrictions over the past two years.  Most of the schemes funded under the programme are administered by Pobal, acting as an agent on behalf of the Department.<\/p> <p>  Expenditure of just over &euro;200 million in 2021 was charged to programme E, which funds the provision of support for international protection seekers.<\/p><p>Most of the expenditure was in respect of accommodation for persons seeking international protection, accounting for &euro;191 million in 2021.  Members will be aware of the very significant additional pressures in that regard that have fallen on the Department in 2022, as a result of the Russian invasion of Ukraine.<br\/><br\/>The remaining two Vote programmes are on a smaller scale.  One supports a range of equality initiatives, the other caters for policy development and legislation within the Department&rsquo;s remit.  Due mainly to savings that occurred across the Vote, the surplus at the end of 2021 was &euro;98.5 million.  The Department was allowed to carry &euro;3.2 million over to 2022, to fund capital works, but surrendered &euro;95 million at the year end.<br\/><br\/>A clear audit opinion was issued in relation to the appropriation account.  However, I drew attention to the disclosure by the Accounting Officer in the statement on internal financial control regarding non-compliance with procurement rules.  This was mainly in relation to contracts put in place for the provision of accommodation to international protection seekers.<br\/><br\/>Members may also wish to note that, while the Department has been developing its ICT infrastructure, it still relied in early 2021 on the provision of financial management system services by the Department of Health.  This support service was interrupted as a result of the ransomware attack on health sector bodies that occurred in May 2021.  Work-around processes were adopted for a period, and completion of a planned migration of the Department&rsquo;s financial management service away from the Department of Health&rsquo;s systems was accelerated.  Normal financial management functions were resumed by the end of June 2021.<br\/><br\/>I turn now to the chapter which is on the agenda for today.  A guardian <i>ad litem<\/i>is an independent person appointed by a court to ensure the best interests and views of a child or children are heard in public family law proceedings.  While the service is provided at the direction of the courts, the costs of the service are discharged by Tusla, even though the organisation is a party to the family law proceedings.  The cost of the guardian <i>ad litem<\/i>service averages at &euro;14 million to &euro;15 million a year.  Costs vary widely at the individual case level.  I previously examined the operation of the guardian <i>ad litem<\/i>service, and published a report on my findings in September 2016.  That report contained three recommendations which, at the time, were agreed to by the Department and by Tusla.  Our examination this year found that the recommendations had not been implemented, for a variety of reasons.  However, a revised legislative<i><\/i>basis<i><\/i>for the provision of the guardian <i>ad litem<\/i>service was finalised in July of this year, with the enactment of the Child Care (Amendment) Act 2022.  This potentially removes the main obstacles that prevented progress being made in developing effective management oversight and control mechanisms for the service.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022102700002#A00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1666859400,"counter":12,"content":"<p>I welcome Mr. Kevin McCarthy back to the committee room.

I am accompanied by my colleagues Ms Carol Baxter, assistant secretary; Dr. Anne-Marie Brooks, assistant secretary; Ms Sheenagh Rooney, assistant secretary; and Ms Lara Hynes, acting assistant secretary.  We are also supported by Mr. Gordon Gaffney, finance officer; Mr. Andrew Patterson, principal officer; Ms Marie-Louise Molloy, professional accountant; Ms Erin Ryle, administrative officer; and David Byrne, principal officer.  <br\/><br\/>In my opening statement I will give a very brief overview of the main features of the Vote.  I hope the more detailed briefing supplied in advance of the meeting is of assistance to the committee in providing a fuller picture of the work of the Department and its expenditure.  As we all know, the year 2021 brought ongoing challenges from the Covid-19 pandemic which continued to impact on how we delivered services and required ongoing adaptation and innovation in order to support our objectives to enhance the lives of children and young people, adults, families and communities; to recognise diversity; and to promote equality of opportunity in Ireland.  <br\/><br\/>During the year there were some minor changes to the responsibilities under the remit of the Department.  There was a transfer out of functions related to education welfare services from the Department to the Department of Education and responsibility for the Balance for Better Business initiative transferred to the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  Both transfers took effect from January 2021.  The total provision for the Vote in 2021 was &euro;1.923 billion which included capital carryover of &euro;4.1 million.  <br\/><br\/>In terms of the Vote, three spending areas represent almost 90% of the overall Vote spending in 2022, namely Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, early learning and childcare, and international protection seekers' accommodation.  The current expenditure allocation was &euro;1.887 billion, with a further &euro;36.1 million allocated for capital expenditure, including capital carryover.  The net allocation for the Vote was &euro;1.884 billion when appropriations-in-aid of &euro;39.1 million are taken into account.  The final outturn for the Vote in 2021 was &euro;1.785 billion, with a surplus of &euro;98.5 million of which &euro;3.2 million is to be deferred as capital carryover to 2022 leaving a total to be surrendered at year end of &euro;95.3 million.  <br\/><br\/>During 2021, Covid-19 continued to impact on spending across all areas of the Vote.  In Quarter 1 of 2021, the Early Childhood Care and Education Programme, ECCE, was suspended and access to other early learning and childcare services were restricted to children of essential workers and children experiencing disadvantage.  Moreover, for the remainder of 2021, there was a reduced demand for early learning and childcare owing to changes in parental working arrangements and other Covid-19-related issues.  This led to savings across all early learning and childcare funding programmes, namely ECCE, access and inclusion model, AIM, and the national childcare scheme, and resulted in an underspend of &euro;46.7m, or 7% of the allocation of &euro;640.2 million for early learning and childcare. <br\/><br\/>The impact of Covid-19 also contributed to an underspend of &euro;27.2 million, or 12% of the 2021 provision of &euro;218 million for international protection seekers' accommodation and related services costs.  It should be noted that restrictions on international travel resulted in lower than anticipated arrivals and demand for international accommodation.  Towards the end of 2021 as we emerged from Covid-19 restrictions, expenditure across the Vote, particularly in areas such as early learning and childcare and international protection accommodation, started to rebound and this has continued apace into 2022.  All other areas on the Vote also started to return to normal patterns of spending.  <br\/><br\/>When I addressed the committee in June, I referenced the significant impact the outbreak of the war in Ukraine was having on the work of the Department.  The demands of this situation have not abated in the meantime.  The Department&rsquo;s role in the humanitarian response to the needs of Ukrainians arriving here under the temporary protection directive continues to pose major challenges and has involved a significant diversion and allocation of staffing resources.  The parallel and significant increase in numbers of applicants for international protection in 2022 has also placed extreme pressure on resources.  The overall requirements of this response, including the use of various forms of emergency accommodation, has had, and will continue to have, a significant impact on costs in 2022 and beyond as the Department continues to deal with the twin challenges of providing accommodation for Ukrainians and other international protection applicants.  <br\/><br\/>I refer also to Chapter 13 of the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s Report on the Accounts of the Public Services 2021.  This chapter is a follow-up report on guardian <i>ad litem <\/i>or GAL reform.  As the committee is aware, GALs are appointed in child care proceedings to ascertain the views of the child and communicate these to the court.  The GAL also makes recommendations to the court as to what is in the best interests of the child.  The Department has acknowledged that the present arrangements for GAL services are in need of significant reform.  Work has been ongoing for several years to provide the legislative underpinning necessary for this reform.  The committee will be aware that the Child Care (Amendment) Act 2022, which provides for the reform of the GAL system, and will enable the<br\/><br\/>Minister to establish a new national GAL service, was signed into law on 19 July.  The Department intends to publish a request for tender in the coming weeks for the development of an operating model and practice manuals for the new GAL service and legal services unit.  This will build on significant work already undertaken, including costings prepared for different models of the service, the development of an IT system to be used by GALs for case management, and extensive discussions with relevant stakeholders.  The Department also has sanction for a director post for the new office, and intends to recruit a<br\/><br\/>director for the service next year.  It is expected that the body of work to establish the executive office and the new national service will continue throughout 2023 and into 2024.  The purpose of this reform is to regulate and expand the provision of GAL services in a consistent manner across the country.  The reformed service will enhance the rights of children and the capacity of the courts to make the right decisions in helping children and their families.<\/p><p>The reformed service will enhance the rights of children and the capacity of the courts to make the right decisions in helping children and their families.  I am satisfied that it can also address the concerns raised in the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General regarding the costs of the service and the lack of transparency and oversight that exists under the current unregulated system.<\/p><p> Finally, in reviewing the 2021 accounts, I would like to take this opportunity to thank all my colleagues in the Department, and our partner agencies and providers, for the enormous contributions they have made in sustaining delivery on so many our objectives during 2021 and since in the face of successive unprecedented challenges from the Covid-19 pandemic and the war in Ukraine.  I thank the committee members and Chairman for their attention and look forward to taking their questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022102700002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Kevin McCarthy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1666859400,"counter":15,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. McCarthy.

Some 43,000 people have been accommodated by the State and 43,000 medical cards have been issued.  Ten thousand have found employment.

I ask that our guests would put together a register of those.

The minute of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform is the official response to the recommendations of this committee.  I raised this matter with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform last week as the minute is not in line with the Department&rsquo;s own circular, that is, Circular 01\/2011.

That has not been done in regard to any of the recommendations in our report.

At some point, someone - whether it is this committee or someone else - will need to look at how we got this so wrong on so many different levels such that the outlay to the taxpayer was far beyond what anybody would have dared suggest at the outset.  I have no doubt that one of the problems that will be identified is the level of secrecy and lack of transparency throughout the process.  In order for this committee to be vindicated, we need to continuously record our dissatisfaction with the way in which information is being withheld.  This correspondence from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform informs the committee that the Department of Health has stated that the information relating to costings is commercially sensitive.  I propose that we write back to the Department of Health again to express our view that the information should be provided to the committee and requesting that this should be done, if for no other reason than to ensure that it will be on the public record that the committee did everything to try to have throughout the process the accountability that has been sadly lacking.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022102700002#BB00500","speaker":"1451"},{"type":"speech","time":1666859400,"counter":894,"content":"<p>I agree with both Deputies.  The issue I am concerned about is that we were told that we are more than 70% of the way through this contract and there is no final price.  We do not even have a ballpark figure for the final price.  We have made numerous efforts in respect of this matter.  It is two years and three months since we started trying to shed some light on it.  If a person was three quarters of the way through building a house and still did not know the final price, it would not be a good place to be.  I am not too sure what you would tell the bank in such circumstances.  The bank in this case is of course Joe Public.  I suggest that we write to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to ask whether it knows what will be the final cost.  We do not know; we are not being told.  As Deputy Carthy correctly stated, the letter dated 14 October 2022 indicates that in light of the fact that a commercially sensitive contract is in operation, any queries about final costs of the project should be directed to the Department of Health.  I propose that we write to Mr. Moloney to ask whether he knows and also write to the Secretary General of the Department of Health, Mr. Robert Watt.  Mr. Watt was the Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform when this contract for the national children's hospital was put in place.

Having looked at similar projects abroad, there are two issues.  One is that the main infrastructure has now been built and there is a major issue regarding disputes between the contractors and the project team.  However, one of the issues that is out of the way relates to the substantial increase in building costs.  We are lucky that the main infrastructure was in place before we ended up with a major increase in costs.  If we had started this project last year, it would have increased by much more in a shorter timeframe.  The problem we have relates to the various issues under dispute.  My understanding from the previous discussion is that there are 700 or 800 issues and that these have been parked.

There is a perception of a saving, by virtue of the fact that we do not have organisations like for example, the Corporate Enforcement Agency that has been set up, properly resourced.  It was guaranteed 16 members of the Garda but only has seven at the moment.  It still does not have its full complement.  It cannot do its work if it does not have the resources.  If we do not have organisations that can properly regulate and enforce, we will then end up paying in retrospect by way of inquiries.  We really have to grasp the nettle on this.<\/p> <p>  I have a previous response that I got from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform going back to 2019 on this issue.  The cost of inquiries at the end of 2018 was &euro;457 million, almost half a billion euro, and it lists those costs down.  That is right across all Departments, where each would have been the parent Department, whereas this is exclusively related to the Department of the Taoiseach.  Some of them were included in this response.  I can look at the response this committee got in 2019 and at the one we are discussing at the moment.  The investigation into certain matters relating to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is down at &euro;3.5 million.  When I look at this reply that I got previously, it makes me wonder if it was the same inquiry.  I am not sure if there were two.

It is a proposal for the committee to make inquiries regarding the change of ownership in respect of the national broadband plan.  Does Deputy Murphy wish to come in on that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022102700002#DD02500","speaker":"1491"},{"type":"speech","time":1666859400,"counter":947,"content":"<p>When the Department was before the committee a couple of weeks ago, I pursued it on this particular topic and it looked like the new entity was nearing completion.

That is what I am seeking from the Department.  There were things like clawbacks and shareholding.  I raised some of those specific issues with the Department and it was not able to respond because things had not concluded at that stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022102700002#DD02600","speaker":"1489"},{"type":"speech","time":1666859400,"counter":948,"content":"<p>There is substantial change of ownership taking place.

The other question is whether there will be any proceeds to the State.  I know some elements of the contract for the national broadband plan contained a piece that where the contract has been sold and there is a gain in that, there is a clawback for the State.

It is further correspondence to the committee regarding the social welfare appeals office and requests that the committee take further action as regards the further classification of certain workers.  The issues raised have been considered by the committee and the Joint Committee on Social Protection, Community and Rural Development and the Islands.  We have also provided the correspondent with a copy of our report on the classification of workers, whether employees, employers or contractors, as well as related correspondence.  We have advised that we will examine the Comptroller and Auditor General's chapter on the classification of workers for PRSI purposes with the Department of Social Protection.

We will note and publish No. 1516C.<\/p> <p>  No. 1522C, dated 19 October 2022, is from an individual and relates to the use of public funds to support Ukraine.  The correspondent takes the view that the State is participating in the war and is, therefore, breaching Article 28.3 of the Constitution which states \"War shall not be declared and the State shall not participate in any war save with the assent of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.\"  This matter has been raised in the Houses and is one for the D&aacute;il and Seanad.  The role of this committee is to examine related expenditure of the relevant State bodies once their accounts have been circulated.  I propose to advise the correspondent of that.  I have flagged up the issue.  The correspondent quotes the Constitution, on which I think all members have a handle.  The issue is whether it is the role of the committee to decide whether neutrality has been breached.  To substantiate his case, the correspondent supplied a copy of extracts of what he said were from a speech by the Minister for Defence, Deputy Coveney.  I suggest we write to the Minister to ask for a response because the correspondent quotes him making certain statements on 29 April 2022 at an event in the John Fitzgerald Kennedy centre in Boston.  Is it agreed that we send the correspondence to the Minister seeking a response?  This is not really the role of the committee.  It is a matter for the Oireachtas to define, make rules and decide on our position on neutrality and it is up to the Houses to interpret and define neutrality and decide whether we are going beyond it.  I heard part of a discussion this week in the D&aacute;il.  It would be useful to get clarity on that because funding is being provided, we want to be clear on what it is being used for.  The Minister is entitled to an opportunity to respond.  We have these quotations.  I was not familiar with the speech the Minister is quoted as having given on 29 April.  We will ask him for a response.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.<\/p> <p>  Moving on to our work programme, next week is a non-sitting week due to the Hallowe'en bank holiday.  We will engage with Greyhound Racing Ireland on 10 November.  On 17 November, we will engage with the Department of Finance.  The regulator of the National Lottery will attend on 24 November.  On 1 December, we have two engagements.  The first is with the Department of Social Protection and the second will be on the operation of the National Lottery.  On 8 December, we will have the Office of the Revenue Commissioners before us.  The final engagement, on 15 December, is with the Office of Public Works, OPW.  We have also agreed to engage with An Bord Plean&aacute;la in the new year.  Are there any matters members wish to raise regarding the work programme?  No.  That concludes our consideration of the work programme for the day.<\/p> <p>  The final matter on the public agenda is any other business.  Do members wish to raise any matters?  No.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022102700002#EE01500","speaker":"1491"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1666859400,"counter":965,"content":"<p>The committee went into private session at 2.28 p.m. and adjourned at 2.42 p.m. until 9.30 a.m. on Thursday, 10 November 2022.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"}]
