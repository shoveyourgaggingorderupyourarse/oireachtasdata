Last March, the Taoiseach said the State would accommodate 200,000 Ukrainian refugees but he had no real plan as to how he would meet that commitment.  The Irish people have welcomed some 60,000 refugees from Ukraine and the system is already overwhelmed.  On Friday next, the latest homelessness figures are to be published and all indicators suggest that we will see another shameful increase in people in emergency accommodation.  Meanwhile an entire generation is locked out of affordable housing and opportunity.  They weigh up the prospect of life from Boston, Perth or Toronto.<\/p>  <p>  All the strands of this social catastrophe are linked by the Government&rsquo;s failure to plan, organise and ultimately its failure to deliver.  There is no doubt that the Government is top of the class at when it comes to announcing big targets that grab the headlines.  It gets an A+ on that score.  But time and again it falls short when it comes to delivery.  This failure to plan and deliver means we now see crisis heaped upon crisis.  We see massive pressure heaped onto a housing system that is already broken beyond recognition.  And this means that everyone loses.  You lose if you have spent years desperately searching for an affordable home and you also lose if you come here to this country fleeing a terrible war in search of shelter and help.  So people are now frustrated.  They asked how on earth it is that nine months after Russia invaded Ukraine, the Government is now scrambling to put together a plan.  How is it that the Government is appealing to the public for help but at the same time, people's offers to accommodate refugees are being ignored?  It seems that the Government&rsquo;s approach was to outsource the State's response, cross its fingers and hope for the best.  What people see is the same incompetence and infuriating lack of pace that the Government has brought to addressing the domestic housing crisis.  Not content with denying our own people the right to an affordable, secure roof over their heads, the Government now extends its catastrophic failure to those coming to Ireland seeking humanitarian assistance.<\/p> <p>De thairbhe theip an Rialtais tabhairt faoi phlean&aacute;il, t&aacute; an gh&eacute;arch&eacute;im tith&iacute;ochta imithe in olcas agus an St&aacute;t faoi bhr&uacute; l&oacute;ist&iacute;n a shol&aacute;thar d&oacute;ibh si&uacute;d at&aacute; ag &eacute;al&uacute; &oacute;n chogadh.

It claims that housing is its number-one priority but it is now time to back up those words with what matters: delivery.  We all know there is a housing shortage but what is the Government doing to ensure offers of accommodation for those fleeing war will come on stream quickly?  The outsourcing system is not fit for purpose.  When will we see a change in Government housing policy to ensure members of the locked-out generation can finally put an affordable and secure roof over their heads?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102500003#A00200","speaker":"1466","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1666703100,"counter":8,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising the issue.  Her commentary and some of the debate on this issue in recent days has become somewhat detached from the reality we find ourselves confronted with.  We need to be very clear about what this is all about, what has happened, where we are and where we go from here.  The first thing that has to be done is to acknowledge and pay tribute to the extraordinary Irish national effort in response to Putin's illegal and immoral invasion of his neighbour, Ukraine.  We have all watched in horror as this man has ordered ruthless attacks on civilians by air, land and sea, displacing up to 7.2 million people all over Europe.  He is doing it with greater intensity now by raining down drones on the people of Ukraine and their energy infrastructure.  We have responded to that terror with unprecedented warmth, generosity and support.  More than 55,000 Ukrainians have sought and received refuge in our country, one of the highest figures within the EU, which the Deputy does not acknowledge.  She calls it a disaster, which is extraordinary language to be using.  Approximately 43,000 of those are being accommodated by the State in various ways.  In addition, we have accommodated 9,000 seeking international protection.  This number will rise to about 14,000 by the end of the year.  That is not a story of failure; it is a story of families in every corner of this country and communities across this country opening their homes and hearts to people who are fleeing war.  That is the story of Ireland's response to the war in Ukraine.  The Deputy should not try to have it both ways and try to play crude domestic politics.  It is a story of a massive effort by our public servants across the board, across Government and across the country.  It is a story about people understanding how much it means to help people fleeing war in another land.<\/p>  <p>  We need to be careful of the implications of how this gets articulated.  The only person I see who would get solace from what the Deputy said and the manner in which she said it is Putin himself.  That is what Putin wants to do.  He wants to create the impression across Europe that Europe cannot cope with or manage this.  That is why the Iranian drones are being dropped all over Ukraine right now, destroying energy infrastructure.  It is because Putin wants to make life unbearable for Ukrainians and the country and uninhabitable.  Therefore, we have to make sure that he does not succeed with that agenda.  Right across the board, we have provided a range of accommodation options, not just one, and we will continue to do so.  We will continue to work in solidarity with our EU colleagues in terms of the directive to protect and do everything we can to help Ukrainians fleeing war.  That will be achieved through a range of options, including procuring accommodation, building fresh accommodation and reconfiguring buildings.  There will be challenges along the way and there will be ups and downs and bumps along the road.  Of that, let there be no doubt.  This will be the case throughout Europe; it is not an Irish phenomenon.  Many other capital cities and countries are challenged by this unprecedented humanitarian crisis, brought about by the war in Ukraine.  It is unprecedented since the Second World War to have millions of people displaced and forced out of their homes by a war.  That is the context.  I do not accept the Deputy's analysis of it at all.<\/p> <p>In some respects as well, I note that the Deputy has intertwined this issue with the housing crisis.  The only incompetent thing I saw in recent weeks was a suggestion that we should do what the former UK Government did in regard to energy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102500004#B00200","speaker":"1458","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1666703400,"counter":10,"content":"<p>There is no need to convince anyone of either the vile criminal actions of Vladimir Putin or the incredible generosity and warmth that has been displayed by the Irish people.

It is fair to say that across Ireland, communities have been dismayed to see people fleeing the brutal war in Ukraine having to sleep on the floor in Dublin Airport.  That is a matter of grave concern, dismay and distress to communities across Ireland that have been so generous in offering refuge to the thousands of people who have had to come here because of the brutal invasion of their democratic, sovereign homeland by Russia; by Putin and his brutal army.<\/p>  <p>  It is disappointing that there was not engagement back in the spring or earlier in the summer by the Government to ensure that we would have short-term, medium-term and long-term planning in place in order that this would not happen.  Back in July, I hosted a briefing here in the Oireachtas with members of the Ukraine Civil Society Forum at which they called for that level of planning to be put in place, and at which they and members of the Ukrainian community here called for a co-ordinated whole-of-government response led by the Taoiseach.  That is what is needed now.<\/p> <p>For too long, it seems, the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth has been left to bear almost full responsibility for the housing of and provision of support to those who come here fleeing war and to the communities here who are supporting them so generously and ably.  That has not been good enough and that is why we are in the position we are in now.<\/p> <p> We in the Labour Party want to offer constructive support and engagement with the Taoiseach and the Government and that is why I wrote to him yesterday seeking that he would provide all Opposition leaders and spokespersons with a briefing on the current status of accommodation for those fleeing war in Ukraine and, indeed, those seeking international protection.  I sought that briefing on the current situation but also sought a briefing on future planning.  In the spring, the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage wrote to us in the Opposition and asked us to supply him with details on vacant properties in our areas, and we sent details to his office.  Through our party&rsquo;s housing spokesperson, Senator Moynihan, we put forward a range of properties in our constituencies, including Baggot Street hospital in my area and other properties too.  I have been engaging with the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman's, Department, as have other colleagues.  We have not heard back with updates on the properties we have proposed.<\/p> <p> We want to see local communities and local authorities be far more strongly engaged in this process.  We want to see a whole-of-government approach and a ramping-up of efforts to unlock the capacity we know is here in this country.  We have been very generous in our approach but across Europe we have seen generosity.  The Czech Republic has taken in four times as many refugees from Ukraine per head of population as we have.  We are seeing enormous efforts across Europe because European democracy is under threat.  The Taoiseach is absolutely correct; Putin is weaponising refugee flows and we cannot let him win.  That is why we need to ensure the Opposition and the Government are engaged together in this collective effort.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102500005#C03300","speaker":"1698","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1666704000,"counter":43,"content":"<p>First, I accept the Deputy&rsquo;s bona fides.  I received her letter yesterday and we will set in train that briefing she requested.<\/p>  <p>  Those countries closest to Ukraine have the highest numbers of Ukrainians coming in, namely, Czechia, Poland, Estonia, Lithuania, Bulgaria and Latvia.  Then you have Cyprus, Slovakia and Germany and then you have Ireland.  We are taking the equivalent of about 1.2% of our population.  Ireland is ahead of Austria, Finland, Switzerland, Luxembourg, Denmark, Norway, Slovenia, Belgium, Portugal, the Netherlands, Croatia, Sweden, Romania, Hungary, Italy, Spain, Malta, Greece and France in terms of the numbers we have taken in.  We need perspective on it.  It is challenging for all countries and, to be fair to the other countries I mentioned, they have challenges on international protection as well as the situation in Ukraine.<\/p>  <p>  As for the approach being taken, I chair a Cabinet committee on this.  A group of senior officials meets every week, and has been meeting every week, on this issue to try to identify new opportunities, Baggot Street hospital being one.  That is being developed but it is going to be take time in terms of the physical work that has to go into getting it ready.  Moreover, the reconfiguration of public and private buildings is under way across the country to create additional capacity.  There is rapid-build housing and while concerns have been expressed in communities, with some public representatives against it, it will have to be a feature of housing generally into the future.  These are good-quality houses that can be built much faster.  We have already started with 500 units but that will have to go to a much higher level.  I foresee a significant ramping up of rapid-build houses to respond to the general housing issue and to help with the emergency created by those fleeing war in Ukraine and with emergency housing more generally.  Overall, about 55,000 people have come in from Ukraine and we are looking at about 14,000 individuals this year seeking international protection.  We have other pressures within Europe relating to emergency housing, whereby people who present as homeless come in looking for emergency housing.  There is a general increase in the numbers who are seeking fairly quick access to housing, in addition to the general housing situation.  <\/p>  <p>  Those are the plans that are under way and they involve a lot of Departments, such as the Departments of Foreign Affairs and Defence, which are represented on that committee.  For example, a number of barracks and other Army facilities that were formerly used for other purposes are being reconfigured with a view to providing accommodation and so on.  The Department of Foreign Affairs co-ordinates the issue and keeps the rest of the Cabinet abreast on what is happening in other countries within Europe and the pressures they are under.  The Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, obviously, is a key part of it and the local authorities have been doing a lot of work in respect of this issue.  They will continue to do so and will do even more, along with the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, of course, which has been the lead Department in respect of the broader issue of migration and integration into the country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102500006#D00200","speaker":"1458"},{"type":"speech","time":1666704600,"counter":44,"content":"<p>I thank the Taoiseach for indicating that he will engage formally with Opposition leaders and spokespersons on this.

In my view, it has to be a cross-departmental and multi-departmental approach.  That is why at Government level, having a Cabinet subcommittee and a senior official group is the best structure to do that.

That is the equivalent loss of life of a transatlantic flight falling from the sky.  It is a catastrophe that is happening silently and invisibly every other day on the streets in which we live.  There were 47 deaths across homeless services in Dublin in 2018, 49 in 2019 and 76 in 2020.  Last year, in 2021, incredibly, 115 people died in homeless services.  So far this year, 70 people are recorded to have lost their lives in the Dublin homeless services.  It does not bear thinking about but those figures are set to increase due to the fact that the weather is going to get colder and more severe over the next number of months.<\/p>  <p>  These figures were released to Aont&uacute; by Dublin City Council under the Freedom of Information Act.  If we were to submit the same question to any other local authority in Ireland right now, however, we would be met with stoney silence because no other local authority actually records the number of people who die in homelessness around the country.  It is an incredible thing that the vast majority of local authorities are not even recording this.  It is an absolute scandal.  If we are not even measuring this incredible situation, how will we ever get to a situation where we are finding solutions to it?<\/p>  <p>  I have been raising this issue of homeless deaths for the last number of years and different Ministers with responsibility for housing have tried to explain it away.  Some said these deaths are just part of a natural attrition that happens.  Others said these are the results of car accidents etc.  The truth be told, however, and the Taoiseach should know this, homelessness is a direct cause of death.  People who are homeless for longer than 18 months are eight times more likely to die than a person who is homeless for less than six months.  Right now, on the streets of our capital city, people are dying directly as a result of homelessness.<\/p> <p>When I raised this matter previously, the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage commissioned Dr. Austin O'Carroll, a north inner city GP, to research the causes of these deaths and propose solutions.  I welcome the fact that this happened.  If the Taoiseach looks at the figures, he will see that there is little evidence we are getting to grips with this crisis.  The Government is missing all of its housing targets.  The Dublin Housing Delivery Group submitted a report to the Minister recently indicating that there is evidence of a slow-down in social housing projects and that work has ceased on some sites.<\/p> <p> This is a record-breaking Government for all the wrong reasons.  There are record numbers of people accessing emergency accommodation.  There are record numbers of children accessing emergency accommodation.  House prices are at record levels.  Rents are at record levels and last year we had a record for the number of people who died in homelessness in our capital city.  All of these indicators are going the wrong way under Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael and the Green Party in government.  Will the Taoiseach commit to recording the number of deaths of homeless people in every county and will he detail the progress so far on the implementation of the recommendations made in the Interim Report on Mortality in the Single Homeless Population 2020?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102500007#E00300","speaker":"1504","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1666705200,"counter":48,"content":"<p>The death of anyone who is homeless is a tragedy.  We extend our sympathies to the families concerned.  I refer, in particular, to the deaths of people availing of homeless services.  That matter is taken very seriously.  The Deputy made a fairly bald statement in the context of offering an almost a direct juxtaposition between the numbers who have died and the position regarding homelessness.  I do not think the figures bear that out.  The Deputy quoted the Dublin Regional Homeless Executive, DRHE records.  That organisation records death notifications from all of its funded residential and outreach services in line with a procedural agreement with the Health Service Executive.  These services include support for people in permanent tenancy - people who have been taken out of homelessness but are in permanent tenancies - including Housing First, for example, long-term supported accommodation and people receiving tenancy support who are not counted in the Department's homeless figures.  We have to be very careful.  Is the Deputy saying that all of those deaths occurred because people were homeless?  Not necessarily; that is the point.  Also, homelessness is a complex issue and we must take into account the range of issues that can lead to someone becoming homeless.  Some 37 of the 70 deaths the Deputy identified were in the categories I have just mentioned.  In other words, they related to people in permanent tenancies and not in a state of homelessness.  Nonetheless, it is still extremely sad and tragic that anyone would lose their life but I do not have the specific causes of death for those 37 people .  To be fair to everyone, perhaps more research is required in respect of those figures before we draw the conclusions the Deputy seems to be drawing in respect of the figures he articulated.<\/p>  <p>  I believe all local authorities should follow the example of the DRHE in how it records people within its homeless services.  As the Deputy knows, we are moving much more towards the Housing First approach to homelessness which is actually giving people a permanent tenancy almost from day one if that is possible.  We just need to be very careful in terms of how we describe this and how we analyse and research it.  That is all I would say in that regard.<\/p>  <p>  There is a pilot study on data collection of homeless deaths nationally which has been undertaken by the Health Research Board on behalf of the Department of Health.  The Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage is liaising with the Department of Health and the Health Research Board on this study.  I will talk to the Ministers for Health and Housing, Local Government and Heritage to see if anything more needs to be added to that research in order to get as complete a picture as we possibly can.  The research is very important because it can inform policy.  We saw during Covid how a strong synergy between those two Departments on homelessness reaped significant dividends for the homeless in the context of a positive response on the Covid issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102500008#F00200","speaker":"1458"},{"type":"speech","time":1666705200,"counter":49,"content":"<p>I am surprised at the Taoiseach.

Equivocating or fudging at this point in 2022, after years of this, is simply not good enough.<\/p> <p>Ten or 15 years ago, the Government might have had an excuse for doing so.  However, equivocating on these figures, the direct correlation and the cause and effect that is happening on the streets of Dublin is wrong at this point.  If that is the stage the Government is at, it surely will be a problem in terms of urgently putting resources in place to fix the situation.  Dr. O'Carroll, who was commissioned by the Minister, said that the length of time for which a person is homeless leads directly to an increased chance of mortality.  We know the number of people dying correlates exactly with the number who are homeless.  The truth is that people do not have access to primary care, mental health services and dual diagnosis services.  They are living in conditions where they are exposed to the weather, to violence on the streets, alcoholism, etc.  All of those issues are contributing factors to the deaths that are occurring.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102500008#F00300","speaker":"1504","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1666705500,"counter":51,"content":"<p>Thank you, Deputy.

This week, the Government is asking the D&aacute;il to vote for the provision of emergency generators that will run on liquefied petroleum gas, LPG, and, crucially, will also have the capacity to run on green hydrogen, if and when it becomes available.  One of the Government's first acts was to announce an exploration ban on the extraction of oil or gas in Irish waters.  I am told there are people in the energy sector who wish to explore for gas, particularly off the west coast, where there is infrastructure.  The crucial difference between the gas coming in from the west of Ireland and LPG is that the carbon footprint of LPG is far higher because not alone do we burn it, there is also the energy used to transport it here.  The Taoiseach could not have predicted the energy crisis when the Government announced the ban on exploration.  Will he revisit it in light of what we know now?<\/p>  <p>  One of the rationales posited for the ban at the time was that by keeping fossil fuels in the ground, we will incentivise the use of sustainable alternatives, but that did not happen.  The European Commission has said Ireland and Denmark are the two countries most suitable for the production of biomethane.  Denmark now meets one quarter of its gas needs by way of biomethane and it is saying it will meet 100% of its needs in this way by 2034.  We do not produce any biomethane of any significance.  An EU scheme was announced whereby billions of euro were made available for countries to develop their biomethane sectors to meet the energy crisis.  When I asked the Taoiseach about this before, he said I would get a direct reply from the Minister.  Only after I asked the latter about it did I find out we did not even apply for that scheme.  Italy is getting almost &euro;5 billion to develop its biomethane sector.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102500009#G01400","speaker":"1518"},{"type":"speech","time":1666706100,"counter":64,"content":"<p>It is getting loans.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102500010#H00100","speaker":"1458"},{"type":"speech","time":1666706100,"counter":65,"content":"<p>It is money that can be used to provide an alternative to carbon, which is the Government's stated intention.

There was an opportunity to get it from the European Commission and the Government did not avail of it.  We are told that wind, particularly offshore wind, is the answer.  Ireland is the country in Europe that is most suitable for producing wind energy.  At the moment, we produce 24 MW of offshore energy.  Scotland, by comparison, produces 1.9 GW - or 1,900 MW - and is hoping to increase that to 11 GW by 2030.  We have recently upped our 2030 target from 5 GW to 7 GW.

Why?  Because we wanted to reduce our dependency on fossil fuels.  Why?  Because we wanted to deal with the issue of climate change, because climate change is existential and we have to start.  The danger was that if we kept on doing oil and gas exploration, we would reduce any incentives to move towards renewables.  That has been the challenge.  No one saw the war in Ukraine coming and the degree to which Europe would have to reduce, very rapidly, its dependence on Russian gas and oil, with countries scrambling all over looking for LNG across the board.<\/p>  <p>  We import the majority of our gas from the UK, which also take supplies from Norway.  Some 75% of our gas from the UK and 25% comes from Corrib.  We have developed well in terms of onshore wind.  We are now on the cusp of a significant development in the context of offshore wind.  Consents have been activated in respect of the east coast.  Auctions will take place, and we will see the first phase of a significant offshore wind energy project getting under way.  That has been assisted by the fact that the legislation around maritime permits and so on was brought through the House last year.  The Maritime Area Regulatory Authority, MARA, has been legislated for, and advertisements for positions in MARA are now under way.  It is envisaged that MARA will be established early next year.  There is a genuine desire, which the Deputy articulated, to move faster in respect of this.  The Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications, Deputy Eamon Ryan, is off that view also.  The EU is of the view that we need to fast-track the permit system.  It is introducing a regulation that will provide for an overwhelming public interest clause.  The latter will override other objections to offshore wind in the interest of the public good in order to get as much offshore wind energy in place so as to permanently reduce and eliminate our dependence on fossil fuels.  All of that is accelerating across Europe because of the war in Ukraine.  People want to reduce, very quickly, their dependence on Russian gas and oil.<\/p>  <p>  Recent developments have been extraordinary.  Russian gas accounts for something close to 10% of requirements compared with what the position was at the beginning of the year.  It has been an extraordinary achievement by the EU.  Gas storage is at 80% or 90% across Europe.  This just shows what can be done out of necessity.

The latest projections from the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, indicate that we are on track to achieve our target of 27,000 home energy upgrades this year.

Go-Ahead Ireland is not alone in experiencing service reliability issues.  The public transport sector has been particularly hard hit by driver shortages as operators attempt to return to the pre-pandemic level of activity, as well as delivering intended service improvements.  The NTA formally meets Go-Ahead Ireland on a weekly basis to review performance-associated customer feedback and driver recovery plans and will continue to closely monitor the situation.  It continues to apply deductions performance payments as part of contracts.  Due to the poor performance during the first half of 2022, the deductions applied were substantial.  Penalties were previously applied to Go-Ahead Ireland in the fourth quarter of 2021 and the first quarter of 2022 amounting to approximately &euro;266,000 and &euro;209,000, respectively.

I also participated in a sustainable development goals-related event on the implementation of the UN global accelerator on jobs and social protection, convened by Mr. Guterres and the Prime Minister of Belgium, Mr. Alexander De Croo.  I took part in a panel discussion on jobs and social protection to recover from overlapping crises.

I also attended a forum of small states reception, hosted by Singapore.<\/p>  <p>  In my statement to the General Assembly, I said that all countries, no matter how small, have a contribution to make to international peace and security and to economic and social development and that all people have the right to live in dignity and have their human rights and fundamental freedoms respected.  I noted, however, that this is not the case for those currently facing hunger and food insecurity, nor is it the case for those in Ukraine who are being bombarded by Russian missiles and for many people in Syria, Afghanistan or Palestine.  I spoke also of the devastating impacts of climate change, which often affects most those who bear least responsibility for its causes.  I cautioned that despite these challenges and their scale, we must not lose faith in the UN or protections that a rules-based international order, for all its shortcomings, provides.  I highlighted the successes that Ireland has achieved working with partners during its current term on the Security Council &ndash; for instance, in terms of humanitarian access to Syria and on ensuring the role of women as peace-builders and agents of change is at the heart of UN peacekeeping and political missions across the globe.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102500018#Q02000","answer":true,"speaker":"1458"},{"type":"speech","time":1666710600,"counter":215,"content":"<p>When speaking at last month's General Assembly, the Taoiseach acknowledged in his remarks that Israeli settlements are a clear violation of international law, that the situation in the occupied Palestinian territory is untenable and that the global community cannot become inured to it.  At least five Palestinians were killed yesterday and 21 wounded in the occupied West Bank after a wave of Israeli forces entered Nablus.  Civilians have described the city as a scene from hell.  Last week, a dozen Israeli soldiers raided a Palestinian home in East Jerusalem to arrest a 16-year-old child, Shadi Khoury.  The soldiers beat him so badly that there was a trail of blood left outside the family home as they dragged him from it blindfolded and barefoot.  He continues to be held without charge.  Shadi's classmates held a vigil for him yesterday, calling for his release.  As Ms Diana Buttu has observed, the international community seems to have a fiction that there is somehow Israel and also the settlements, as though they were separate one another.  In reality, they are one.  This week, a committed settler was appointed army chief in the occupied West Bank, which will serve only to underpin the long-voiced concerns about collaboration between the Israeli army and settlers in attacks against Palestinians.

We have raised it.  UN Secretary General Guterres has praised Ireland.  He pulled me aside at a European Council meeting to thank Ireland for its assertiveness on the Security Council in respect of the Middle East and Palestine.  It is very easy to come in here and throw cheap shots at the Government's position.  We have been very consistent over the last number of decades.  We are one of the few countries in the European Union that has asserted itself in respect of this issue and taken a lot of criticism for so doing, might I add, from different quarters.  That is the reason I put the point to the Deputy.  He needs to let us know what feedback his party is getting from the people they are meeting with and if they raise it with them at all.  I never get any feedback on that.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Boyd Barrett raised that issue as well, including Nablus and so forth.  I met with Mahmoud Abbas recently.  I also met with the Palestinian Prime Minister in London, coincidentally, as we were going to the Queen's funeral.  In my view there is an absolute need to stop the settlements and for a genuine peace process between Israel and Palestine but there is a need for reform within Palestine as well.  We need elections within the West Bank and Gaza.  There has not been an election to the authority in 15 years or more.  That is not satisfactory either.  We made these points.  We need to continue to support the Palestinian Authority, resource-wise, so that it can administer services to its people.  Ultimately, the only way out of this endless saga is to try to get a two-state solution in place.<\/p>  <p>  I do not think that in any way invalidates our condemnation of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which Deputy Boyd Barrett seemed to suggest.  What is going on in Ukraine is beyond condemnation at this stage.  It is incredible inhumanity, in particular the drone attacks on civilian targets and energy security.

Again, Ireland has been to the fore in respect of the global financing of countries in particular those that need supports.  We have been very strong on helping small island states, for example, and their need for adaptation in respect of climate change and how it will impact on them immediately.<\/p>  <p>  We pushed very strongly at COP26 for an agreement and we increased our own contribution to global financing in respect of climate change.  Again at the Security Council, in relation to famine, I reference the work of our diplomats.  They are a young team but they are an exceptional team representing our country.  They were instrumental in maintaining the humanitarian corridor in Syria, which we got passed at the Security Council, despite Russia's reluctance.  That ensures food for millions of people in Syria.  In Ethiopia, the government reduced the number of our diplomats at the embassy in Addis Ababa because of our stance at the Security Council in respect of the war in Ethiopia.  They did not like Ireland standing up and assertively saying what should happen.  We called for a proper peace process and we called for engagement, but that was frowned upon, with the result that our embassy was reduced in numbers.  Ireland has been very effective at the Security Council and we have taken strong stances from a humanitarian perspective.  During our term, in particular, we pushed the role of women in conflict in all of the areas such as Afghanistan and right around the world.  We pointed to the example of significant women involved in reconciliation in Colombia and elsewhere.  We invited them before the Security Council to make presentations.<\/p> <p> Deputy Haughey raised the important issue of reform.  In my view, the United Nations does need reform.  The fact that one of the five members that hold the veto could engage in this kind of wanton destruction of a neighbouring state calls into question the membership of the Security Council, particularly the permanent five, and it injures and undermines the effectiveness and the capacity of the council.  It is in need of urgent reform, and we consistently work on that in terms of broadening the Security Council and its membership into the future.

It does this by bringing economic, societal and environmental impacts together under one framework.  It also places a particular focus on equality and sustaining well-being into the future.<\/p>  <p>  In June, the Government published a second report on Ireland's well-being framework, Understanding Life in Ireland: A Well-being Framework.  This report outlines the longer term approach for integrating the framework into the Irish policymaking system over time.  Alongside the second report, a high-level analysis of the well-being dashboard, which is hosted by the Central Statistics Office, was also published.  This provides a medium-term, holistic view of quality of life in Ireland.  Overall, the dashboard provides a positive picture of the country, as Ireland performs well in 21 of the 35 indicators.  Only one dimension reveals a negative overall picture, namely, the environment, climate and biodiversity dimension.<\/p>  <p>  This year, the well-being framework and the high-level analysis fed into the budgetary process.  It was a theme at the national economic dialogue in June, and the analysis featured in the summer economic statement and as part of budget day documents.  This will now be an annual contribution to the budgetary process that will support a broader discussion of the impacts of budgetary decisions.  Work is ongoing in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform on how to further integrate the framework into policymaking and expenditure decisions.<\/p>  <p>  It is important that further integration is progressed in a measured and coherent way and implemented gradually.  Over time, the framework can help inform policymakers take a more rounded view, based on evidence, of what determines quality of life in Ireland beyond just economic growth.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102500020#S01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1458"},{"type":"speech","time":1666711800,"counter":245,"content":"<p>Ireland's well-being framework is a laudable initiative.  The limitations of GDP as a measurement of a country's progress has long been acknowledged.  As with any initiative, it can be judged only by the positive outcomes it delivers for society.  Like equity budgeting, we have yet to see what tangible benefits and realisation of rights it will deliver.  What impact, for example, will the framework have for people living in residential services for people with disabilities, who contributed to the HIQA report on resident forums published today?  HIQA's report includes the distressing confirmation that residents want to get out of the residential settings and live in the community but there is nowhere for them to live on their own.<\/p>  <p>  On Sunday, my party leader, Deputy McDonald, met Geraldine Lavelle, who, as a result of collision when out cycling nine years ago, suffered a spinal fracture that left her paralysed from the chest down.  After her rehabilitation, Geraldine moved into a congregated setting for what she thought would be a number of months in order to adjust to life with her injury.  Eight years later, she is still there, with no indication of when appropriate social housing will be provided for her.  She rightly believes that everybody needs a place to call home and that segregated settings do not feel like a home.<\/p>  <p>  Frameworks are not worth the paper they are written on if people's lived experiences are not front and centre and if the State's failure to provide for them is not addressed.

I say this as we mark this week the tenth anniversary of the tragic death of Savita Halappanavar.  Of course, since then, we have seen the repeal of the eighth amendment and the introduction of very welcome abortion legislation in this jurisdiction.  The announcement yesterday by the UK's Secretary of State for Northern Ireland that the British Government would commission abortion services is welcome but also long overdue because women have for so long been denied access to basic healthcare.<\/p>  <p>  I was glad to attend today the timely launch by the National Women's Council of Ireland of the new report Every Woman, setting out an overview of access to reproductive healthcare and choice for all.  This report highlights the continued gaps in abortion healthcare, even in this jurisdiction.  We in the Labour Party put forward a submission to the public consultation on the review of our abortion laws in March, calling for the repeal of the three-day waiting period and for better geographic coverage so that women in all counties can access services.<\/p>  <p>  I was glad to launch the conference of the Southern Taskgroup on Abortion and Reproductive Topics, START, on 1 October.  START is a group of doctors providing front-line services that was initiated by Cork-based GPs, obstetricians and gynaecologists.  Doctors are seeking to ensure there is a stronger network across the country, and we are seeking to ensure strengthened access to reproductive healthcare once the review has concluded.

Shockingly, the person who owns this property, who the residents estimate is probably making an annual income of about &euro;700,000 a year, is trying to claim financial hardship as a justification for a mass eviction, which just tells us about some of the landlord class in this country.<\/p>  <p>  The residents - I put this to the Taoiseach, as we have done with St. Helen's Court in D&uacute;n Laoghaire and other cases where tenants have faced eviction through no fault of their own - are asking that the State step in and buy that block to ensure there is no mass eviction of these tenants.  That should be a systematic policy pursued by the Government.

I am not familiar with the case in its entirety.  I agree, however, that the more independent living services and facilities we can provide, the better.  As the Deputy knows, we have different opinions from time to time in terms of closing residential care or evolving people from a residential care environment or integrated care setting to a home care setting.  This approach has often created challenges for the services, particularly in terms of chronically sick young people or young people who, for a variety of reasons, have disabilities arising from accidents and so forth.  There was a need for a resourced home care-based approach or independent living-based approach, which has been developed over a long period.  I do not have the specifics of the case but the principle of facilitating independent living is accepted.  Resources have been allocated on an annual and incremental basis.  I am not familiar with this individual case.  The Deputy stated that eight years have passed and that an appropriate setting has still not been provided, which is not satisfactory for that person.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Bacik raised the issue of access to woman's reproductive services and the work of the National Women's Council of Ireland, which published a report earlier.  I outlined previously in the House, in the past week or so, where we are on that in terms of the Minister's various initiatives from a research strand to a consultation strand.  That is nearing completion.  I will voice the opinion in the interim that there is an obligation on the HSE and all maternity hospitals to provide access under the Act.  I am concerned that some hospitals have still not done that.  I accept that there can be individual conscientious objections, but it is then a matter for the hospital or the HSE to provide enough resources to accommodate this in given situations in order that there is a maximum of access to legally available services in the State.  I will raise the issues raised by the Deputy with the Minister for Health.  However, I did outline to Deputy Bacik last week the exact timelines for the review of the legislation that is under way and that will come to finality fairly soon.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Barry raised the issue of retrofitting.  I do not know if the Deputy was in the Chamber during the Order of Business.  I am told that the article is not correct.  I have been informed by the Department that  29,000 have actually been completed.  They are on target in terms of the retrofitting of homes.  The article's reference to a figure of 89 related to a specific scheme involving the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, which was only started in February.  It is achieving its targets, however.  In fact, applications were up 150% this year after the announcement of the new scheme.  It is very much on target.  We must accelerates the numbers even further in order to meet the 2026 target, which is very high indeed.  I will get those figures for the Deputy as they were presented to me.  The note I received indicates that the article was mistaken and incorrect.  It is certainly not reflective of the progress that has been made.  I also heard it being quoted this morning on radio.  Apparently, it is an incorrect article based on incorrect information.  I stand to be corrected if that is the case but I think we need to bring clarity to it.  The Department gave me that information.  This is difficult for the Deputy; he made a presentation based on the article.  I am told it is not grounded in the reality of what is happening, however.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Boyd Barrett raised a specific issue.

Last week the Minister, Deputy Coveney, said that Ireland will participate in the EU's training mission for the Ukrainian army expected to get under way in mid-November.  It is very clear that this is the next step in the Government's determined effort to involve Ireland in European and eventually NATO military undertakings.  It comes alongside the fact that the Irish Government has now participated in five meetings of the Ukraine contact defence group, a group described by the US Secretary of Defence as a NATO alliance, a body which meets at the NATO headquarters at the US air base of Rammstein in Germany.  It comes alongside the escalation of Ireland's involvement in PESCO and the provision of military equipment to Ukraine.  The Government is doing all of this in open defiance of the wish of an overwhelming majority of people to remain neutral from all of the imperialist military blocs that are a scourge on the people of the world.  It is also doing it without any vote under Article 28 of the Constitution which states clearly that the State shall not participate in any war save with the assent of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.

These are workers at TotalEnergies and Exxon Mobil who dared to strike for 10% wage increases after TotalEnergies gave a &euro;2.6 billion dividend to shareholders and Exxon recorded its largest quarterly profits ever.

I take huge issue with the response of the Iranian ambassador and renew my call on the Taoiseach.  How can we maintain relations with a country that treats its own people in such a way, and that is so intent on spreading misinformation about what is going on in Iran?  We know that there have been protestors who have died.  We understand some 244 protestors have died including 32 children.  We have seen reports of arrests of so many people for protesting for basic rights and women and girls that Iran has run out of jail cells.  We are seeing of course also Iran continuing to provide kamikaze drones to Russia that are being used to bomb civilian infrastructure in Ukraine.

As regards fundamental rights, like Deputies Bacik and Brady, I also wish to ask the Taoiseach about the current situation in Iran.  The death of Mahsa Amini following her detention for failing to wear a hijab has sparked widespread protests.  There has been a disproportionate response to these protests and a number of protestors have been killed, as we have heard.  There are also concerns about the safety and wellbeing of the Iranian athlete climber Elnaz Rekabi.  Now it appears that Iran is supplying drone weaponry to Russia for deployment in Ukraine.

The death of a number of women and girls and the underlying human rights situation for women and girls in Iran stand to be condemned.  It is of deep concern.  The Minister, Deputy Coveney, has twice raised the specific case of Mahsa Amini and the unjustified response to peaceful protestors directly with the Iranian Foreign Minister and has called in the Iranian ambassador.  He has also raised with the Iranian ambassador concerns for the safety and welfare of Elnaz Rekabi, the Iranian rock climber who could face charges in Iran for not wearing a head scarf while competing at an event in South Korea.  Iran's supply of weaponry to Russia, which Deputy Haughey referenced, is directly contributing to violations of international law.  Last Thursday the European Union adopted additional targeted sanctions to add three Iranian individuals and one entity involved in the development and delivery of drones to Russia.<\/p> <p>More will be added in the coming days.<\/p> <p> The fundamental question of diplomatic relations applies to many states that engage in practices we do not approve of, but diplomacy is the last channel remaining to try to persuade people to do differently and to articulate our concerns, consistently raise issues and, into the future, try to develop channels to get a change in how people practise.  It is a matter of the gravest of considerations to end diplomatic relations, particularly in a context where we decided only in more recent times to restore diplomatic relations with Iran and given we are working in the context of the UN Security Council on the nuclear file, endeavouring to get the six-party treaty in place, and get Iran, the US, the EU and so on involved in denuclearising any potential for nuclear weapons in Iran.  Keeping our diplomatic channels open is very important to the realisation of our goals as members of the UN Security Council, especially since we were responsible for the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, JCPOA, file at the Council.<\/p> <p> I must take issue with Deputy Murphy's point.

This year's Bill sets out the legislative provisions to bring effect to the tax measures announced in budget 2023, which is a cost-of living budget that underlines the Government's commitment to help individuals, families and businesses to deal with the challenge of rising prices.  The Bill implements a range of targeted tax changes, including specific measures to support families and businesses and to address the many challenges facing our society, including housing and climate change.  It also contains a number of administrative changes to the tax code, reflects recent international developments and seeks to protect and enhance the integrity of our code of taxation.  I look forward to bringing this important legislative instrument through the Oireachtas over the coming weeks.<\/p>  <p>  To help families, individuals and businesses deal with the rising cost of living, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy McGrath, and I have announced a package of one-off measures worth &euro;4.1 billion.  They are accompanied by additional budgetary measures for 2023 worth &euro;6.9 billion.  This brings the total size of budget 2023 to &euro;11 billion.  In addition, there is a further &euro;300 million in public service support measures funded from the National Surplus (Exceptional Contingencies) Reserve Fund.  I appreciate these are very significant figures.  However, I also appreciate the needs of families and businesses are very significant.  The strength in tax revenues, particularly domestic tax revenues, has provided us with the additional means to undertake such a response.<\/p>  <p>  One of the core objective in budget 2023 is to ensure workers do not find themselves in a position where they pay more income tax solely because of inflation.  There are many people who work hard but whose earnings push them outside of access to any additional support from the State.  We need to help them too.  We need to put money back into their pockets.  On budget day, therefore, I announced an income tax package to the value of more than &euro;1.1 billion.  I am increasing the standard rate cut-off point by &euro;3,200 to &euro;40,000, with proportionate increases for married couples and civil partners.<\/p>  <p>  I am also increasing the main tax credits for personal, employee and earned income credit by &euro;75.  I am increasing the home carer tax credit by &euro;100 to support stay-at-home parents.  The basic personal tax credit available to married persons and civil partners who are jointly assessed to tax will increase from &euro;3,400 to &euro;3,550.  In all other cases, the value of the tax credit will increase from &euro;1,700 to &euro;1,775.  The value of the home carer tax credit will be increased from &euro;1,600 to &euro;1,700.  The value of both the employee tax credit and earned income tax credit will also increase from &euro;1,700 to &euro;1,775.  Where an individual is entitled to both the employee tax credit and the earned income tax credit in the same year of assessment, the aggregate of credits available to him or her under the two provisions will not exceed &euro;1,775.  Furthermore, I am increasing the second universal social charge, USC, rate band of 2% from &euro;21,295 to &euro;22,920 in line with the 80 cent per hour increase in the national minimum wage.<\/p>  <p>  Housing continues to be one of the biggest challenges facing the country and a whole-of-government approach is being taken to address this challenge.<\/p> <p>In the Finance Bill, a number of provisions will make their contribution to this challenge, including the rental tax credit of &euro;500, changes to the help-to-buy scheme, and changes to the pre-letting expenses regime to assist landlords preparing properties for rent.  The introduction of the vacant homes tax and changes to the residential zoned land tax aim to increase the supply of homes for rent and purchase.<br\/><br\/>Also in the property sector, I am providing for a defective concrete blocks levy to raise some of the funding required for the defective concrete blocks grant scheme.  Following the announcement of this levy on budget day and in light of subsequent comment on the measure, I have determined that the rate at which the levy will apply will be halved from the planned 10% to 5%.  The move will come into effect on 1 September 2023 as opposed to 3 April 2023.  This will allow all parties more time to prepare for its introduction.  I have also reduced the range of products to which the levy will apply.  This Finance Bill provides that the levy will apply to pouring concrete and concrete blocks under two harmonised EU standards.  It will not apply to precast concrete products.<br\/><br\/>As I have said, the Government appreciates the challenges that businesses are facing with significant increases in electricity and gas costs.  These challenges come on top of Brexit and the Covid-19 pandemic with the necessary public health restrictions and closed premises.  Therefore, I am introducing a temporary business energy support scheme, TBESS, to provide appropriate support to businesses during the winter months.  When I announced the scheme on budget day, it was to apply, at that point, to tax compliant businesses carrying out a case I trade.  This has been extended and the Bill provides that it will also apply to those carrying out a case II profession.  The scheme will also apply to new businesses, and eligibility for relief in such cases will be calculated using a deemed unit price provided by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI.  This will be based on data provided by suppliers and the Commission for Regulation of Utilities, CRU.  A monthly cap of &euro;10,000 per trade or profession will be applied.  However, in certain circumstances qualifying businesses that operate across more than one location and that have multiple meter point reference numbers may qualify for increased relief.  In such cases, the monthly cap of &euro;10,000 may be increased to a maximum of &euro;30,000.  The scheme falls under the European Commission temporary crisis framework, TCF, and is subject to state aid approval.  As I announced on budget day, it is intended the scheme will operate in respect of energy costs relating to the period 1 September 2022 to 28 February 2023.  However, pending revision of the TCF, which is expected to occur by the end of this month, it was not possible to provide for an end date to the scheme beyond 31 December 2022.  I hope to amend the legislation on Committee Stage to include the 28 February end date after the anticipated amendment of the TCF.<br\/><br\/>Another regulation under discussion at European level is the agricultural block exemption regulation, ABER.  There are a number of budget proposals that are dependent on the outcome of these negotiations.  These include the introduction of the provision for accelerated capital allowances for the construction of slurry storage, and the extension of a number of agricultural tax measures due to expire at the end of December 2022.  Again, and subject to the outcome of negotiations, I would hope these can be addressed by Committee Stage amendments.  The provisions relating to the key employee engagement programme, KEEP, will also be addressed during the passage of the Bill.  As I indicated at budget time, the clear intention remains to legislate, through amendments introduced on Committee Stage, so as to provide for the buy-back of KEEP shares by the company from the relevant employee and to raise the lifetime company limit for KEEP shares from &euro;3 million to &euro;6 million.<br\/><br\/>I now turn to the contents of the Bill itself.  It is a substantial Bill, running to more than 200 pages.  The first sections deal with income tax items, some of which I discussed earlier.  I draw Members&rsquo; attention to section 6, which provides for the increase in the small benefit exemption to &euro;1,000 and the increase in the number of vouchers from one to two.  Members will recall this measure was introduced by financial resolution on budget night and therefore takes effect in the current tax year.<br\/><br\/>Section 4 deals with the Covid-19 related lay-off payment.  This payment is intended to plug the gap for employees who lost the opportunity to accrue reckonable service due to lay-offs caused by the Covid-19 public health restrictions.  Statutory redundancy payments are exempt from income tax, and therefore these Covid-19 related lay-off payments will also be exempt from income tax.<br\/><br\/>Section 7 extends the benefit-in-kind exemption to cargo bicycles and e-cargo bicycles by increasing the threshold to &euro;3,000.  This is a further fulfilment of a commitment in the Programme for Government: Our Shared Future to provide an increased proportionate allowance for e-bikes and cargo bikes.  The changes will apply from 1 January 2023.<br\/><br\/>Deputies will recall that a number of tax exemptions are not currently reported to Revenue.  Section 8 provides for the automatic reporting to Revenue in respect of three specific measures that are made without the deduction of tax.  These are the remote working daily allowance of &euro;3.20, travel and subsistence expenses and the small benefit exemption to which I referred earlier.<br\/><br\/>Section 9 gives effect to the budget announcement to increase the standard rate band and a number of tax credits  from 1 January 2023.<br\/><br\/>Section 12 introduces a new &euro;500 tax credit for renters, with each tax-paying tenant in a particular property being eligible for the credit in their own right.  The credit is aimed at, and will be only available to, renters who do not receive State housing supports.  The credit will also be available in certain circumstances to parents who pay rent on behalf of their student child who is in third level education.<br\/><br\/>Sections 16 and 17 provide for the taxation and relief rules for the pan-European personal pension product, PEPP, which has been introduced as required under Regulation (EU) 2019\/1238 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 June 2019.<br\/><br\/>Section 20 provides for an exemption of up to &euro;20,000 from income tax for certain profits arising from the production, maintenance and repair of certain musical instruments. These instruments are early Irish harps, Irish lever harps and uilleann pipes.<br\/><br\/>Section 25 increases the cap on allowable pre-letting expenses from &euro;5,000 to &euro;10,000, and reduces the minimum period for which a property must be vacant from 12 months to 6 months.<br\/><br\/>Section 34 extends the final date when films can be certified as qualifying for the film corporation tax credit from 31 December 2024 to 31 December 2028.  This amendment will be commenced at a future date, subject to EU state aid approval.<br\/><br\/>Section 37 confirms the budget changes to mineral oil tax rates to come into effect from 12 October 2022, and provides for further rate changes to come into effect from 1 March 2023.  The section provides for the extension of reductions in certain mineral oil tax rates which were introduced earlier in 2022.  Provision was made in the Finance (Covid-19 and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2022 for these rate reductions to be reversed from 12 October 2022.  The reversal of these reductions will now be implemented from 1 March 2023.The section also provides for increases in mineral oil tax rates, as set out in Schedule 2 of Finance Act 1999, on auto fuels, effective from 12 October 2022.  These rate changes arise from increases in carbon charge rates, as set out in Schedule 2A of Finance Act 1999, which came into effect on 12 October 2022.<br\/><br\/>Section 38 provides for the budget increases in the rates of tobacco products tax of 50 cent on a pack of 20 cigarettes in the most popular price category, on a VAT-inclusive basis, with <i>pro rata<\/i>increases on other tobacco products.<br\/><br\/>Section 44 provides for the extension of the 9% VAT rate on the supply of electricity and gas until 28 February 2023.<\/p> <p>Section 47 provides for the reduction of the flat rate addition for farmers to 5%.<\/p> <p> Section 55 provides for the zero rating of VAT on newspapers, including e-newspapers, certain period products, non-oral hormone replacement therapy medicines, non-oral nicotine replacement therapy medicine and automated external defibrillators.<\/p> <p> The Bill makes a number of amendments in respect of stamp duty, including clarifying aspects of the higher stamp duty rate of 10% charged where a person acquires 10 or more residential units in any 12-month period.<\/p> <p> As I announced in the budget, the bank levy will be extended for a further year and will only apply to those banks that will continue to operate in the Irish market, going forward.  This means that the levy is expected to generate in the region of &euro;87 million in 2023.<\/p> <p> With regard to capital acquisitions tax, section 65 of the Bill makes a number of amendments to the Act of 2003 to take account of recent amendments to the Succession Act 1965 made by the Birth Information and Tracing Act 2022.<\/p> <p> Section 67 provides an exemption from tax for any payments made under the Covid-19 death in service scheme for healthcare workers.<\/p> <p> In the miscellaneous provision section of the Bill, section 84 provides for a new vacant home tax, VHT, to be introduced in 2023.  The measure aims to increase the supply of homes for rent or purchase, rather than raise revenue.  The VHT will be self-assessed and administered by the Revenue Commissioners and will apply to long-term habitable vacant residential property that is subject to local property tax, LPT.  The bill will be paid by property owners.  A property will be considered vacant for the purposes of the tax if it is occupied for fewer than 30 days in a 12-month period.  The first chargeable period will commence on 1 November 2022 and the owners of vacant properties will be required to file a return in November 2023.  Payment of the tax will be due on 1 January 2024 at a rate equal to three times the property's base LPT rate.  It will be in addition to LPT.<\/p> <p> The Bill also provides for a number of exemptions to ensure property owners are not unfairly charged for temporary vacancy arising from genuine reasons.  This will include properties recently sold or currently listed for sale or rent, properties vacant due to the occupier's illness or long-term care and properties vacant as a result of significant refurbishment work.  The measure seeks to achieve an appropriate balance between incentivising owners of vacant homes to bring their properties back into use and not penalising homeowners for normal, temporary vacancy, with the primary objective of the tax being to change behaviour rather than raise revenue.<\/p> <p> Section 86 provides for the defective concrete block levy.<\/p> <p> Sections 87 to 90 deal with the temporary business energy support scheme, TBESS, and there are the usual technical amendments and care and management sections.<\/p> <p> The Bill sets out the legislative provisions to bring effect to the tax measures announced in the budget.  It is a cost-of-living budget that underlines, as I said, the Government's commitment to helping individuals, families and businesses to deal with the rising cost of living and the rising cost of doing business.  The Bill implements a range of targeted tax changes, including specific measures to support individuals, families and business.  I commend the Bill to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102500023#V02900","speaker":"1558","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1666714800,"counter":309,"content":"<p>T&aacute;im bu&iacute;och as an deis seo labhairt ar an Bhille Airgeadais, 2022.<\/p>  <p>  There is no doubt but that our economy and society are faced with another crisis.  Following on from the financial crisis, Brexit and a global pandemic, we have been thrust into an energy crisis that threatens living standards and will test the resilience of our economy and society.  This is all set against a backdrop of failures in housing and healthcare that continue to test the patience of households, their security and hopes for the future.<\/p>  <p>  Households have seen the largest income shock fuelled by inflation in a generation, resulting in the biggest fall in living standards since the financial crash.  While a squeeze on living standards driven by high housing and other costs predated the war in Ukraine, Russia's illegal invasion turbocharged inflation.<\/p>  <p>  The Department of Finance has outlined its expectation that inflation will reach 8.5% this year and 7.1% next year.  In real terms, that means that somebody earning a &euro;35,000 salary will see his or her purchasing power drop by more than &euro;5,000 next year compared to last year.  That is a significant drop in living standards.<\/p>  <p>  Inflation has been driven by rising energy prices with households having faced a wave of price hikes in the past year and the most recent round of price hikes effective from this month.  Sinn F&eacute;in argued for a time limited price reduction and cap on household electricity bills for the winter months until February to provide certainty and relief to households.  Unfortunately, the Government rejected this proposal, a measure that has been introduced in several other European countries in recent months.<\/p>  <p>  The centrepiece of this Finance Bill to address the cost-of-living crisis is an increase in the entry point to the higher rate of income tax, bringing it to &euro;40,000.  A key issue at the heart of any budget decision is whether it is fair and whether it is the best use of taxpayers' money.  Sinn F&eacute;in called for an income tax package that would cut the lower rates of USC, ensuring the benefit was spread fairly and evenly across households so that high income earners did not benefit more than those on middle and low incomes, as they will do under the Government's proposal.  That is the path that was pursued by the Government.<\/p>  <p>  Section 9 of this Bill provides for an increase in the entry point to the higher rate of tax, which will cost more than &euro;800 million but leave more than 2.2 million income earners out in the cold.  Some 77% of income earners will not benefit from this measure.  Someone with an income of &euro;35,000 will benefit by &euro;191 from changes to income tax and USC while someone with an income of &euro;100,000 will benefit by &euro;831.  This, by any measure, is an unfair use of public resources because there was, and is, a fairer way which Sinn F&eacute;in has outlined.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome a number of provisions in this Bill.  The recent changes made to annex 3 of the VAT directive expanded the list of goods and services which could be reduced to zero rates of VAT from now on.  I welcome a number of the provisions in Part 3 of this Bill that will zero rate a number of goods from next year, including automated external defibrillators, certain non-oral medicines and menstrual products.  Section 44 extends the reduced 9% rate of VAT applied to electricity and gas from the end of October this year to the end of February next year.  This is a measure that Sinn F&eacute;in has called for since last year and I welcome the extension.<\/p>  <p>  As households are all too aware, the cost of running a car, travelling to work, visiting sick relatives or filling the tank with home heating oil has risen sharply in recent times.  The price of diesel has again shot up to over &euro;2 per litre, while the price of petrol is now over 40% higher than it was last year.  Section 37 of this Bill provides for further reduced rates of excise applied to petrol and diesel until the end of February but the Government opposed Sinn F&eacute;in's amendments that would have reduced the price of petrol at the pump by a further 15 cent per litre and the price of diesel by 12 cent per litre, bringing it back below the &euro;2 per litre mark.  The Government voted against that amendment, denying households much-needed relief in their transport costs and we will again, through this Finance Bill, encourage the Government to do the right thing and reduce the cost of petrol and diesel by the maximum amount allowable under the EU rules, with the suspension of the fuel rebate alongside it.<\/p>  <p>  It is unfortunate that the Government has once again ignored the concern of the one third of households that use home heating oil and have seen its cost increase by 84% in the past year.  Instead of using this opportunity to provide these households with relief by reducing the rate of excise which applies to home heating oil, the Government will instead increase the rate again from May, according to this Bill.  This is part of the Government's continued drive to increase the cost for households in heating their homes and running their cars through further hikes in carbon taxes, which are regressive and hit those on lower incomes hardest, lone parents and those in rural households.  In an era of high inflation, now is the wrong time to increase costs to households and the focus must turn to delivering on the alternatives and supply-side investment that households need.<\/p>  <p>  Turning attention to housing, it is clear that the Government's housing plan is failing dramatically.  Housing commencements are again beginning to fall.  House prices have smashed the Celtic tiger peak.  They rose by more than 12% in the past year, while supply of rental accommodation has collapsed, with rents spiralling and increasing by 12% in the past year.<\/p> <p>The average rent right across the State now is nearly &euro;1,500 and in Dublin it is &euro;2,000.<\/p> <p> The human reality behind these numbers is one of insecurity, homelessness, desperation and of emigration.  Renters hand more of their hard-earned pay packet over to their landlords each year under this Government.  College students are sleeping in cars, on sofas, commuting long journeys or deferring their courses because they cannot find accommodation under this Government.<\/p> <p> The number of people in homelessness has reached record levels under this Government, while homebuyers continue to be locked out of home ownership.<\/p> <p> It is now performing screeching U-turns to contain the fallout of their abject failure by adopting measures that Sinn F&eacute;in has been calling for for years and one of them is contained within this Bill.  The Government&rsquo;s U-turn on an eviction ban is a case in point but this measure is needed, and needed now, and should have been introduced quite some time ago.  <\/p> <p> Having opposed Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s proposal for a tax credit for struggling renters for years on the grounds that it would be a transfer of public money into the pockets of landlords, which are the words of the Minister for Finance, and where the Taoiseach said it would increase rent prices; section 2 of this Bill crafted by the Minister for Finance indeed contains a rent tax credit.  I am glad that the Minister is seeing sense but, unfortunately, he is making a balls of it because instead of just doing a U-turn, he is doing what he warned about in the first place, which is putting money into the landlords&rsquo; pockets.  We needed not just a renters&rsquo; tax credit but a ban on rent increases.  That was the crucial point in a two-part proposal by Sinn F&eacute;in, that is, a renters&rsquo; tax credit which would have put a month&rsquo;s rent back into renters&rsquo; pockets - as opposed to the &euro;500 proposed - but ensuring also that landlords would not just jack up prices by having a ban on rent increases.  <\/p> <p> Perhaps in the future, just like the Government is seeing the light in the ban on evictions and a renters&rsquo; tax credit, in a couple of months&rsquo; time the Minister might come around to the sensible idea that he also has to have a ban on further rent increases.<\/p> <p> The housing crisis is first and foremost driven by the failures to deliver social and affordable housing at scale.  Instead, the Government has implemented measures which increase demand, when the demand is already white hot and supply stone cold.  As a result of affordability issues in the mortgage and housing market as a result of Government failure, the Central Bank has responded by loosening lending rules, which it admits will pump up further credit into the market, will increase house prices and will risk undermining the resilience of borrowers.  It is doing that because of the affordability issues resulting from Government failure.<\/p> <p> Section 5 of this Bill provides for an extension of the help-to-buy scheme in its current form for another two years.  There are no amendments at all to the scheme, despite warnings from a Department-commissioned report that over half of the successful applicants already had the 10% deposit, and with the level of dead weight associated with this relief averaging 48% since its introduction.  <\/p> <p> Sinn F&eacute;in has called for years for the introduction of a vacant property tax to end the scourge of vacancy and dereliction in the face of an acute housing shortage.  Section 48 provides for the long-overdue introduction of a vacant homes tax and while I welcome this U-turn from the Government, it took long enough for it to get here, I have concerns regarding its design and what it omits.  By restricting it to properties with a local property tax liability, the Government excludes derelict properties entirely.  <\/p> <p> The Minister may refer to the derelict site levy but this levy is not working and everybody knows that.  In many instances, it is not even being collected and is an issue to which my colleague, Deputy Gould, has brought repeated attention in this Chamber and outside of it.  If the vacant homes tax is to bring properties back into use, derelict properties must be addressed.  The tax proposed remains unchanged in its rate of charge, regardless of how long the property remains vacant, be it one year, two years or indeed ten years, and I believe there is scope to increase the rate, as the length of time that the property remains vacant increases.<\/p> <p> Section 86 of the Bill reaffirms the Government&rsquo;s plan to press ahead with a flawed and counter-productive defective concrete products levy.  In the context of hard costs making up 48% overall of the cost of housing delivery, where the cost of concrete has increased by almost 40% in the past year and with the need to drive down construction costs to accelerate delivery; this levy as designed will directly increase building costs and house prices, which is something, in fairness, the Minister does not deny.  This will push up prices for homebuyers, rather than putting the cost on to the profits of the industry itself and on the banks, which will also benefit from the redress scheme.  It is time to drop this levy and to go back to the drawing board.<\/p> <p> Our domestic exporters and SMEs who provide employment and opportunity across the State face energy costs that threaten their very viability.  In advance of the budget, Sinn F&eacute;in proposed a suite of measures which would provide them with support, including a scheme which would cover a portion of the increase in their energy bills, with appropriate limits and safeguards in place.  Sections 88 to 90, inclusive, provide a temporary business energy support scheme and I welcome the Government's introduction of this scheme to support businesses with rising energy costs.  For many, however, this support will not be enough to offset the very significant increases they are seeing.<\/p> <p> Having gone through the experience of State supports during the pandemic, there must be a better way to provide enhanced, targeted and tailored support to those who need it most.  This scheme as drafted takes no account of profitability or revenue.  For instance, the same criteria and limits are applied to the local restaurant or butcher as apply to a highly profitable business with large cash reserves.  We need to revisit these sections on Committee Stage to safeguard the viability of our small firms.<\/p> <p> I also urge the Minister to learn the lessons from the pandemic to ensure that safeguards are in place in order that highly profitable companies, for example, do not avail of taxpayers&rsquo; money by distributing dividends to shareholders.  <\/p> <p> As my time is up, I will give way now to my colleagues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102500025#X00200","speaker":"1462","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1666715400,"counter":311,"content":"<p>As I only have four minutes, I will only focus on one particular measure but I look forward to engagement on Committee Stage.<\/p>  <p>  I want to focus, therefore, on the vacant homes tax.  It is something which we have long been calling for and is something which, on the face of it, most people would probably welcome.  We know that we have a significant stock of vacant homes, which we can see from just going through our towns, cities and rural areas.  These number 166,000 according to the recent census.  We know this adds to scarcity but also creates an artificial scarcity of supply, which helps to drive high prices and rents.  <\/p>  <p>  We also know that tax schemes for vacant homes has worked well in other countries.  It has brought stock back into use while generating revenue to re-invest in vacancy and dereliction.  On the face of it then, this measure should be welcome but unfortunately, here the devil is again in the detail.  The Government's stated intention is to incentivise those with idle property to bring it into use.  But if that is the intention, then why design it in such a way as to make it so avoidable?<\/p>  <p>  Two legal experts have described this tax as &ldquo;significantly compromised, to the point it could be considered virtue-signalling.&rdquo;  If we have a quick look at it, we can see that the tax is done on a self-assessed basis and that it would not apply to residential properties occupied for more than 30 days in a 12-month period.  <\/p>  <p>  But whether this is 30 consecutive days or not is not clear.  Would it not be easy for the owner of this property to just say it is a holiday home, that they come and go for more than 30 days of the year, and then, hey presto, the owner is not liable for this tax?  By remaining silent, would this still permit a situation where short-term letting could occur and then with the right planning, would the property still not fall liable for this tax?  Again, that is not clear.<\/p>  <p>  Nor is it clear how Revenue will be checking tax compliance.  Will it use the GeoDirectory data, the latest census or some other method?  If we were serious, the first thing I would have expected to see was some big anti-avoidance clause jumping out at me from this particular measure, that is, some big deterrent that said to those thinking of deliberately dodging their tax obligations that there would be serious consequences<\/p>  <p>  There is also the fact that the charge itself is too low and does not increase with each subsequent year.  The levy will be approximately 0.3% of the value of the property and does not automatically increase every subsequent year.  In France, for example, the rate is 12.5%, which then doubles the following year.  When the French introduced their tax in 1998, vacancy fell by 13% over the next four years leading to a significant increase in supply.  We should contrast that with what we see here.  Accountancy firm Deloitte recently noted that the impact of the Minister's tax measure on increasing supply would at best be \"modest&rdquo; and from looking at this, I can easily see why.  We can see from the Revenue forecasts how much tax it expects to generate from this and it is estimating that around &euro;3 million to &euro;4 million will be brought in over the year.  If one considers that an average-priced house would pay around &euro;945 per annum, then at the lowest bands of the Revenue's estimate of &euro;3 million raised, this would equate to around 3,200 liable homes.<\/p> <p>That is simply not good enough.  If this tax was a boat, it would have so many holes in it that it would not be able to sail from Malin Head to Mizen Head.  I will seek to thrash that out on Committee Stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102500026#Y00200","speaker":"1579","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1666716000,"counter":313,"content":"<p>I thank the Cathaoirleach Gn&iacute;omhach for the opportunity to say a few words.  I only have a few minutes so I will focus on supports for businesses in the face of the energy and cost-of-doing-business crisis.  The difficulties Irish businesses are currently facing are felt most acutely by SMEs and family businesses, those that were that were hardest hit during the Covid pandemic.  In the main, these are businesses that have really been through the mill over recent years.  Their costs have risen across the board.  This is for a variety of reasons but is mainly due to increasing energy costs and the impact these have had on inflation.  Businesses have tried to remain agile.  If the Minister speaks with business owners, he will know, as I do, that many of them are doing their very best.  They are trying to adapt to the changes, in some instances by absorbing the increased costs to try to remain competitive.  Naturally, this has an impact on SMEs and family businesses whose margins are often very tight.  However, in the long run, this may prove to be unsustainable for many.<\/p>  <p>  The temporary business energy support scheme announced on budget day and legislated for here is welcome.  Businesses eagerly await its introduction.  The legislation indicates that the scheme will go further than was announced on budget day and will include tax-compliant businesses that carry on a trade or profession chargeable under case I or case II of Schedule D, including self-employed individuals, companies and partnerships.  The explanatory memorandum says that \"Charities and sporting bodies who carry on certain activities which would be chargeable to tax under Case I or II of Schedule D but for an available exemption are also included in the scheme.\"  On this point, will approved housing bodies be eligible to apply for supports?  Clarification from the Minister would be very much appreciated.  Will energy supports for senior citizens' organisations or other such charities come through the Minister's Department or will they be delivered through another mechanism or Department?  <\/p>  <p>  Has the Minister engaged directly with small businesses that are concerned the new scheme will not be enough to help them with their energy costs?  Did the Government give any consideration to a targeted scheme to support the maintenance of the employment relationship between worker and employer as a means of supporting affected businesses or is it the case that this move would be beyond the scope of the flexibility that currently exists under EU state aid rules?  I ask because many businesses and stakeholders have indicated that in addition to energy costs, costs that have increased due to inflation, including the cost of transport, fuel, stock and insurance, are also causing difficulty.<\/p>  <p>  I thank the Acting Chair for allowing me time to speak on this.  If the Minister cannot answer my question, I hope he will be in a position to provide me with a written response.  Like me and many others, I believe the Minister was angered to see those companies that came through the Covid pandemic while in receipt of substantial supports to keep them afloat during that crisis subsequently paying out dividends to their shareholders and reporting significant profits.  This underlines the need for serious targeted measures to be introduced.  Everybody is being impacted to some degree by the cost-of-living and cost-of-doing-business crisis.  No household is insulated from it.  However, some people will experience it to a different degree than others.  There are some businesses that, while viable, are now vulnerable and concerned about having to compete for supports with businesses that are well able to absorb some of those costs.  I ask that the Minister give consideration to the amendments that will be put forward on Committee Stage to include more targeted measures.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102500027#Z00200","speaker":"1467"},{"type":"speech","time":1666716000,"counter":314,"content":"<p>I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak on the Finance Bill.  This legislation gives effect to many of the substantial proposals announced in budget 2023 in late September.  This summer saw the longest run-in to a budget in many years at a time of great uncertainty and anxiety.  In many ways, budget 2023 flattered to deceive.  It is worth remembering that, even with the expenditure of an additional &euro;11 billion between this month and 31 December 2023, this Government will have managed to widen the gap between the rich and the poor by &euro;199.  That is not my analysis but the analysis of Social Justice Ireland.  We are dealing exclusively with the Finance Bill today but, for completeness, we must look at all of the budget measures in the round.<\/p>  <p>  This is the time of the year when we get to see the political colour of a government's money.  It is true that, with &euro;4.1 billion to be spent between now and the end of the year in addition to the resources already committed, many of those who rely upon the State will receive significant once-off cash support to help them through to the end of the year.  A lump sum and double payments are a good way of using our social protection system to target money where it is needed most.  However, when these once-off measures are gone, they are gone.  In early January, when the sugar rush wears off, budget 2023 proper will reveal itself to be what I and independent commentators know it to be, a conservative budget.  As the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, has said \"Compared to indexing tax and welfare policies in line with inflation since 2020, Budget 2023 leaves households worse off on average.\"  Increases to tax credits and welfare payments that are below forecasted inflation will see many lower-income households experience real-term cuts to their living standards unless there is a repeat of the lump sum, double week and energy credit payments, poorly targeted as they are, in the middle of next year.  <\/p>  <p>  These are the facts.  In other words, if you are poor today, you are going to be poor this time next year.  Budget 2023 is merely designed to get people through the next few months and we will see where we are then.  There is no vision as to how to make the structural changes to our economic and welfare model that we need to take as many as possible of the 600,000 people experiencing poverty in this country out of that serious situation.  Nobody is claiming that that any budget or government can completely insulate all of our citizens from the worst effects of the cost-of-living crisis but we can do better than budget 2023 has managed.  <\/p>  <p>  We are living through an unprecedented time and the only thing of which we are certain is uncertainty.  Our best guess is that our economy will continue to grow next year, albeit at a slower rate.  Inflation is likely to be at approximately 8% next year.  Tax revenues will continue to roll in at high rates, although we cannot and should not take anything for granted.  Wages will rise but for lower and middle-income earners in the everyday economy, those wage rises will not come anywhere close to matching the rising costs of energy, rents, mortgage interest rates, transport and food.  Against this backdrop, it is frankly inexcusable that core weekly social welfare rates will not go up by the &euro;20 they need to if they are to beat or at least match inflation.  The purchasing power of those who are most in need will fall off a cliff.  It is absolutely inevitable that we will be back here in February or, more likely, March to debate new spending measures to address these issues.  Mark my words; that is going to happen. <\/p>  <p>  When I speak of those most in need, I do not only mean those on social welfare but also those who get up early in the morning and work hard all week.  The Finance Bill gives effect to the personal tax changes announced in the budget.  Some 67% of the &euro;1.26 billion allocated for personal taxation measures will benefit higher earners only.  In order for the proposed tax changes to even have the appearance of being more fair, a decision could have been taken, for example, to taper off credits for those earning in excess of &euro;100,000, clawing back some of the benefit for higher earners.  What is the practical effect of these tax changes?  Someone with an income of &euro;100,000 will gain approximately &euro;900 a year.  However, people earning between &euro;25,000 and &euro;35,000 will gain less than &euro;200.  By no definition is that fair.  To put this in clear terms, the budget and, by extension, this Bill provide the least for the very large cohort of workers earning between &euro;15 and &euro;20 per hour.  That is a fact and it is very hard to reconcile with the rhetoric we often hear from the T&aacute;naiste and others about supporting the squeezed middle.  These workers are the very definition of the squeezed middle.  I note the changes made with regard to the application of the 2% rate of USC for those on the national minimum wage, which are a good thing, but we should note that PRSI thresholds remain unchanged.  This has the effect of slightly increasing the PRSI burden on a full-time minimum wage worker as the reduced rate threshold for those earning less than &euro;424 is not changing.  The Labour Party's own analysis shows that, in a worst-case scenario, many minimum wage workers could immediately lose 30% of their increase while those on a full-time wage of &euro;19,000 per annum may lose 35%.<\/p> <p>This is simply scandalous.  It is unconscionable that the Government, which put so much stock in raising the tax bands for higher earners in budget 2023, could simply disregard this cohort of workers.  I ask that the Minister and the Minister for Social Protection take a closer look at that issue in the context of this Bill and the Social Welfare Bill.<\/p> <p> On the matter of personal taxation, I again ask the Minister to re-examine the question of tax liabilities for PAYE workers who enjoyed the benefit of the pandemic unemployment payment and the temporary wage subsidy scheme, TWSS.  The demands are coming through the door.  This could not come at a worse time for working people.  It is jarring that the Finance Bill proposes to extend the special assignee relief programme for high rollers moving to Ireland to work with foreign direct investment firms, but someone whose industry was out of action during the first wave of the pandemic or whose employer had to claim the TWSS is left with a tax bill.  These earners are likely to be on lower incomes and they are the most exposed to the cost-of-living crisis.  I ask the Minister to look again at writing this liability off and absorbing that, especially given the current climate.  Approximately 300,000 workers have yet to file tax returns.  This amounts to a total of &euro;219 million.  Some TWSS beneficiaries are on the hook for up to &euro;2,500.  This bill would more than wipe out any benefits they might get from this year's budget.<\/p> <p> We very much welcome the expansion of the special benefits exemption scheme.  It is positive that, as a result of a resolution in the D&aacute;il on budget night, workers can benefit from that expansion this year.  That is covered in section 6.<\/p> <p> The next section relates to the benefit-in-kind arrangements for cargo bikes.  That is a welcome measure.  When considering the question of benefit-in-kind, I ask the Minister to reflect on the timing of imminent changes to the application of benefit-in-kind to company cars.  I have received a lot of contact on this matter, as have many Deputies over the last few weeks.  If that change proceeds as planned, it will have a very serious impact on the incomes of those who have company cars for their work.<\/p> <p> The energy crisis dominates everything these days.  It is more than evident that businesses require assistance with their energy costs in order to keep operating and to maintain employment.  Section 88 of the Bill provides for the introduction of the TBESS.  The State will spend up to &euro;1.2 billion between now and the end of February on the scheme, and it will inevitably have to be extended.  In some ways, its poorly targeted nature reminds me of the way in which the domestic energy credit was designed.  The local Centra that needs the support will get it but the Facebook data centre is also eligible.  That may not happen.  It may not be applied for.  It would be quite perverse if it was.  However I, note that all case I and case II businesses will qualify for the TBESS.  If it is legally tricky to exclude energy-hungry data centres from the scheme, for example, then the Government should impose an extra levy of &euro;10 per megawatt hour on their unit cost for electricity.  This would more than claw back any benefit gained by any errant data centre that did apply for the scheme.  The very idea that they are capable of applying and will be permitted to apply for the scheme does not sit well with people.  This is a sector where electricity demand has tripled since 2015.  Figures provided to me by the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications show that the levy of &euro;10 per megawatt hour could see us claw back &euro;40 million in revenue, which could be used to help domestic businesses and users across the economy and society who need additional support.<\/p> <p> While we understand the need for short-term cash injections to help businesses with their energy costs, I have two fears about the operation of the scheme.  The TBESS does nothing to help control the overall cost of energy.  That is why the Government should push at EU level to cap the price of wholesale gas used to produce electricity.  It should use the example provided by Spain, Portugal and elsewhere that appears to be working quite well.  The second concern is this.  One Louth retailer told me last week that even with the TBESS he is still having to pay &euro;90,000 more this year in energy costs.  Jobs will be lost.  That &euro;90,000 is the equivalent of three to four full-time jobs in the retail sector.  That is why we need also need an energy wage subsidy scheme to keep people in work as the energy crisis hits.  It is inevitable that jobs will be lost in the teeth of this crisis.  I repeat my consistent appeal for the creation of a new German-style short-time working scheme to address these issues.<\/p> <p> As we all know, housing is the single biggest social, and arguably economic, issue facing our country.  Housing for All is a failing policy and no amount of spin will change this.  It will not meet its targets this year on social housing, affordable housing or even in the development of private housing.  There are a combination of housing-related measures in the Bill, all of them well-intentioned on an individual basis.  However, they are piecemeal given the extent of the supply problem and the fact that the housing budget announced on budget day will go up by only 1% next year from a capital point of view.  Construction inflation has gone up 14% in the past year.  This is a real-terms cut in the capacity of the system to build more social and affordable homes.  As a result of the very modest measures on the capital side in this budget, fewer public and affordable homes will be built than even under the Minister's inadequate plans.<\/p> <p> The vacant homes tax has all the hallmarks of a token tax.  In the end it will only apply to a small minority of vacant homes, maybe about 4,000, and the rate at which it is set means it will be relatively easily absorbed.  On that basis, it simply will not disincentivise vacancy.  A tax of &euro;300 or so a year will not put too many people who have vacant homes off, especially as prices continue to rise, albeit at a slower rate.  Let us be honest about that.  The most efficient and sustainable way of providing decent housing quickly, addressing the scourge of dereliction and reviving town centres is to bring vacant homes and derelict sites back into use.  As a start, the Labour Party proposed in our costed alternative budget a new vacant homes tax, initially set at &euro;500 per unit.  That would be open to reconsideration every six months based on how the market responds.  This rate and the operation of the system should be kept under frequent review as regards its performance in bringing homes back into use.<\/p> <p> The resources generated by the kind of tax the Labour Party is proposing and a new vacant sites levy, coupled with better enforcement of existing derelict sites powers, could then be ring-fenced to allow local authorities to do the job they need to do in maximising their capacity to inspect vacant homes, register vacant sites, compulsorily purchase and transform those properties into habitable homes.  Louth County Council did very good job a couple of years ago in bringing many vacant homes into use by using existing powers under its compulsory purchase order capacity, as provided for in law.  That can be done but it is not done to a sufficient degree across the country.  This is the low-hanging fruit.  We should be bringing these homes back into use to ensure people who need homes are housed in an efficient and sustainable way.  Sadly, there is no such ambition, or that level of ambition, from the Government to get the simple things on vacancy and dereliction right.  All we need to know about that lack of ambition is reflected in this tokenistic vacant homes levy.<\/p> <p> Section 6 extends the help to buy relief for a further two years.  This is a temporary relief that is starting to look a lot more permanent.  We are well aware of the assessments made by independent commentators and analysts, and even by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, on the effect of the relief on the market.  We are also aware of the view of the ESRI and others that the help to buy scheme has had an inflationary effect on the price of housing.  This is not the smartest public policy tool ever invented by any Government but clearly the Government is intent on sticking with it.  It is undoubtedly a popular incentive and it is being used.  All of the evidence shows that.  The Minister is sticking with this proposition and that is reflected in the Bill.  It will again be extended.  As a critic of the scheme, I will be so bold as to make a suggestion.<\/p> <p>Would the Minister consider extending eligibility, with conditions, for access to the scheme for those who may be divorced or who are legally separated?  This matter is been raised with me on a number of occasions in recent weeks.  In cases of a relationship legally ending, court orders will in many instances have required the sale of a family home.  I am sure that conditions could be attached, or the level of aid permitted under the relief scheme could be adapted, to take any financial settlement into account.  I have no doubt that the scheme could be altered to take account of this very human reality for many thousands of people.<br\/><br\/>As the Minister is aware, the new mortgage rules announced last week by the Central Bank have acknowledged this situation.  Those who are divorced or legally separated will, from 1 January, now be considered first-time buyers.  This is the right thing to do. Perhaps other policies and initiatives could take inspiration from this socially just move that was made by the Central Bank last week.<br\/><br\/>There are a couple of other issues I would like to cover.  The Minister has reviewed his position on the concrete levy.  This is a good thing.  We are aware that any levy to be introduced in respect of poured concrete will inevitably be added to the price of homes.  The Labour Party has argued - and costed in our alternative budget - that we should be examining instead the idea of a 2% tax on the profits of the construction sector.  This would minimise the risk of any levy being passed on to first-time buyers.  As we understand it, a measure like this has been deployed in the UK.  For those construction industry operators who resisted it, restrictions were placed on their ability to trade and obtain planning permission.  We need to look at something similar.<br\/><br\/>Inevitably, there is going to have to be a contribution by the construction sector to deal with the mica redress scheme and the construction defects in people's apartments.  We are aware that up to 100,000 apartments are affected.  As part of its alternative budget, the Labour Party would have provided &euro;500 million to get a start on the mica redress scheme and on assisting those people who are living in defective apartments to address their needs and begin the resolution works that need to be undertaken.<br\/><br\/>It is good that the Minister has decided to abolish VAT on newspapers.  This is a critical measure to protect the media and the critical role they play in our democracy.  The abolition of VAT will help.  Unfortunately, however, for many newspaper groups across the country, it may be too little too late.  As we speak, local newspaper groups are making staff redundant.  This is the case with the predominant newspaper group in my constituency, namely, that which publishes the <i>Drogheda Independent<\/i>.  There are also issues for local radio broadcasters.  It is not a matter for the Finance Bill but is strictly a matter for the Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media, Deputy Catherine Martin.  I hope this is something the Minister will consider.<br\/><br\/>I will make a narrow, parochial appeal.  The living city initiative has been in place for several years.  It is working reasonably well.  It covers the main cities, and it covers Kilkenny also.  It continues to exclude larger towns in the country such as Drogheda and Dundalk.  Drogheda is an especially historic town with an architectural heritage that needs to be protected.  If we are to deal with dereliction and vacancy, the living cities initiative should be extended to towns that are larger than Kilkenny and equally as historic.  I hope this is something the Minister will consider in due course.<br\/><br\/>I look forward to working with the Minister on Committee and Report Stages to enhance and amend the Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102500027#Z00300","speaker":"1599","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1666717200,"counter":317,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for coming to the House today.  I was listening to this debate upstairs before I came down to the Chamber.  Over the past few weeks, post budget, there has been a lot of commentary in respect of the decisions that were taken in advance of this Bill.  I ask Members to think back 12 or even 24 months and consider the position we were in and the uncertainty presented by Covid.  Pre pandemic, we were concerned at what might be happen post Covid.  It exemplifies the position of the Government and the decisions that have been taken over the past few years and how difficult they were for taxpayers, for businesses, for employees and for the country.  In these debates, we sometimes lose sight of that.  To be fair to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath, and to the Minister for Finance, the budget presented a number of weeks ago surpassed many people's expectations, if we take into account the past 24 months of Covid and the pandemic.<\/p>  <p>  I will just raise a couple of issues that are close to my heart.  The VAT exemption on defibrillators, which will come into effect from 1 January 2023, is an issue on which I campaigned for a long time, even before I came to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  I lost count of the number of motions I put down at various county council meetings over the years on this matter.  I welcome this development.  I am aware that a number of community and sporting groups across the State will welcome this initiative.<\/p>  <p>  I must also mention the temporary business energy support scheme.  I have listened to the debates on this, and for certain people this scheme will not go far enough.  I have listened to those people suggest that it is not going to go far enough, but then they paused and did not progress on to what they would do.  While the temporary business energy support scheme might not be enough, and particularly for larger businesses or for larger consumers of energy, I still believe it is an initiative to be welcomed.  Once it is up and running it will give some kind of certainty to businesses and give them some clarity as to what they can expect in Government support.<\/p>  <p>  The third issue I wish to mention is the benefit-in-kind.  The Minister will be aware that I have been beating the drum about this for a number of weeks now.  I am like a broken record.  For me, this benefit-in-kind initiative, albeit legislated in the Finance Act 2019, comes down to an issue of timing.  When people are facing increasing costs as regards energy and travelling to and from work, I am not sure that early 2023 is the time to be putting it in place.  I hope this will be reviewed again in the new year.  I will make that call again.<\/p>  <p>  I must also mention the defective concrete products levy.  Again, this is an initiative that I had spoken out against over the past number of weeks.  I welcome the compromises that have been reached, and I welcome that the levy will be reduced from 10% to 5%.  I also welcome the various exemptions that are being considered.  Ultimately, however, this is again about timing.  We are facing a budgetary surplus this year.  I ask the Minister and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform to question the timing of this measure.  A recent meeting of backbenchers of my party agreed that we understand and agree with the principle behind it.  We are not arguing against that, but again it comes down to the crucial aspect of timing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102500029#BB00200","speaker":"1521"},{"type":"speech","time":1666717200,"counter":318,"content":"<p>I congratulate the Minister on the Second Reading of the Finance Bill.  The recent budget is very important when we look at the context, as my colleague has said.  Twelve months ago, we never imagined that we would be in a position of this kind, whereby not only would we not have a deficit but that we would have a surplus leading into next year.  This has given great scope to be able to respond to the challenges that exist.  Times are really tough and people need more money in their pockets.  The budget will enable us to provide them with that through reductions in tax, increasing the national minimum wage and, where we can, increasing public sector wages.  This will give people more money when they need it in order to be able to deal with the increases in their energy bills that are a consequence of the war in Ukraine.  It is a significant intervention.<\/p>  <p>  I have heard calls for more to be done.  Of course, everybody wants more to be done because we are politicians representing our constituents and this is what we do.  If we look at the UK and the installation of yet another new Cabinet, we have learned and seen very clearly the consequences of a different budgetary approach.  I refer to a reckless budgetary approach that has no regard for sustainability and that cannot be relied upon by the citizens of that country.  Those mistakes have to be fixed very quickly.  Although I am sure they will be fixed quickly, they come with huge reputational cost to a country that had built up such a strong reputation over time, notwithstanding our disagreement with it about Brexit.  The UK had a strong reputation over time for being a stable political entity and a stable political institution.  There is a valid salutary lesson for us in managing our budgetary processes as we have done and in being able to provide for people when they need it, as happened during Covid and as I hope will happen, insofar as is possible, in the context of the rising costs of energy.<\/p> <p> I commend the significant tax policy changes.  They constitute an important step to give people more of their own money back at this time in an inflationary cycle.  It is an important measure to set a tone that we want to do that.  We have not been able to do that for many years.  It is important that people have discretion about how to spend their money and, particularly at this time, it was important to take a step towards giving more people control over their spending and more tax back.  I would like to see that continued into next year, where possible, because people need discretion over their money, particularly middle income workers, who have been hardest hit in many respects.  I congratulate the Minister on the Finance Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102500029#BB00300","speaker":"1480","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1666717800,"counter":320,"content":"<p>The test of any budget is whether the lives of the people of the State will be improved as a result.  In the context of tax measures, there was a need for a reduction in USC but that was not delivered.  We see zero-rating of certain VAT products.  That is welcome.  Hopefully, the savings will be passed on, most crucially, to workers and to the guests staying there.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of transport, the measures are unfair on those under financial pressure.  A further tax increase will affect Kerry residents who have to drive to work or use solid fuel for heating and does little for those least able to pay.  Now is not the time to increase costs.<\/p>  <p>  In housing and facilities, we see an increase of 7% in the amount allocated to water services and capital spend is up from &euro;876 million to &euro;932 million.  The Right2Water movement was clear on the need to pay for water services from general taxation, something the Government was eventually forced to accept.  However, the Government is being dragged kicking and screaming towards Sinn F&eacute;in housing policy in circumstances where rents, house prices and homelessness are increasing.  The eviction ban is welcome but belated.  There is a type of rent tax credit, but we needed a rent increase ban.  We also need more social housing to combat the years of austerity.<\/p>  <p>  Some of the programmes behind the overall spending allocation are incredibly important to Kerry's future.  One of those is the rural water programme.  According to the budget, this additional funding is being made available to support a new programme for water services for villages not on the public network.  This is a massive issue in Kerry because many parishes do not enjoy proper wastewater services, access to a public water network or properly treated drinking water.  Places like Glenbeigh, Castlegregory, Annascaul and Abbeydorney will not see any new developments of housing - affordable, social or otherwise.  An extra &euro;5 million is simply not enough under the scheme.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, there are bodies of water in Kerry suffering from discharges.  A recent Environmental Protection Agency report stated that a number of waterways in Kerry face a severe biodiversity challenge, with one third above moderate levels of pollution.  This is not good enough and I have called for Irish Water to carry out assessments in Cromane, the Maherees, Tralee Bay, Valentia and the Kenmare River.  I welcome the &euro;3 million provided to meet requirements under EU water quality directives but it is not enough.  Major capital investment is needed to solve the issue, especially in water treatment plants.  I call on the Government to ensure this is completed in Kerry as soon as possible.<\/p>  <p>  I had a conversation with a butcher from Kerry today who said he paid 11 cent per unit of electricity in 2019, 19 cent in 2020 and is currently paying 40 cent per unit.   He is paying &euro;4,000 per month and has  a skeleton crew working six days per week.  Every customer is affected, as are the 30 butchers in his craft butchers' section.  What he wants, has asked for and needs is a cap on energy prices.  He does not want the type of smart answers we got from the Taoiseach today during Leaders' Questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102500030#CC00200","speaker":"1488"},{"type":"speech","time":1666717800,"counter":321,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Finance Bill.  It is always good to have time and space between the announcement of the budget and the consideration of the Finance Bill because it gives an opportunity to clear away some of the fog and spin and to understand exactly the impact of the budget provisions.<\/p>  <p>  One of the most disappointing aspects of budget 2023 is its permanent distributional effects.  I have heard more than a few Government Deputies and a couple of Ministers say this is a progressive budget rather than a regressive one.  I do not accept that, though there may be enough one-off payments to create the impression that the most vulnerable are being taken care of.  There is &euro;500 here and &euro;200 there for certain groups.  That is welcome and all very well but one thing is for sure: the permanent effects of budget 2023 will not be progressive.  How can they be?  An increase of &euro;12 per week for those on social welfare, including pensioners, is about &euro;624 per year for some of the most vulnerable in our society.  They are the people who, as the CSO has pointed out, are being worst hit by the cost of living crisis.  Contrast that with the benefit of &euro;830 per year for someone earning &euro;100,000 once all the income tax and USC changes are taken into account.  How is that progressive?  How is it progressive to give energy credits to everyone regardless of housing income or to give an effective double payment of energy credits to anyone sufficiently well-off to own a holiday home?<\/p>  <p>  This budget could have done so much more to target its benefits.  There is &euro;500 for recipients of disability loans but no permanent cost of disability payments, something for which people with disabilities have been calling for years.  There is a &euro;400 payment for fuel allowance recipients but no permanent increase to the payment, leaving them with great uncertainty for the year ahead.  There is &euro;500 for recipients of the working family payment, which is all very well, but there is no extension of the fuel allowance to that group.<\/p>  <p>  These supports are all very well but will not help people in the medium to long term or provide certainty for those who need long-term supports the most.  They will not provide sustainable relief to those who can no longer afford the soaring prices for necessities like food, fuel, energy and rent.  There are a number of one-off payments for many of those reliant on social welfare but the only people with any certainty for the future are those in the upper income brackets, who can be sure their tax cuts will be there in future years.  Apparently, the Government plans to give them even more.<\/p>  <p>  One of the things I found most notable about budget 2023 is the extent to which the Government's income tax cuts went so far beyond what had been flagged in the lead-up.  The increase in the standard rate cut-off point is so out of proportion to what current circumstances justify that it can only be explained by ideology.  Eight hundred million euro in 2023 on a tax cut that will be of no benefit to anyone earning less than &euro;37,000 per year.  This cut will cost more than &euro;1 billion in a full year: this is a change that will only benefit approximately 20% of workers.  How can that be fair?<\/p>  <p>  I accept that some indexation of tax bands is warranted to keep the portion of income taxed at the higher rate roughly consistent, but there is little justification for the kind of indexation seen in the previous two budgets.  That does not stop Government Deputies trying.  In his budget speech, I heard the Minister again pushing the misleading idea that inflation leads to people paying more income tax.  It does no such thing.  People pay additional tax when they get salary increases.  Wage growth has been far lower than general inflation.<\/p> <p>How the Government can justify indexation of nearly 9% this year and of more than 13% over the last two budgets when the latest available numbers from the CSO suggest average weekly wages are only increasing at less than 2.5% a year is really beyond me.  The Social Democrats proposed a third rate of tax of 43% on incomes above &euro;100,000 but there is no interest from this Government in making any effort to claw back any of that gain from those at the very top.  I cannot understand how any Government Deputy can justify a situation, particularly in the present circumstances when so many people are in crisis situations, that there is that level of tax break for the best earning people in this country, that is people earning &euro;100,000.  How can there be any justification for giving them a tax break and no effort whatever to create a sense of fairness and to achieve fairness by introducing any kind of clawback?<\/p> <p> On energy supports, a failure to target supports is a recurring theme with this Government.  Budget 2023's energy supports for households are a further example of this.  More than &euro;1 billion in supports has been pledged but households with large incomes will get just as much support as those with small, inadequate incomes.  The excuse that it is too complicated to target low and middle income earners just does not wash.  What has the Government been doing in almost one year since this kind of energy credit scheme was first proposed?  Maybe it could have been excused to have a universal approach at the outset because the priority was to get money to people quickly.  But to repeat the same exercise after so much time has passed where a more targeted approach could have been worked out is simply not good enough.  If you are earning the minimum wage, you get &euro;600.  If you are earning &euro;100,000 you get &euro;600.  If you happen to own two homes you get &euro;1,200.  The Social Democrats alternative budget proposed a system based on the temporary Covid-19 wage subsidy scheme, TWSS, used during Covid which would have allowed targeted payments to be processed in an efficient manner.  It is very disappointing that the Government did not seem to pay any attention to taking this kind of fairer approach.<\/p> <p> Another issue around energy is the failure to realise the potential of solar energy.  The Government is way behind the curve on this.  The grants are much too small and the impact of VAT on solar panels needs to be examined.  I will request that a report is commissioned on this and I will move an amendment to that effect on Report Stage.<\/p> <p> On business supports, at least it has been figured out how to target resources at the small and medium sized companies that need support to pay their energy bills.  The proposed scheme mirrors proposals that my party made in its alternative budget which provided &euro;1 billion for an energy crisis support scheme for business.  It is important to remember that unlike the Covid crisis when wages needed to be supported the current crisis necessitates viable but vulnerable businesses being supported in paying their energy bills.  The Government must learn the lessons of the mistakes it made in its Covid response to business.  It must ensure that companies that avail of this support do not pay dividends to shareholders, do not make staff redundant and if it transpires that they did not need state support to remain profitable, there should be a clawback option.  The purpose of this support is job protection.  We want to ensure that businesses remain viable and trading.  We do not want to inflate profit margins or waste money by handing it to businesses that are clearly unviable.<\/p> <p> Turning to housing, as I said some weeks ago immediately after the Ministers&rsquo; budget speeches, it is deeply concerning that the Government thinks that its tax on vacant homes is anything close to sufficient.  It is, in fact, pathetically low.  Three times the level of the local property tax may sound like a serious move until you realise that it amounts to 0.3% of the value of the property.  How is that supposed to act as a disincentive to vacancy or dereliction when property prices are rising at multiples of that rate?  It reads to me as an astounding statement of indifference to the problem of vacancy and a determination to maintain the status quo.  The Social Democrats proposed a 10% tax on vacant homes with exemptions, of course, to be fair to people who have legitimate reasons to have their home empty, such as care or health reasons.  We will submit an amendment to this effect.<\/p> <p> If the Government is serious about tackling the issue of vacancy it must do much better than this.  It needs a penal tax on vacant homes in order to unlock the huge potential that is there, particularly in the context of the housing crisis that we have at the moment.  Consider all the commentary on vacancy and dereliction impacting the centre of Dublin and the Dublin Central constituency, the O'Connell Street general area and stretching into the north inner city.  The same points apply to the centre of Cork.  I had the opportunity to travel around the centre of Cork and see the extent of vacant homes.  It is actually immoral at this stage to allow a situation like that in the context of a housing crisis where people are sitting on properties waiting for them to disintegrate and waiting for an opportunity to knock them and replace them with whatever commercial development.  It should not be allowed.  We need a penal tax that would stop that continuing.<\/p> <p> While Fianna F&aacute;il holds the housing brief, recent news that Fine Gael TDs are holding meetings to brainstorm on the housing disaster is surely further evidence of the desperation within the Government and the lack of confidence that even Government TDs have in the Housing for All policy which is dismally failing to meet even its own very anaemic targets.  The rhetoric suggests that the Government is taking it seriously; the output does not.<\/p> <p> It would be unfair not to acknowledge that there are a number of welcome moves in budget 2023 which will help to reduce the cost of living for those who are struggling.  The reductions in childcare fees, the free provision of schoolbooks for primary school pupils and the abolition of inpatient charges in public hospitals our chief among those measures that have to be warmly welcomed, but the overall trend of investment in public services is worrying.  As the Social Democrats constantly points out, if you really want to reduce the cost of living and give working people and families, particularly those with young children a break, it makes more sense to use the majority of available resources to invest in better quality public services and social infrastructure.  This also requires that investment in public services at the very least keeps up with inflation.  However, the Parliamentary Budget Office and the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council have calculated that about an extra &euro;7 billion per year is needed to meet inflationary costs and to allow public services just to stand still.  As far as I can see, this budget allocates less than half of that figure.  This has huge implications for public services in 2023 and beyond and the impacts will be felt in the further erosion in the availability of vital supports.<\/p> <p> It says a lot about this Government's priorities when you consider three key points.  First, that the Government was so determined that income tax be indexed in line with inflation, despite there being absolutely no justification for that.  Second, that those dependent on social welfare must accept increases well below the level of inflation.<\/p> <p>Third, public services will be very negatively impacted because their funding increase is well below inflation also.  In fact, as I said a month ago, it seems the overall theme of this budget is erosion of the tax base, with a consequent reduction in the money available for public services over the medium to long term.  This just cannot continue.<\/p> <p> The Government must chart a course towards the sustainable funding of our public services.  We know this country needs more revenue to improve service delivery, look after an ageing population and meet its environmental targets.  That is why the Government set up the Commission on Taxation and Welfare.  However, having outsourced the job of finding the revenue, we all acknowledge we need to have an independent commission made up of experts from all fields of society.  The immediate response from some Ministers to findings that do not fit their ideology has been to politicise and dismiss this work before giving it any proper consideration.<\/p> <p> The reason the commission was necessary in the first place was that Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael, in government, have for so long refused to accept the need for revenue to increase as a proportion of national income.  Those same parties like to poke fun at the supposedly unsound policies of the left, but independent expert groups, from the Commission on Taxation and Welfare to the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, have consistently pointed out how these parties are asleep at the wheel when it comes to accepting fiscal realities and future-proofing our finances.  Budget 2023 continues this trend.  There is no concrete plan to reduce increasing overreliance on corporation tax receipts.  There have been no updated costings for Sl&aacute;intecare in the past five years, despite the inflation in that period.  There are no proper costings of planned climate measures and no real ambition in this area.  With windfalls being used to fund current spending, this Government has no overall financial plan and, it has to be said, not much credibility.<\/p> <p> I have a point on the minimum wage.  The Technical Group recommended that the living wage be increased to &euro;13.85 to achieve a socially acceptable standard of living.  The poor increase in the budget is widening the gap between what the minimum wage is now and what the living wage needs to be.  Again, that is a very regressive move.  It is widening the gap between the better-off and those on low pay and dependent on the living wage or minimum wage.  The Government is not setting out a clear path to introducing a realistic living wage.<\/p> <p> This point also applies to the difficulty we have in recruiting key staff, particularly in home care.  The strong recommendation in the report of the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, on this matter is that, at a minimum, the living wage be the standard one.  If we are serious about ensuring we have enough home care staff to meet the substantial care needs, we need to include the living wage in the tendering process for home care services.<\/p> <p> The budget sounded very good in that it seemed to entail Government largesse.  However, when we examine its detail, we see those most in need got least whereas those who are most comfortable and earning the most got long-term, secure increases in their incomes.  That is simply not progressive and it certainly is not fair.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102500030#CC00300","speaker":"1567","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1666719000,"counter":324,"content":"<p>I thank the House for the opportunity to contribute to this important debate.  I look forward to contributing at more length when the Bill is before the finance committee next month.  I welcome the Bill.<\/p>  <p>  When we had statements on the budget, I said it was progressive and welcome.  There are many areas in the Bill that will genuinely be of benefit to so many around the country as they face extremely worrying challenges due to the difficult global circumstances, be they associated with Putin&rsquo;s war in Ukraine, rising energy costs or the many other factors.<\/p>  <p>  There are one or two aspects of the Bill I would like to highlight and on which I ask the Minister to reflect.  We might see a little more clarity in the latter Stages before the Bill is finally enacted.  The first issue, which has been raised with me quite a number of times by constituents in recent weeks, concerns benefit-in-kind tax on company cars.  There may be a discrepancy in this regard.  We need to differentiate between those who receive a company car as a gift or bonus, or as recognition in lieu of further payment, and those who receive one because it is an integral part of their job.  The latter do not necessarily drive commercial vehicles, vans or jeeps but are on the road.  My late father was a rep on the road for 35 years.  His car was not a luxury car; it was his office.  It was where the old-fashioned car phone was, and the samples were in the boot.  It contained the files, contact directory and old-fashioned Filofax that were brought around when meeting customers and clients across all 32 counties of this country.<\/p>  <p>  Regarding those who receive a car as a gift from their employer, there needs to be differentiation.  The increase in the tax such people pay on their vehicles is making a huge difference to their bottom line.  It is completely undermining any benefits from the budget.  A rep I spoke to, who lives in Ballinteer in my constituency, said that to compensate for the tax increase, his salary would need to go up by 15%.  That is the difference it makes.  Those who travel longer distances, whose area may be all of Leinster, or Dublin and south Leinster, are suffering a lot more than those who may cover only the Dublin metropolitan region or some such region.  Their cars are as essential to their jobs as their laptops or desks.  Is there some way in the application of the new benefit-in-kind tax that was announced to distinguish between company cars given as perks and cars used for work?<\/p>  <p>  There is another small issue I would like to raise.  I do not have a direct ask but want to raise this in the brief amount of speaking time I have because it merits serious consideration.  It relates to the proposed changes regarding a benefits tax, including the working from home daily allowance and the payment of travel expenses.  Small businesses across the country have raised serious concerns regarding why they were not consulted on these changes.  I urge the Minister to see what can be done to engage directly with small businesses and their representative bodies before this Bill is enacted.  We all know about the need to support small businesses.  In parallel with meeting this need through the Finance Bill, we need to meet it by opening up the training opportunities of our SMEs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102500032#EE00200","speaker":"1473"},{"type":"speech","time":1666719000,"counter":325,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Finance Bill, which underpins many of the budget announcements made last month.  It is a progressive budget, despite what some commentators would say.  It is wide-ranging and well thought out, and it provides immediate support to many people throughout the country when they need it most.  It also offers core support for the future.  It exemplifies the Government&rsquo;s approach to how we dealt with the Covid crisis over two years.  We support businesses and people in a crisis.  We are in a cost-of-living crisis at the moment, and this budget deals with it.<\/p>  <p>  We have a steady and stable Government comprising the only three parties that were willing to form a Government at a most difficult time, during a pandemic, when others ran around the country telling people in Trump-type rallies that they had actually won the election.  We resisted the reactionary call from across the benches.  The Members opposite wanted us to react with an uncosted and ill-thought-out mini-budget and then try to apply an uncosted energy cap.<\/p> <p>We have seen the dire results of that across the water.  It just goes to show that it is good to have three parties that work well together and a Minister for Finance and Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform who are willing to take their time and to deliver a budget that will deliver and is delivering for people out there.<\/p> <p> I spoke about examples like the lump sum for the fuel allowance, the living alone allowance, the working family payment and the carer&rsquo;s allowance, the double payment for child benefit and the weekly welfare schemes, and the assistance for students and for their parents.  Other items were able to continue through this budget as well, such as the very substantial and significant cuts to transport fares.  They are real cost-of-living benefits that accrue to students, younger people and to their parents.<\/p> <p> The Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, Deputy O'Gorman, introduced a 25% reduction in childcare costs.  It is the most significant State intervention in childcare costs in the history of the State, and we will go further next year.<\/p> <p> I hear many people across the House criticising the retrofitting scheme.  I refer to the comments today of Adrian Joyce, the secretary general of EuroACE and campaign director for Renovate Europe.  He described Ireland as Europe's best designed energy renovation programme.  The scheme is just starting so I ask members of the Opposition to give it some time because there is an energy crisis and we are delivering.  We will roll out the retrofitting scheme.<\/p> <p> I will speak briefly on section 84 - the vacant homes tax.  I welcome its introduction.  It is the first time ever we have had a tax on vacancy, and it is something we must do.  We have a lot of vacant houses.  The commentary ranges from somewhere between 160,000 to a much lower figure.  It is not that simple, clear or straightforward to bring those vacant homes into use.  They are not all suitable for accommodation.  There are many reasons for vacancy in this country.  This is the start of it.  I do not think the figure for the vacant homes tax is high enough, but I will seek to introduce amendments on Committee Stage to try to increase it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102500032#EE00300","speaker":"1626","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1666719600,"counter":327,"content":"<p>There are 166,000 vacant homes in the State.  The Government&rsquo;s plan to tackle this is to bring in a levy of 0.3%.  It looks like a joke, but it is so serious that it would be wrong to do so.  The Minister has completely failed to tackle vacancy.  Once again, Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael and now their partners, the Green Party, cosy up to the vulture funds, the land hoarders and the people who are sitting on homes where people should be living.<\/p>  <p>  In France, for instance, a phased vacant homes tax was introduced, starting at 10% and ending at 15% of the potential annual rent.  It resulted in a 13% reduction in vacancy rates in four years.  If we were to follow the French example, that would mean more than 21,000 vacant homes would come back into use.<\/p>  <p>  In my constituency of Cork North-Central, there are areas where vacancy is so high that one in 15 homes is vacant.  These are homes in the heart of the city and there should be families and people living in them.  Now, we are talking about some of these homes being left empty.  Some of the homes are owned by local authorities.  I know of a family who left a home last December and the house was boarded up this week, ten months later.  I knew that house.  I was in it.  It was a perfect home that a family should have been living in for the past ten months.<\/p>  <p>  I have heard about the vacant homes tax and the Government&rsquo;s plan in that regard.  Does the Minister sincerely think a vacant homes levy of 0.3% will work?  It cannot work.  It makes no sense.  How can we compare that with the 7% derelict sites levy?  Less than 0.5% tax is paid for a vacant site but a derelict site is set at 7%.  It just shows the complete lack of understanding about it.  We need a proper vacant homes tax.  We need a carrot-and-stick approach.  We must encourage landlords to get those houses into use, and where they do not, we must penalise them to get them to do that.  It is being said this is a progressive budget, but there is virtually nothing in the budget when it comes to solving the housing crisis and the homelessness crisis.<\/p>  <p>  The Glashaboy flood relief scheme is ongoing.  It has been promised for the past ten years.  Glanmire flooded again last weekend, ten years after this was promised.  The problem is that when it comes to construction inflation and tendering increases, it has to go back out for tender again.  Last year, funds of &euro;14 million were put in place, but because of inflation, the cost has gone up to &euro;17 million.  Once again, the scheme has not been delivered.  For years this Government has promised flood protection for Glanmire.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102500033#FF00200","speaker":"1453"},{"type":"speech","time":1666719600,"counter":328,"content":"<p>The Deputy is over time at this stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102500033#FF00300","speaker":"1617"},{"type":"speech","time":1666719600,"counter":329,"content":"<p>Glanmire needs protection and the money must be delivered.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102500033#FF00400","speaker":"1453"},{"type":"speech","time":1666719600,"counter":330,"content":"<p>There is a lot of stuff to deal with in the Finance Bill.  It is a big document.  We will no doubt tease through a lot of it in more detail on Committee Stage.  It is a telling fact that, faced with an unprecedented cost-of-living crisis and a shocking, disastrous, catastrophic &ndash; you just run out of adjectives to describe how bad the housing crisis is &ndash; housing crisis, the ESRI and Social Justice Ireland were before the Committee on Budgetary Oversight, of which I am a member, and they stated unequivocally that if we strip out the once-off measures of cash payments, which occur primarily before Christmas, and some of the other once-off measures, the budget is regressive.  That is not the left saying that; it is the ESRI and Social Justice Ireland.  They were very clear.  In real income terms, people on social welfare payments, pensions, students, and workers on average pay and low pay are going to be considerably worse off next year than they were this year.  That is the simple inescapable fact.  Insofar as the Government responded to that unprecedented cost-of-living and housing crisis, the measures it took &ndash; setting aside the once-off measures &ndash; were more favourable to the better off.  That is the truth about the budget.  Most people will be worse off next year.  They are paying the price and the Government&rsquo;s response was to favour the better off on an ongoing basis.  It is true that some of the once-off measures will blunt, for a few months, the crippling impact of the energy price hikes and the general rise in inflation.  They will blunt it, but overall, they will not compensate for the scale of inflation and the broader rise in the cost of living.<\/p>  <p>  That is happening at the same time when big business is enjoying an absolute bonanza in profits.  I do not know if the Minister can give us an update, for example, on corporate profits, because as we know, we do not get the full details of corporate profits until a couple of years after those profits are recorded, but the trajectory on corporate profits is unmistakable and quite frankly staggering in recent years.  In 2012, corporate profits were &euro;74 billion.  By 2020, corporate profits were &euro;193 billion.  That is a staggering increase.  Corporate profits have almost trebled.  Although we do not have the figures for 2021 and 2022 yet, it would seem clear from the Government&rsquo;s own projections on corporate tax receipts that this year they will be &euro;20 billion.<\/p> <p>In 2020, they were &euro;11 billion.  The corporation tax that is coming in is almost doubling, and that can only happen if there has been a further staggering increase in the profits made by corporations.  As we know, the bulk of those profits is being made by a few hundred incredibly, staggeringly, obscenely profitable corporations.  The 2020 figures show &euro;193 billion in total pre-tax profits and &euro;11 billion paid, which works out at about 6.1% tax paid on their gross, pre-tax trading profits.  If we extrapolate from the &euro;20 billion we are estimated to get in receipts this year, that suggests extraordinary increases in profits.<\/p> <p> Of course, we know all this.  They are the broad, macro figures on dizzying increases in profits but there is a lot of other evidence from particular sectors.  In the energy sector, the large energy producers and companies have witnessed staggering profits over the past two years in particular, at precisely the same time when people are being crushed with energy price hikes on an unprecedented scale and when people are experiencing increases in their bills at an unaffordable level.  There has been nothing yet, although there have been promises, in terms of windfall taxes to be imposed on the profits of these companies.<\/p> <p> I was looking at the figures for Cement Roadstone Holdings.  The Government has this misguided notion of bringing in the concrete levy, which will increase the cost of homes for people, instead of taxing the profits of people who are really profiting in the area of concrete, cement, construction materials and so on.  I was leafing through CRH's accounts for 2021 and, again, they are just staggering.  The earnings per share for 2021 at CRH increased in one year by 130%.  There is no cost-of-living crisis for those who own lots of shares in CRH or for the people who own shares in private energy companies.  There is no cost-of-living crisis for people who own substantial shares in those corporations that are seeing staggering increases in profits.  Other people's misery is generating additional income, profits and dividends for the rich.  That is the reality.<\/p> <p> In property, again, it is self-evident.  I mentioned earlier the Tathony House situation unfolding in Dublin 8.  A landlord who inherited from a family member, as I understand it, a 35-unit apartment complex is now evicting all the people in the complex, who received notices to quit last week.  Imagine the shock and fear that induces in those families.  One person is a nurse in St. James's Hospital, while another happens to be a People Before Profit councillor.  They are ordinary working people, now faced with eviction by a landlord who, they have worked out, based on the average rents in that apartment block, must have a rent roll of about &euro;700,000 a year on that property alone, for which one of the residents went so far as to check with the Companies Registration Office the taxes paid and it is recorded that about &euro;69,000 is paid in tax.  That is &euro;69,000 on a rent roll of about &euro;700,000.  That landlord is doing pretty well but not well enough, it seems, because he now wants to cash in on the increased value of property.  As property prices go through the roof, is there a windfall tax, that is, an increased capital gains tax, for all those who bought property from the National Asset Management Agency, NAMA, at the bottom of the market, the sorts of people who are trying to cash in on the extortionate value of property at the moment?  No, there was no such tax in the budget, although there should have been because these people have made a stunning fortune from the terrible decisions of the Fine Gael-Labour Party Government of 2011-2016 to unload property assets at a nominal value of about &euro;42 billion, which must be worth three or four times that now, as these people cash in - or cash out - on the enormous capital gains they have accrued, where they have paid little or no tax on the rents they have received.  The large, international investors will pay little on their capital gains but they can cash out tax free, with no serious measures to capture some of those incredible windfall gains these people have made.<\/p> <p> That is the reality of the inflation, cost-of-living and housing crises.  A relatively small cohort of supremely wealthy individuals and corporations are making shocking, obscene profits, that is, a bonanza like we have never seen before, while ordinary people are crushed to the point where they do not how they will pay their bills.  They simply cannot sustain the levels of rent being charged, but there are winners in all of this.  They are the broad facts and the Government&rsquo;s budget against that background is, even by the assessment of the ESRI, regressive.<\/p> <p> I might outline some of the specific measures in the Bill.  I do not support the renter&rsquo;s tax credit at all, and while I accept Sinn F&eacute;in believes in a higher renter&rsquo;s tax credit, I am afraid I just do not believe in renters&rsquo; tax credits as a way to address this problem, whether it is &euro;500, &euro;1,000 or whatever it is, because it is chasing rents that are off the Richter scale.  I am sure people will be glad of the &euro;500 or &euro;1,000 but it is a drop in the ocean, it is not dealing with the problem and it is public money ultimately going into the pockets of private landlords.  What we need is not something one could include in a Finance Bill but it would be a better way to deal with the problem.  As the Minister knows, we have advocated that we introduce proper rent controls whereby we actually control rents and ensure they are set at affordable levels.  We believe, and we have put forward a Bill to this effect, that rents should, as a matter of law, amount to no more on average than about 25% of anybody's income.  I was reading an interesting paper, of which the Minister might be aware, relating to the income thresholds and the review he carried out.  It is incredible.  The review he carried out estimates that people in Dublin, for example, are paying about 60% of their income on rent.  It is absolutely shocking stuff.  Many of those people are not even entitled to social housing or housing assistance payment, HAP, support for the extortionate rents they are paying.  Against that background, the &euro;500 renter's tax credit is a joke.  It is not going to make any difference and it will be money into the pockets of landlords who are making an absolute fortune.<\/p> <p> The only response the Government gives when we suggest serious rent controls that would reduce the cost of rent is to say landlords will exit the market.  If that is the case, good.  We should take the properties off them.  The properties do not have to exit.  If landlords want to exit because they want only to follow maximum profit, just buy the properties off them.  We have a lot of money, which the Minister has I think mistakenly put into the rainy day fund, totalling &euro;6 billion.  Why would we not use that money to expand dramatically the State's stock of public and affordable housing?  If we do not do that, we will end up just making cash payments to landlords, whether through the rental accommodation scheme, RAS, HAP, leasing arrangements or renters' credits.  We will end up just subsidising extortionate rents and pouring well in excess of &euro;1 billion a year in current expenditure when this credit is added.<\/p> <p>That is the thing we cannot afford.  When talking about our debt position and our financial position, we cannot afford to allow current expenditure to grow exponentially.  The way to deal with that is for the State to have its own social and affordable housing stock on a much better scale than we have now.  That capital investment is expensive at the outset but it saves billions over the medium to long term. It begins to generate revenue to the State and, of course, not least, ensures that people who are in what is essentially publicly subsidised housing - the HAP, the RAS and all these things are publicly subsidised - will have security and will not be facing the prospect of eviction but will have affordable housing and social housing.  That is the alternative.  We will get there eventually.<\/p> <p> The Minister should have a read about what they do Finland.  In Helsinki, 70% of all the building land is in the hands of the city.  They have their own state construction company and 55% of everything that is built is social and affordable housing.  What is the point in building stuff that nobody can afford?  The State ends up paying for it anyway through RAS, HAP and leasing.  It is absolute insanity but it suits the institutional investors, vulture funds, corporate landlords and so on.<\/p> <p> The vacant property tax is similarly a joke.  It is three times the rate of the LPT.  It is not going to disincentivise these people.  It is just not enough.  The capital gains they are making by sitting on empty property is multiples of that.  It is still profitable for these people to sit on an empty property.  I have been going on about St. Helen's Court in my area for four years.  It is right across the road from me.  It literally stares me in the face every day in my office.  A vulture fund from the North - not even an international fund - bought it and has, essentially, intimidated three quarters of the tenants out.  It has been sitting on 15 empty apartments for three years now and is trying to evict the rest of the tenants.  It is profitable for it to do that.  We allow and facilitate that.  We do not make it absolutely illegal.  We do not take the properties off it and house the people on the housing list.  We let it do this.  It will walk away with massive capital gains when it finally sells that property.  It is quite honestly beyond belief.<\/p> <p> I want to mention the USC and changes around the minimum wage to ensure this tiny pathetic increase in the minimum wage will not accrue an extra USC.  That is fine but the problem is that the level of the minimum wage increase at 80 cent is an absolute joke.  I have raised the plight of a fantastic group of workers, that is, private security workers, a number of times.  Currently, their employment regulation order, ERO, means their minimum pay is &euro;11.65 per hour.  Top Security, which is a company that gets public contracts, is resisting that moving up to &euro;12.50.  This is a company that gets public contracts and is making an absolute fortune.  We do not do anything about that.  The way the Government can cut across that is by increasing the minimum wage to something decent or at least to the level of the minimum wage.  The minimum wage now is under &euro;13.  In our view, it should be as high as &euro;15 per hour.<\/p> <p> I will cover other stuff on Committee Stage but I want to signal to the Minister an issue we have discussed many times, namely, the need to further amend the legislation around section 481 regarding the film tax film tax credit.  The various stakeholders of the film industry appeared before the Committee on Budgetary Oversight, of which I am a member.  Of course, we had the usual chorus of film producers, contractors, guilds, Screen Ireland and so on saying everything is wonderful and rosy in the garden and we should keep it the way it is.  Then, we had representatives from Equity, performers, artists and representatives from the Irish Film Workers Association.  The picture they presented was not so rosy.  To cut a long story short, Equity said that its members' intellectual property rights, and the equitable remuneration they are supposed to get for the ongoing use of their intellectual property on further performances of movies and so on, are essentially being taken off them by the producers.  They are forced into signing contracts where, essentially, they waive the rights to proper remuneration on that.  They are getting contracts that are far inferior to what actors and performers get in the UK.  Similarly, we heard testimonies from crew who said they had been blacklisted.  Dozens of workers were blacklisted out of the industry.  They take cases to the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, about unfair dismissal but the designated activity company, DAC, is the employer, and that DAC no longer exists by the time people get a case to the WRC.  The recipients of section 481 who set up the DAC, where the DAC is a wholly-owned subsidiary of those producer companies, say they have nothing to do with those employees.  It is an absolute scam.  The Minister needs to amend section 481 to make it absolutely clear that the producer company that is the recipient of section 481 is responsible for the employees and is the employer.  He needs to make sure there is not a situation where artists, performers and so on are essentially being forced to sign inferior contracts where their rights to their intellectual property, royalties and residuals are essentially being taken off them by producer companies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102500033#FF00500","speaker":"1478","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1666720800,"counter":333,"content":"<p>I have four minutes; is that correct?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102500035#HH00200","speaker":"1568"},{"type":"speech","time":1666720800,"counter":334,"content":"<p>It is a seven-minute slot and the Deputy is the only person here.

I listened to much of the debate and I think it is important for us to remember what happened on budget day.  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath, and the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, put forward an &euro;11 billion package to try to alleviate what we know to be an incredibly difficult period for people in Ireland.  We had that &euro;11 billion.  That was not borrowed money; that was money that was created by the Irish people.  We have used that to protect people as much as is possible from external forces outside of Ireland in terms of inflation and growing energy costs.  That situation of &euro;11 billion is very different from many other countries.  We should only look across the water where politicians are talking about spending cuts whereas we in this House are talking about an &euro;11 billion package to protect workers and families and their jobs.<\/p><p>We need to draw a line under that because we know populist politics has a cost.  By the way, populist politics is not something only used by those on the left - I am not suggesting that it is.  However, populist politics across the political spectrum has a cost and when the maths are added up at the end, that cost often falls on ordinary people.<\/p><p>We are talking today about the Finance Bill.  We do not talk about much of what was in the Social Welfare Bill.  I want to reflect on what the ESRI, said about the budget, however  It said many things but, of course, I will pick the quote that is of most advantage.  We cannot forget what it said, however.  It stated:<\/p> <blockquote> \tThe government's approach to insulating households from the rise in energy prices has been effective.  Targeted welfare measures combined with universal household energy credits will do more for most households ... than had welfare payments risen in line with inflation this year and next [year]. <\/blockquote>  <p>To me, that says this is a Government that wants to protect people, not a Government that somehow wants to unprogressively punish people.  Yes, there are many measures in here for social welfare recipients but there are also measures for working people.  I have no shame in defending the increase in the standard tax rates.  I would say particularly to employers who are struggling to recruit people that there are measures in this Bill, including one-off special payments that avoid tax, which employers should be applying to workers.  There is the increase in bonus payments from one to two and from &euro;500 to &euro;1,000.

I would like to echo what Deputy McAuliffe said.  This budget is putting money back into people's pockets through decreases in taxation, the one-off measures and the substantial social welfare increases across the board.  It is only possible because of prudent financial management over the last decade and of course, the extraordinary response of the Irish people in jobs and companies up and down the country during the course of the pandemic.  That only happened because of the level of support that was provided by the Government over the past three years.<\/p>  <p>  One of the most important aspects of the budget is the elements that have been put in place for one-off supports because of the cost-of-living crisis, such as the &euro;600 being provided over three payments to households for the purposes of supporting them because of rising inflationary elements in energy costs.  There is also recognition that those payments will not cover all of the energy increases and that is why the social welfare budget has been increased to include one-off payments, double payments and additional supports.  In January of next year, we will see the ninth increase in the minimum wage take effect.  That is the ninth increase since my party entered government in March 2011.<\/p>  <p>  We will further invest in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, keeping our streets safe and following up on commitments we gave to adequately resource our Defence Forces in line with the Commission on the Defence Forces.  This is extremely important not just because of the current global environment but also because we want to honour the men and women in uniform and ensure they have the appropriate equipment to deal with the task we set out before them.<\/p>  <p>  In just three minutes it is hard to cover all of the territory but I will focus on three important areas.  First is the investment in housing that Deputy McAuliffe closed his contribution on.  I echo his remarks about those making comments on housing while ignoring the work that is going on in the background and the increased budget that Department has been given.  I note both education Departments and the likes of free school books at primary level, the reduction in and rebate on third level fees, and the increase in the numbers of those who will eligible for the Student Universal Support Ireland, SUSI, grant.  Lowering income tax for middle-income workers is a very important aspect of this budget.  Whether it is the average, mean or median wage level in the State, the taxation measures will actually support them.  Finally, I refer to the importance of the State running a budget surplus when so many around us are not.  Investing for the future and ensuring that if there is another hiccup along the road, we are adequately resourced to respond to it is almost as important as the &euro;11 billion in this budget.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102500036#JJ00200","speaker":"1562"},{"type":"speech","time":1666721400,"counter":340,"content":"<p>The number of vacant homes in this city is really depressing.  According to new data from the Central Statistics Office there are 37,000 vacant homes in Dublin alone.  That does not count Dublin City Council vacant homes.  Within a short distance from here, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, I could bring you to 50 empty flats that could be used if they were brought back to life.  It is painfully clear to all who live in the city and those commuting in and out that many of these homes have been left empty for years.  Those years of neglect are dragging back the city and communities they are built in.  These vacant and neglected homes are being left empty amid the worst housing crisis the State has ever faced.  There are thousands upon thousands of people crying out for the chance to have a home in their community, where they grew up and among their family and friends.  Sinn F&eacute;in has long called for a vacant homes tax in the face of Government opposition.  A vacant homes tax must not exclude derelict property and must apply a rate for long-term vacancy.  We need an effective vacant homes tax that will push vacant homes back onto the market.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister with responsibility for sports also announced a &euro;35 million package to help sports clubs over this winter.  That is absolutely welcome.  It is really important that clubs are supported through this crisis.  However, over a month has passed.  Clubs are really struggling and waiting for clarity and communication about how this payment will be distributed.  One issue that many small local sports clubs, which we all know about, have raised with me is concern around how the scheme will be rolled out.  They are concerned that many of the bigger clubs, which are well resourced in terms of professional supports and professional members, will get the bulk of the funds and the smaller, less well resourced clubs will get the crumbs.  That is a real worry for a lot of small clubs.  Bill are mounting fast for clubs.  I understand many clubs are reducing the number of nights they train in order to cut the cost of floodlighting and to reduce their energy bills.  I seek clarification on how long it will be before there is communication with the clubs on this fund.<\/p>  <p>  Also connected, last week the heavy rainfall affected many of the grass pitches across the country.  Particularly in Dublin, the parks authorities called off a lot of pitches, which means they cannot be played on.  That really highlights the under-investment in all-weather sports facilities.  We need to ensure investment in them.  We need all-weather sports facilities and they are not there.  We have grass pitches and all they do is cut the grass on them.  They do not manage those pitches.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102500036#JJ00300","speaker":"1555"},{"type":"speech","time":1666721400,"counter":341,"content":"<p>The Finance Bill, which gives effect to some of the measures arising from the recent budget, is being considered in a number of particular contexts, including the cost-of-living crisis and electricity supply crisis.  This year, a huge increase in the cost of energy is an additional cost for those who are already struggling to get by.  Even before the recent spike in inflation, Ireland was the one of the most expensive countries in the EU in which to live.  Our housing costs are the highest in the EU while the price of goods and services is 40% higher than the average across the EU.  Generally speaking, the budget was welcomed by most people and businesses.  In my speech on budget day, I acknowledged the Government's efforts to improve the circumstances of the public and the business community.<\/p>  <p>  I wish to raise a number of items specifically relating to sections 84, 86 and 88 of the Bill.  First and foremost, section 88 makes provision for the &euro;1.25 billion temporary business energy support scheme, which was originally planned to cover just case I businesses, such as those involved in trade such as shops, hotels and restaurants.  I welcome the announcement that the Finance Bill will extend this scope to cover case II businesses also.  The fund aims to help mainly small businesses, covering up to 40% of the increase in energy bills, up to &euro;10,000 per month until February.  However, the Government has also decided that where a business operates from more than one location, the cap will be increased to a maximum of &euro;30,000 per month.  This is good news for some, but not for all.  Although these measures are welcome, there are serious concerns being brought to me by businesses in Dundalk that are experiencing sky-rocketing electricity bills.  The issue with the new energy support is that it only runs until February, and that date is even subject to EU approval.  We are ending our energy support in February and then increasing VAT to 13.5% on the hospitality sector on 1 March.  Are we trying to close businesses?  This is disappointing and does not give certainty to business owners, especially if they have a hard winter.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland Active; the representative body for leisure centres, gyms, swimming pools and commercial sports facilities in Ireland has stated that the cost of heating pools is resulting in very high bills.  In Dundalk alone there are three leisure centres.  On top of this, we have some of the biggest call centres that, during Covid, complied with the remote working model.  Now, many employees who have been working from home since the pandemic are weighing up their options coming into winter.  Many consider it more costly to work from home with the price of oil and gas on the rise, and are considering returning to the office.  This is going to cause a lot of problems for the businesses.  Some are experiencing a 300% to 400% increase in utility costs.  This is going to cause lay-offs in businesses.<\/p> <p>When the temporary business energy support scheme is found not to help that much, there will be serious problems.  I agree that the electricity measures have provided relief for many households but the hospitality sector is again suffering.  This shows the Government is out of touch with hardworking business owners who, after surviving the Covid crisis, are now being crippled by the cost of living.  This is the main message I am getting from people in my constituency.<\/p> <p> Homelessness is at record levels.  People are queuing on the streets for a room.  They are being priced out of buying a home and they are paying nearly half their wages in rent.  The housing crisis is felt in every part of the country.  In my constituency of Louth and in east Meath, there is a severe housing shortage and spiralling rental costs.  The latest figures from Daft.ie show the cost of renting in Louth has risen by more than 8% in the past year, with the average rent now at &euro;1,420.  Letting agencies have painted a devastating picture of the current rental market, with the shortage of supply hitting people of all ages and walks of life.  In Louth and east Meath, the rental crisis is catastrophic, with thousands of people viewing a handful of homes.<\/p> <p> I have raised the issue of vacant homes numerous times in the House.  I welcome section 84 of the Bill, which introduces a vacant homes tax in order to increase the supply of homes for rent or purchase.  The provision will, I hope, encourage the owners of long-term vacant properties that are habitable and are subject to local property tax to bring them back into use.  However, it will not apply to derelict or uninhabitable properties.  In this time of crisis, we must ensure all houses are fully utilised.<\/p> <p> Section 86 introduces provision for a defective concrete product levy, with the intention of raising revenue to contribute towards mica reliefs.  Although section 5 extends and enhances the help-to-buy relief for a further two years, this levy will penalise young people trying to build or buy their first home, as well as local authorities trying to build social housing.  The burden of the new levy is likely to fall on the residents of new-build homes rather than on the building industry.  The Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland calculates it will add approximately &euro;4,000 to the cost of an average three-bedroom semi-detached house.  We need to assess fully the cost implications of this new levy and how it will affect the most vulnerable in our society.  As I have mentioned previously, it will have an all-encompassing effect on our economy, including on construction and housing, infrastructure and right across the board to our farming industry.<\/p> <p> The Finance Bill and budget are two sides of the same coin.  The real test will be their ability to have an impact on people's lives.  There are many aspects of the Bill that we must praise.  The increase in tax credits, the increase in inclusivity and other aspects need to be acknowledged.  However, we are entering into a very volatile period in respect of living costs.  The Bill has been neither future-proofed nor rural-proofed.  The cost of most items is rising far too quickly.  The cost of building homes is increasing swiftly.  The cost of lighting and heating homes is rising rapidly.  Any benefits people will get from this Bill and the budget will quickly be absorbed by those rising costs.  I fear the real danger will be inflation.  It is important that the Government recognises this and takes whatever action needs to be taken.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102500036#JJ00400","speaker":"1600","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1666722000,"counter":343,"content":"<p>I have several points to make.  First, a number of constituents have raised with me the issue of benefit-in-kind adjustments.  The writer of one email on the subject said:<\/p> <blockquote> \tDear Verona, I am writing to you about an issue which is going to affect my ability to feasibly do my job and whether or not I can continue in it.  I am a sales rep.  In the recent budget, the Government has proposed changes to be made on benefit-in-kind for those with a car provided by their employer.  I cannot use a commercial van, so I am going to see a rise of nearly 50% in benefit-in-kind payments annually.<br \/><br \/>This measure is to incentivise people to use electric cars.  I understand that.  However, this is currently not practical for a sales rep as I cover a large geographical area and I travel into rural areas where electric vehicle charging points are not available.  Additionally, I am under time pressure and do not have the luxury of waiting an hour to charge a vehicle.  My car is my office and it is as important and crucial to me as your phone and laptop are to you.  It is not a luxury that the company give me and for that reason I strongly urge that you ask the Government to offer a tiered system for those people who use the car in this way, or I will most likely be joining the social welfare system. <\/blockquote>  <p>My constituents raise some very valid concerns and I urge the Minister to make allowances for them in the implementation of the new policy.  I ask that the proposed timelines be delayed or scrapped now that he is aware of the unintended consequences and difficulties they present.  Thousands of workers will be hit by a massively increased tax bill as a result of the measure.  It does not seem at all fair or equitable.  Again, it is the squeezed middle being squeezed to death.  Constituents frequently say there seems to be no area of society where the Government is not trying to make life worse for the ordinary working people who are just trying to make ends meet.  How can there be such a disconnect?<\/p><p>After a few weeks of a drop, we see fuel prices creeping up again, with diesel currently costing well over &euro;2 per litre at the pumps.  Fuel is the common denominator in this crisis.  It is responsible for the biggest increase in the cost of living and is, in turn, driving up inflation.  Yet, the Government has decided only public service workers will be recognised as incurring cost rises.  They are being given a 6.5% pay increase, leaving low- and middle-income earners to suffer on.  The Government must remove excise duties on fuel, as I proposed almost a year ago, and it needs to do so now.  The Exchequer can afford, on a trial basis, to remove all excise on fuels.  It will enable people to afford to do their jobs, particularly in rural Ireland, where there is no meaningful public transport and people have to use their cars.  The question for most of those people is not how they will get to work but whether they will go to work.  For them, work does not pay and that has to change.<\/p><p>Carers, to give just one example, are leaving their jobs.  They get a measly 15 cent per kilometre.  It does not pay them to use their car and nor do they receive a stamp towards a pension entitlement.  Family carers continue to be means tested for the fuel allowance, which is just cruel.  Those in charge and earning a much greater salary failed to comprehend the recruitment and retention crisis in the sector.  Being unable to recruit and retain carers means the budget announcement of &euro;11 billion in spending, which Deputy McAuliffe tried to impress upon us, will not be used.  There are announcements about increased funding for home care support schemes but that money just does not get spent.  Those announcements, like so many others, are just spin announcements.<\/p><p>I asked during my budget speech on housing earlier in the month whether the concrete levy will be applied to the price of concrete inclusive of VAT.  That question went unanswered and is still unanswered even though the levy has been halved.  The levy should be abandoned, not diminished.  It is a sticking plaster being applied to a massive wound.  The truth about mica is that those culpable went unregulated.  The innocent paid and the Government continues to make them pay with a lifelong levy, just like the one introduced in response to the PMPA insurance crisis more than 40 years ago.  It did nothing for insurance only make it more expensive.  The competition regulator failed to investigate the insurance market's gouging of customers for years.  That gouging continues and, 40 years later, so does the levy.<\/p><p>It is unbelievable that in the middle of possibly the worst housing crisis in the history of the State, the Government decided to increase taxes on house-building.  The world looks on in disbelief not because we cannot house our homeless but because this is being done at a time when we are exclaiming to the world that we can take in and house more than 200,000 unfortunate Ukrainian refugees, not having even considered the 10,000 homeless people we had before the war broke out.  It would be funny if it were not so tragic.  For the sake of our people who are in need of housing supply, will the Minister please rethink raising the money on the mica scheme?  Will he try cutting wasteful expenditure on lawsuits arising from incompetent semi-State bodies?  An Bord Plean&aacute;la would be a good place to start.<\/p><p>There must be further discussion as to the behaviour of the Central Bank in relaxing lending rules by increasing the multiple that may be borrowed to four times applicant's earnings.  It is very strange to see lending rules relaxed at a time when the cost of borrowing has increased and people's ability to pay has reduced due to increased costs in so many other areas.  It raises the question as to why on earth this move was not made three years ago when houses were more affordable and the ability to make repayments was greater.  Relaxing the rules at that time would have helped a lot of people to get on the housing ladder.<\/p> <p>Remaining prudent was the excuse used back then, when housing was available at a more affordable price.  These policies must have potential first-time buyers tearing their hair out.  Everywhere they turn, the arms of the State have conspired to put barriers in their way.  Now, when the cost of living is a crisis point, their spending is reduced, and as interest rates rise at a rocketing pace, the regulator sees fit to say \"Tally-ho\" to prudence, but \"buyer beware\".  I am afraid that that is just another regulator that is about as useful as an ashtray on a motorbike.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102500037#KK00200","speaker":"1622","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1666722600,"counter":345,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Finance Bill 2022 and to address some of the queries that have been raised since the budget was announced.  The energy supports for households are to be welcomed, but the problem is that there are anomalies in the whole process, and pay-as-you-go customers are not sure how they are going to get the credits or how it is going to work.  That must be clarified, as a matter of urgency, in order to ensure that it is clear how people who need the support most can get it.  I understand that the changes to the fuel allowance are going to come into effect on 1 January.  The problem is that the application process will not begin until after that.  There will be people in February, March and April completing their applications for the fuel allowance, and payments will be backdated to January.  People are under financial strain and do not need to be waiting for backdated payments.<\/p>  <p>  Another issue that I want to raise concerns students and part-time students who do not qualify for the &euro;1,000 reduction in their fees.  It is a mistake to do that.  These are young people who have been working or continue to work, are trying to improve their lives, and are paying a lot of money to be educated.  We should recognise that they are doing something that is right and correct, and we should encourage them by including them in the scheme for the rebate for students.<\/p>  <p>  On benefit-in-kind, there is a false impression that when a person has a company car or vehicle, he or she is on the gravy train.  When I worked in private industry and had a company car, it was a necessity.  It was my office.  I had my files and everything else in it to allow me to deal with my day-to-day work.  I was in different parts of the country, whether Dublin, Galway or wherever, and I needed the car.  The problem now is that the Government is trying to differentiate between those with electric cars and those with fossil fuel cars.  The Minister of State knows, as he heard last Saturday, that we do not have the infrastructure in this country to support electric cars, particularly in the regions and the west of Ireland.  Why are we trying to penalise people who have petrol or diesel cars when they cannot viably operate electric cars because they cannot be confident that they will get them charged when they need to?  These are people who are tied to timeframes.  It is important that we look at this matter.<\/p>  <p>  Another issue that arises concerns once-off payments.  I feel very strongly about the &euro;500 payment that is being made to people with disabilities.  Not everybody who has a disability will get the payment.  People who were on disability payments and moved over to the old-age pension when they reached the age of 66 will not get this &euro;500.  They still have the disability, but because they changed from one category of payment to another because of their age and entitlement to old-age pension, they are going to be excluded from this particular payment.  That is wrong.  More importantly, the &euro;500 should not be a once-off payment to people with disabilities; it should be the start of a process by which people with disabilities are given enough money to be able to live.  Back in 2019, the Government commissioned a report from Indecon.  That report pointed out that it cost between &euro;7,800 and &euro;12,000 for people to live with disabilities at that time.  The cost of disability was that much.  The &euro;500 payment is welcome, but it should be made an annual payment that is increased year on year over the next five to six years in recognition of the fact that people with disabilities have additional costs.  It is very important that we look at that.  It would make a difference.<\/p>  <p>  There is a lot of talk about housing.  I have mentioned the issue previously.  The day after the budget, I questioned the concrete block levy.  Changes have been made in the sense that the levy has been reduced and the introduction of the levy will be deferred until September.  The timing is wrong.  It is ill-judged to be even talking about adding more to the cost of construction at this stage.  What we should be doing is concentrating on schemes that we have announced that have not actually come into effect.  The Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe fund scheme for rural houses was announced at the ploughing championships, but no local authority can deal with it yet because they do not have the paperwork or a directive from a Minister to do so.  Let us get real.  If we are saying that schemes are in place, let us make sure they are operating from the date on which they are announced, and that the spade work is done on them so we can actually put them into place.<\/p>  <p>  In the north and western region areas there are thousands of houses that are vacant.  People are coming to me who want to apply for funding to bring them back into use.  All I can tell them is that they will have to wait until the ministerial direction is issued to the local authorities.  I also wish to point out that the local authorities may not have the necessary resources and staff to deal with all this additional stuff that is coming into play for them.  They need to be supported with additional resources to make sure that these schemes can work.  It cannot be like the retrofitting scheme, which was introduced and announced with a fanfare a number of months ago.   To date, 69 houses have been retrofitted out of a target of thousands.  There is something fundamentally wrong when we have schemes like that.  We are not going through the process of thinking these schemes out, putting a plan in place for their implementation and actually testing them to make sure that they will work.  There is something amiss.  Sometimes what happens is that people have a good idea and it is just put out there.  The school transport programme is one such example.  We must ensure that whatever we are doing is tried and tested before it is introduced.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102500038#LL00200","speaker":"1482"},{"type":"speech","time":1666722600,"counter":346,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Finance Bill 2022.

Given the difficult winter that is facing us all, I welcome the progressive measures contained within this Bill, which are designed to ensure that those in society who are most impacted by rising bills and inflationary pressures, along with the squeezed middle, are supported in what is an enormous cost-of-living budget.  This Bill has Fine Gael's fingerprints all over it.  I also welcome the contributions of the coalition Government partners.<\/p>  <p>  No one across our society has avoided the difficulties posed by rising costs.  The Government cannot insulate everyone fully from them.  Those difficulties are set to get more acute as we approach the end of the year and the start of the new one.  However, &euro;1.2 billion has been allocated for supports to help consumers over this year and next year, which is a hugely important step.  Chapter 3 will give rise to a reduction in the amount of tax that workers pay, putting more hard-earned money back into people's pockets, with a fairer income tax package for all.   The increase in the standard rate of cut-off for a single person, from &euro;36,800 to &euro;40,000, will certainly assist middle-income workers across the board.<\/p>  <p>  Section 12 sets out a really positive measure that introduces a new tax credit for renters that is worth &euro;500 per renter, and &euro;1,000 for couples.  Thankfully, the &euro;500 tax credit will also be extended to parents who pay rent on behalf of their sons and daughters attending third level education, which will also ease their burden.<\/p>  <p>  Section 5 supports our housing policy to extend the help-to-buy scheme for a further two years.<\/p> <p>It is an essential step that has already helped over 36,000 householders to date.

People in other countries to whom I have spoken are amazed that we come into the highest tax rate at such an early stage.  The Irish income tax system has rightly been described as the most progressive in the world.  However, I wonder whether, wittingly or unwittingly, we make it a little less progressive through this decision.  The difficulty if the threshold is raised from &euro;36,800 to &euro;40,000 is that working people who earn up to &euro;36,800 do not get that particular benefit.  I know that some misleading figures have been put around here because many of those people qualify for the working family payment, if they meet the various criteria.  Some qualify for more than others.  Nevertheless, I am a bit mystified as to why something could not have been done, for example, with USC, to at least narrow the advantage it has given to people who earn a multiple of others who earn less than &euro;36,800 per annum.  That should have been done.<\/p>  <p>  I also welcome the extension of the TBESS to professionals.  That was a good move.  However, I am somewhat amazed it has not been extended to charities.  Charities are facing increasing demand, decreasing contributions and increasing costs.  Their reserves are depleted after the pandemic.  The charity sector is very important.  It does an enormous amount of work, particularly in the areas of mental health and disabilities.  They assist people with housing, etc.  They are also businesses, albeit not for profit.  They are facing a perfect storm.  Even at this late stage, the Government should look at the notion of extending this particular concession to charities.  I do not know how much it would cost.  Perhaps the Minister could examine that.  I would appreciate it if he would respond specifically to that point when he is replying to this debate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102500039#MM00200","speaker":"1492"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1666723200,"counter":349,"content":"<p>Debate adjourned.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"\u00c1bhair Shaincheisteanna Tr\u00e1th\u00fala - Topical Issue Matters","time":1666723200,"counter":350,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102500039#MM00400"},{"type":"speech","time":1666723200,"counter":351,"content":"<p>I wish to advise the House of the following matters in respect of which notice has been given under Standing Order 37 and the name of the Member in each case:<\/p><p>  Deputy Jennifer Murnane O'Connor - to discuss plans to change the model of contracts between the Departments of Social Protection and Health and dentists in Ireland.<\/p><p>  Deputy Bernard J.

When one strips back the temporary but absolutely necessary interventions in this Finance Bill, the stark reality is laid bare.  It abysmally fails to address the growing inequality that is crippling our society.  It is not only me and Sinn F&eacute;in saying that.  Social Justice Ireland estimates that this Finance Bill will widen the gap between rich and poor by &euro;199 next year.  It has stated that Ireland's poorest will be worse off when the one-off measures in budget 2023 are discontinued.  The change to the highest income tax rate is the most expensive measure in the Bill but despite the cost to the public finances, 2.2 million workers will not benefit at all.  This is unfair and economically reckless.<\/p>  <p>  Low-income families spend heavily within the local economy, thereby supporting indigenous business and jobs.  Businesses in small towns are now hibernating or getting ready to hibernate for the winter months because that is the only way that many of them will be able to survive.  The reduced footfall and escalating costs combine to a reality where debts accumulate.  Every choice made by the Government in this Finance Bill will have a knock-on effect on local economies.  When we tally all the tax measures, people earning &euro;100,000 will benefit four times as much as those earning &euro;35,000.  It is a measure designed to benefit high earners and leave low- and middle-income earners to face into the winter and a cost-of-living crisis.<\/p>  <p>  The Government plans to push house prices up through the badly designed defective blocks levy.  There are elements of the Government housing policy that can be tracked back to Sinn F&eacute;in, for instance, the tax back for renters and the ban on evictions.  I welcome those measures.  They are watered-down versions of our policies but at least they are a step in the right direction.  The tax rebate will only work if there is ban on increases and we need to end the rip-off rents.<\/p>  <p>  We need to delay the introduction of the new benefit-in-kind regime until some form of distinction can be made between a company car as a perk and company vehicles that are essential for work-related activity.  That is important.  I ask the Minister to look again at that measure to see how we can introduce some fairness.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the fact that student accommodation is now included in the tax rebate but there are still too many people paying rent who are excluded.  I am concerned because the tax rebate will only extend to renters in accommodation registered with the Residential Tenancies Board, RTB.  We know that many students will not meet that criterion.  I ask the Minister to consider that matter and see how all people who are paying rent can be accommodated.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102500039#MM00800","speaker":"1501"},{"type":"speech","time":1666723200,"counter":355,"content":"<p>I am pleased to speak.  In the short time available for me to speak on the Finance Bill, I am only going to be able to cover a fraction of the issues.  I will certainly address the concrete levy because this is a farce.  It is showing the white flag to the real perpetrators of that awful mica and pyrite crisis.  Those perpetrators were the quarries.  The Minister obviously has no appetite to touch big business.  We see that across the country.  He has decided to put the problem onto the building of every house.  The levy will add at least &euro;4,000 to the cost of building even a modest 2,000 sq. ft house.  Under pressure, the Minister has backtracked and halved the levy.  It is still the wrong way to go, however.<\/p>  <p>The sacred cows and the windfall profits of Cement Roadstone plc, which owns 99.9% of the quarries - if not in name it owns them indirectly - should be tackled.<\/p> <p> The same applies to carers.  While there are welcome increases in the threshold, there was nothing meaningful done for the carers, such as having their pay linked to issues like the fuel allowance or the plethora of other payments there are.  They do an enormous amount of work and keep people out of hospital.  Now we have the problem where we cannot get home helps.  The Government certainly had an opportunity to do something here.<\/p> <p> The announcement in respect of the Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe scheme was made at the ploughing championships.  The Government is wonderful with announcements but it does not even consult any of the agencies which deliver this.  That is why we have blunder and bluff.<\/p> <p> The Government also announced funding for the temporary business energy support scheme, TBESS, which I welcome for businesses but in the Finance Bill we now see that the number of businesses which this scheme is covering has multiplied.  The amount of money for the scheme was inadequate in the first place because shops and businesses I have quoted here have contacted me and they are still going to be paying &euro;7,000 a month extra for their ESB bills compared with last year, and that is after having received the support from that scheme of up to 40%.  Now if the number of people getting a slice of the cake grows in number, this sum will be totally inadequate.  The Government is playing with people with these figures and giving them out in a spin.<\/p> <p> This Finance Bill lacks any vision or any kind of imagination or understanding of why the people are hurting so much.  This budget and this Finance Bill is the biggest con job that has ever been perpetrated on the people because the Government is taking the money.  The price of diesel now at the pumps has gone up to &euro;2.02, and I saw &euro;2.079 yesterday in Mullingar, or somewhere in the midlands, on Sunday.  Half of that is tax.  The more the price goes up, the more the Government is reaping in.  The price of fuel or oil is the common denominator whether it is social activity, at work, agriculture or industry.<\/p> <p> Also, agus is m&oacute;r an trua &eacute; an rud sin, benefit-in-kind was a good scheme which got people up early in the morning, out to work to travel the roads, and I had many such people on to me.  These are excellent people who worked so hard and who want to work and pay their way.  They were turning over, getting business and generating money for their companies and this was a savage attack.<\/p> <p> Every aspect of this budget has the Minister, Deputy Ryan's fingerprints all over it, even on the bikes scheme.  There is extra relief to get some kind of a cargo bike.  Everywhere you go, you see footpaths and roads being dug up and being narrowed to crucify the motorists and to make lanes for bicycles and so forth.  I am not anti such developments but common sense must prevail.  Every aspect of this budget has been drawn in green ink and I was going to say red ink.  It is a green document.  It is not looking after the business people, the people on the housing list or anyone in that category.  It is just looking after itself, to keep Government bums on those seats there and to ensure the Minister, Deputy Ryan, and his party will not pull out of Government.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102500039#MM00900","speaker":"1612","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1666723800,"counter":357,"content":"<p>The budget was a missed opportunity for many young people who are in a middle road-type situation.  Fuel is hitting them very hard.  They will see very little increases after the budget, only certain pain.  When the Minister was announcing the budget here in the House and when I first looked at the document, to the naked eye the Minister was going to give a decrease in the cost of fuel, but all he did was to continue something he had done earlier.  The pain has grown and grown and, like previous speakers have said, the cost of fuel has gone crazy, at more than &euro;2 a litre for a litre of diesel.  It is an insane situation and people are feeling that very hard.<\/p>  <p>  Agriculture is facing a crisis.  I was speaking to some of the organisations during the week with the fall in the price of cattle and there is a serious worry out there.  Bills are rising, as are fertiliser bills and costs.  These are out of control, especially for agri-fuel.  It would have been especially welcomed if the Minister had lowered the tax take.  It was a greedy tax take by this Government but, of course, it is the only way it can get its hands on as much money as possible so that it can cycle out great amount of grants for this, that and the other thing to see if it can get its senior politicians elected again.<\/p>  <p>  Moving to the fishing situation in this country, I would love to ask the Minister what fishermen ever did to him in school.  I suppose he never saw a fisherman in his life in school because he certainly has something terrible against them.  The Minister gave them nothing, absolute zilch, in this budget.  They exist and are a great part of this country.  They look at being completely whacked left, right and centre.  The best the Government can come up with for them is decommissioning and tying up boats with money from Europe.  Looking at them there, the French and Spanish Governments have given their fishermen fuel subsidies.  What have our fishermen been given?  Zero.  The Government has announced an energy rebate which businesses get, which is fair enough, but the fishermen ask me if they are going to get an energy rebate because they are using very significant amounts of energy.  Where are they going to get a rebate in this?  I hope the Minister will address that when he speaks in a minute because they certainly deserve to survive, the same as anybody else.  I know the Government has almost wiped them out but they certainly deserve to live as well.<\/p>  <p>  People talk to me about the carer&rsquo;s allowance and I ask that perhaps, in time, the Minister might look at the situation where people who genuinely care for their loved ones are being means-tested.  It should not matter a damn if someone spends so many hours every day caring for either a neighbour or a loved one, but they cannot get that money if their husband or wife or whichever way it is is earning a little bit more than they should.  Here is a person who is basically caring for someone and paying for it out of their own pocket.<\/p>  <p>  I have serious worries about the tourism industry VAT going, perhaps, from 9% upwards.  We cannot accept that could happen and I believe the Minister will need to clarify that.  We certainly know the hotel industry, and have met quite a number of its representatives, has not been fleecing the people in west Cork.  I accept some hotels have been.  Those in west Cork have been very fair to the people.  The one thing they told me is that some family members of these family-run hotels will be working for nothing if these hotels are to keep their doors open.  This is a very serious issue and is one area where, if the VAT rises, it will have serious consequences.  I have very little time left but I need to know about the VAT.<\/p>  <p>  I know money was given for school transport but the school bus tickets issue is still a fiasco.  The Government made a complete mess of it.<\/p>  <p>  There is also the blocks issue, and while I am aware the percentage of the levy has been dropped and the Government has accepted it is to go from 10% to 5%, it was not good enough in the first place.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102500040#NN00200","speaker":"1461"},{"type":"speech","time":1666723800,"counter":358,"content":"<p>I am glad to get the opportunity to raise issues about this budget.  All we ever ask in a budget is that the Minister and the Government be fair with all sectors of the people.  That has not happened in this budget.  Sadly, people depending on diesel and petrol-fuelled cars, where they have no other option, together with lorry men who are on the road day after day, were promised throughout the summer that the Government would help them in the budget and it did nothing at all for them.  The Government is saying that whatever few pence it did give them off the cost of fuel last May or June will end at the end of February and the first day of March next year.  The Minister is saying he is managing the finances well and that is how he has the &euro;11 billion, but I say to him that most of that &euro;11 billion is money he collected off people on the road.  Four years ago the barrel of oil was cheaper then than it is now.  At the same time, everyone is paying double except the farmers who are paying a great deal more.  The Minister gave them two cents off.  They are paying &euro;1.50 a litre now, which is almost three quarters the cost of white diesel.  Heretofore, they were only paying a third of the cost.<\/p>  <p>  I told the Minister to reconsider the concrete levy.  He considered it a bit all right but he is still leaving it at 5% and that is too much because, like I said, people who are buying materials to buy house are paying extra VAT and tax on these materials already.  They are paying extra for concrete already, which has gone up from &euro;80 to &euro;115 a cubic metre.  These people are paying extra VAT and tax to the Government already.<\/p>  <p>  On housing, the Government makes such a hullabaloo and acclaim about the housing policy it has.  We see, however, where in Kerry there are 171 vacant houses and the Government will not provide the funding to put both houses or voids back into production.  What is wrong with the Minister?<\/p> <p>Would it not be very easy to do that?  These 171 houses have been vacant for three or four years.  What is wrong with the Government that it will not deal with that?<\/p> <p> On the cost of electricity, there is no account of the regulator at all.  The electricity companies are allowed to double and triple their profits.  We would not mind paying more for electricity if it cost them more to generate it.  We see how hard it is for some people to get social welfare payments.  Many pensioners will not receive the &euro;500 bonus because they do not get fuel allowance or the living alone allowance.  Despite this, there are Ukrainian men of fighting age here getting the same dole and supports as others even though they are being housed, fed and every other thing.  All I am asking for is fair play across the board.  Irish people who have been here all of their lives are not getting that fair play.  I ask the Minister to look at those things and to review some of the decisions the Government has made because they are very unfair.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102500040#NN00300","speaker":"1580","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1666724400,"counter":360,"content":"<p>I am glad to speak on the Finance Bill and on the budget the Minister introduced on behalf of the Minister, Deputy Ryan.  I will first talk about the 9% rate of VAT.  As a representative of the tourism capital of the western world, Killarney in County Kerry, I believe it is wrong for the Minister to allow uncertainty on this matter until February of next year.  Having met with hoteliers last weekend, I know they are certainly not happy with what the Minister is doing or, as should I say, what he is not doing. With regard to the benefit-in-kind scheme, I also met with representatives of a number of businesses last weekend and they are extremely upset at what the Minister has done to that scheme.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to the temporary business energy support scheme, which is very important, I welcome the extra relief to be given to dentists, doctors, solicitors, accountants and others in non-incorporated enterprises.  That is very important because they were being left out.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to the concrete levy, I was the first person to stand up in this House on behalf of the concrete providers in Kerry and those who export concrete products into the North and abroad who were extremely upset at what the Minister was doing.  The Minister has created uncertainty and upset the system.  He has upset the tendering process and shot our local authorities in his own foot in doing what he did.  The half of a U-turn he has done shows he made a mistake.  If he had not made a mistake, he would not have done what he has now done.  All he has proved is that we were right to say he was wrong in the first instance.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to the retrofitting scheme, of the 65,000 houses the Minister, Deputy Ryan, was blowing about being retrofitted, 80 have been completed, including fewer than eight in County Kerry.  I do not know whether Deputy Ryan or the Minister for Finance are proud of that fact.  They can blow all they like about retrofitting but the proof of the pudding is in the eating and only 80 of 65,000 have been completed.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to solar panels, what did the Minister do in the budget to encourage people to install them?  Nothing.  The mantra among businesses that want to install solar panels is not to apply for the grant because the assistance available is difficult to apply for and will amount to nothing at the end of the day.  Anybody in business who is going ahead with solar panels is doing so without the grant.  So much for what the Government is doing for those people.<\/p>  <p>  The small businesses that are being affected by the massive increase in costs, the microenterprises that employ up to nine people, employ more than 400,000 people, nearly half a million.  The people running such businesses in County Kerry and who are really struggling with the increased cost of electricity, diesel, fuel and everything else are saying the budget did nothing for them.<\/p>  <p>  This budget failed to give our farmers a break from the crippling cost of inputs.  For example, the hiking of the carbon tax represents a major blow to hard-pressed farm families.  To take the people now putting cattle in for the winter, for example, they endured the cost of feed and the costs accrued during the year to grow the grass to make silage for the winter, including fertiliser costs.  These people are really worried.  This is going to affect the beef sector after Christmas because there will be no profit to be made because of the high input costs that are putting people under tremendous pressure.

My God, were they surprised.  A great many of them will not qualify for the temporary business energy support scheme, TBESS, as Revenue will need to see an increase of 40% or more in electricity or gas bills compared with bills for this time last year.  Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin has, in the past, accused us of not understanding the consequences of the war between Russia and Ukraine but we seem to understand a lot more than the Government.  The Finance Bill is of the Government's own making and, through the restrictions it has placed on this scheme it introduced in the budget, it has missed an opportunity to help businesses around the country.  These restrictions will prevent many businesses from availing of the TBESS.  Does the Minister know why?  It is because, six or seven months ago, many businesses decided to take the Government's advice and try to save on energy.  What did they do?  They borrowed money to put in solar panels to reduce their energy costs.  They bought generators to reduce their energy costs and now find out that, after making all of these investments, they do not qualify for this scheme.  Many of these businesses have seen increases in energy costs of 25% and 35% but will not get any financial reward from the scheme.<\/p>  <p>  I spoke to a quarry owner today.  The U-turn the Government has done on the block levy is amazing.  I myself highlighted to Government the lunacy of bringing in a concrete levy in the first place because it was targeting every person in the country building a house, renovating one, doing up a garden or replacing a driveway.  The Government did not think it through and has now had to do a U-turn.  Its backbenchers finally found a small bit of backbone and threatened it so it did a U-turn, although it only reduced the levy to 5% and delayed it until September of next year.  If that goes ahead, Government backbenchers will come under far more pressure than they did this year.<\/p>  <p>  What is the crux of this?  How does the Government help people in an energy crisis?  The price of fuel goes up and this Government's taxation system takes 50% on diesel and almost the same percentage on petrol.  For every euro spent at the fuel pump, the Government takes 50%.  What is used to manufacture food in this country?  Fossil fuel-powered vehicles. Tractors set the seeds and bring in the silage to feed the cattle whose milk is then brought to the creamery by fossil fuel-powered trucks.  Food is brought to your premises for you to eat by fossil fuel-powered vehicles.  The Government levies taxes totalling 50% on these fuels.  How many billions of euro has it taken in tax?  Today, the Minister has said that the Government has managed to put together an &euro;11 billion package for the country and did not have to borrow a cent, but that is because it robbed that money off the country in the first place.  It robbed it off the squeezed middle.  It robbed the entrepreneurs of this country who are trying to stay in business.  When the Minister sees sorrow on the faces of children and people who can barely put food on the table this Christmas, I hope he will know that he was the cause of a lot of it.  All he does is introduce tax after tax.  If he is not taxing fuel, he is putting 23% on everything else and his Government is backing him.  Shame on them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102500041#OO00300","speaker":"1499"},{"type":"speech","time":1666724400,"counter":362,"content":"<p>I welcome the Bill.  Last week, we had the very welcome news that the bike-to-work scheme is to be extended to &euro;3,000 to enable people to purchase cargo bikes.  There is empirical evidence that cargo bikes give at least some families the option to get rid of their car or second car.<\/p> <p>Many short trips that would be taken by car can and will be taken by bike or cargo bike with this measure, as well as others the Government has introduced.  It is worth noting that nearly 40% of our transport emissions are caused by cars travelling short journeys.  These are journeys in both urban and rural areas.  These journeys, which are currently made by private car, are within the range of bike, electric bike and cargo bike.<\/p> <p> With respect to cargo bikes, the opportunity is not just for families.  There is enormous potential for last-mile delivery.  Cargo bikes come into their own in this area because they are energy efficient, they are light and nimble and they can avoid congestion.  There are negligible fuel costs.  They do not require tax or insurance and they give business owners faced with a driver shortage an opportunity to move their goods cheaply and efficiently around urban areas.  Additionally, they are a very good thing from the State's point of view because they do not cause costly wear and tear damage to road surfaces.  They improve public health and reduce congestion.  Whether it is cargo bikes, electric bikes or traditional pushbikes, and whether we are thinking of people living in Ballinamore or Ballybunion, measures to get people onto bikes, e-bikes and cargo bikes effectively reduce emissions.  I repeat what I said earlier.  Nearly 40% of all transport-related greenhouse gas emissions are caused by cars taking short journeys.  For climate reasons alone, and irrespective of the evidence that it is good for our economy, for public health, for creating better, more attractive and safer urban and rural environments, and for reducing the cost to the State in multiple ways, we should be doing everything we can to get people onto these modes of transport.<\/p> <p> The positive measures in this Bill should be just the beginning.  We have to curb drastically the sale of new fossil fuel vehicles on our roads.  Every new fossil fuel vehicle sold makes it harder for our State to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.  I do not believe we went far enough in the budget.  Electric vehicles cannot be the primary solution to the challenge we face.  The OECD report released just two weeks ago stated that with regard to our transport emissions policy, we are off track and we are not doing enough to bring about system change.  Only system change can deliver the reductions in emissions that we have set ourselves as a target.  System change sounds idealistic and unattainable but as somebody who is passionate about transport planning and urbanism, I strongly believe it is very doable and not at all as difficult as many people in this House believe.  I encourage the Minister, in all his future endeavours, to embrace system change for the benefit of our communities, our economy, our country and our environment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102500041#OO00400","speaker":"1594","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1666725000,"counter":364,"content":"<p>I welcome this Finance Bill.

I welcome the living city initiative from the Minister for Finance.  It is hugely important to us in Limerick.  The Minister has agreed to ensure security for the scheme and it is now extended up to December 2027.  It was due to finish this year.  That is five years of certainty for the scheme.  The write-off can now be over seven years rather than ten and the relief can be carried forward from year to year.  That is hugely important, along with the Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe scheme, which will have a huge benefit for the rejuvenation of Limerick city.<\/p>  <p>  I also welcome the measures around pre-letting expenses for landlords.  I just want to put that in context.  I also welcome the certainty for tenants.  Some 86% of all our landlords have one or two properties.  They are leaving the sector and we have to ask why that is.  We need them to stay in the sector.  I hope the Government will look at this in the round and give serious consideration to what can be done to ensure these small landlords stay in the sector.  They are part of the system.  As I have said many times, there are rogue landlords and rogue tenants but there are also decent landlords and decent tenants.  What we want is a system where there is a balance.  I ask the Government to look at this in the round and to find out why small landlords are leaving the sector so we can give security to both the tenant and the landlord.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102500042#PP00200","speaker":"1593"},{"type":"speech","time":1666725000,"counter":365,"content":"<p>With 200 pages to cover in two minutes, I do not think the Minister can expect an in-depth analysis of the budget from me, unfortunately.  It is very much a cost-of-living budget and this Bill underpins that.  It was a response to an unprecedented level of crisis.  Despite what Deputies across the House have asserted, I will reassert that this is progressive.  It is the third such budget passed by this Government.  The impact of the three budgets considered together is also progressive.<\/p>  <p>  I will quickly acknowledge the changes made in it in the benefit-in-kind treatment of cargo bikes, which Deputy Leddin referenced.  The Acting Chairman seemed unsure what a cargo bike is.  I have had one for six years in Waterford.  It has been a great workhorse for the family.  If I can get it up Gallwey's Hill in Tramore, I think it would be suitable for Tipperary town or Clonmel as well.<\/p>  <p>  There are changes to the taxation rules for traditional instruments.  There is nothing quite like hearing the uilleann pipes played well.  There is nothing quite like hearing them played badly either.  I have somebody learning to play the violin at home.  If he decides to take up the uilleann pipes, I will be holding the Minister personally responsible.<\/p>  <p>  In my remaining few seconds I will focus on the 50% limitation on the amount of land that can be used when establishing a solar farm without losing capital gains tax retirement relief or agricultural relief from capital acquisitions tax.  That should be looked at again.  I have read the Minister's response to Deputy Richmond's parliamentary question on this matter in November 2021.  I accept what he is saying about wanting to keep agricultural land active as we hand it over from one generation to another.  However, that misses the fact that these farms can still have an agricultural use through running sheep underneath the solar panels.  They can also have a biodiversity pay-off with wildflower meadows etc.  It is something we should look at in order to activate as much land as we possibly can for the use of solar farms.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102500042#PP00300","speaker":"1617"},{"type":"speech","time":1666725000,"counter":366,"content":"<p>Workers and families face a cost-of-living crisis that the Government has failed to respond to adequately, a reality that will become clearer in the winter months ahead.  I feel like an extra in \"Game of Thrones\" from repeating this but the reality is that for many workers and families, winter is coming.  They simply do not know how they are going to get through this winter.<\/p>  <p>  This Bill includes several so-called climate-related measures, including an increase in carbon tax on petrol and diesel.  Petrol prices have increased and diesel prices have increased.  The Government states that the cause of this is outside of its control and that international factors are contributing to the increase in petrol and diesel.  We are not disputing this.  It is how the Government responds and the measures it takes to tackle the cost-of-living crisis that are open to criticism.  Carbon Taxes are a Government policy.  Introducing carbon taxes is not a reaction to international conflicts; it is a Government decision.  Taking what we know about the price of petrol and diesel rising and workers and families being pushed to the pin of their collars, the Government decided to increase the cost of petrol and diesel by introducing carbon taxes.  Sinn F&eacute;in would not have penalised households with further tax hikes for heating their homes or running their cars.  Instead, we would have focused on the alternatives that people need to move towards in a low-carbon economy, such as delivering on retrofits that are affordable and accessible.  Carbon tax, lauded as an incentive for people to reduce carbon emissions, fails to recognise that most of those impacted have no credible alternative to their current car or heating system.  The carbon tax is simply a charge for them going about their daily business.<\/p>  <p>  The housing crisis is still the biggest issue facing people in my constituency.  Ordinary workers and families are locked out of the housing market.  Rents are through the roof in my area.  There are thousands of workers and families on never-ending waiting lists for public homes.  Homelessness and child homelessness is at an all-time high.  One of the things that really galls people in my area is seeing vacant homes on a daily basis.  These are homes that have been empty for long periods of time.  These vacant homes, which could become a home for a family, are being left empty and idle.  Sinn F&eacute;in has called for a vacant homes tax for years in the face of Government opposition.  In fairness, this Finance Bill introduces one, but it excludes derelict properties and the rate being applied for long-term vacancy calls into question how effective it will be in putting vacant housing back into use for workers and families.  Again, the Government's measures have failed to address this problem.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102500042#PP00400","speaker":"1469"},{"type":"speech","time":1666725600,"counter":367,"content":"<p>I thank the Acting Chairman for the opportunity to speak on this Bill.<\/p><p>It struck me while reading this legislation that despite Ireland being ranked as one of the wealthiest countries in the world, with a relatively strong economy, this is in no way reflected on the ground in our cities, towns or rural communities.  When I make my way to work in the morning, whether it be to Leinster House or my constituency office in Killybegs, I see no indications of living in a wealthy country or even a functioning one.  A functioning country looks after its citizens.  A functioning country does not leave its citizens cold, hungry or struggling to make ends meet.  It does not leave them abandoned in tents and crumbling houses.<\/p><p>This Government has failed its citizens time and time again and one only has to step outside this Chamber to see it.  Every local closure, every tent and every single one of the 3,071 homeless children, is a stark and daily reminder of the failures of this State.  Fine Gael, Fianna F&aacute;il and the Green Party have had an opportunity here to do something and I believe they failed yet again.<\/p><p>I see nothing of substance in this Bill.  There is nothing but temporary scheme after temporary scheme, putting a plaster on a bullet wound.  It does nothing to address the systemic change this country desperately needs but is temporarily covering up and facilitating the issues we are experiencing.<\/p><p>Section 88, for example, introduces the temporary business energy support scheme.  On the surface, this scheme is welcome for small businesses that need urgent assistance with energy bills but unfortunately, this has come far too late.  I have been contacted by a shop owner in my constituency of Donegal who has seen an incredible 118.8% increase in their energy bill, working out at an additional cost of &euro;160,000 per year.  When factoring in the increased costs in packaging and insurance, they were looking at a reduction of approximately &euro;220,000 per year in their bottom line.  This is completely unsustainable and without a doubt will force the closure of a number of local businesses in my town, throughout my constituency, and throughout the country.<\/p><p>The TBESS introduced in this Bill is too little too late.  I put it to the Minister that it is not enough to help businesses in our rural communities get by this winter.  It will however, go a long way to help big businesses and tech companies pay their bills, which will obviously be significantly higher.  That data centres, which currently account for 14% of Ireland&rsquo;s electricity usage, could be eligible for this scheme is outrageous.  It is predicted that they will account for about 28% of Ireland&rsquo;s electricity usage within the next ten years.<\/p><p>Temporary schemes, such as the TBESS and the help-to-buy scheme introduced and extended in this Bill, will only serve the system that is already failing the people of this country and will do nothing to address the energy crisis or the housing crisis that this Government is forcing its citizens to face alone.  We need targeted supports that will directly assist the people who need it most.  We need to start building more affordable homes and create incentives for landlords to prioritise long-term rentals by increasing taxation on short-term rentals such as Airbnb, and by giving them a <i>quid pro quo<\/i>for long-term rentals, perhaps by making them tax free of something like that.<\/p><p>With regard to mica, I do not see why we cannot tax the profits of the concrete industry rather than having the defective concrete blocks levy, which the Minister has now changed to 5%.  This will do little to help with funding the mica redress scheme but will drive up exponentially the cost of building during a housing crisis.  Where does the Government expect these families to live while their houses are being demolished and rebuilt?  Unless the Government is planning to take over Airbnb, there is simply nowhere for these people to go in Donegal.<\/p><p>All in all, this Bill does nothing for most in this country.  I am thinking particularly of student nurses, most of whom are just waiting for the day they get their nursing degree, leave this country and never come back.  I was in contact today with a second-year student nurse from Donegal who is studying in Trinity.  She can no longer afford to travel home to see her family due to high fuel costs and very high Dublin rent.  She works extremely long days and has very little in the way of a life outside of her work.  She is struggling with knee pain and says that most of her fellow student nurses struggle with back pain.  I must stress that these are young people in their early 20s.  She said:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIf this was any other workplace, that would be enough to bring a problem of this extent to the eyes of our Government, which is supposedly looking out for the good of this country.  I have yet to have a conversation with another student who isn't planning on leaving after college to work elsewhere.  Nursing is a profession built off of caring for people, yet we students do not feel cared for.  We feel hurt, and betrayed and we are exhausted.  We do not deserve this, the nurses before us did not deserve this and the nurses coming after us do not deserve this.  There needs to be a change in how student nurses are accommodated. <\/blockquote>  <p>I reiterate the point that Ireland is one of the wealthiest countries in the world and if we choose not to help the people who need it, it is a choice.  It is not because we could not if we wanted to, it is a choice that we make every day.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102500043#QQ00100","speaker":"1547"},{"type":"speech","time":1666725600,"counter":368,"content":"<p>While the budget sets out the fiscal parameters for next year, it is much more than that.  It also provides the framework that finances the delivery of Government policy.  This is what I want to focus on in my short contribution, namely, how this budget shaped the delivery of Government policy.  Given that my time is limited, I will concentrate on the impact of this budget on people with disabilities and on families affected by disability.<\/p>  <p>  Internationally, Ireland is seen as one of the better countries when it comes to the distributional impacts of our budgets.  If we strip out all government support and look at just wages income, Ireland is quite high on the inequality spectrum.  When we factor in our social welfare and Government supports, our levels of inequality diminish.  A central question for me in any budget, and this budget in particular, is whether this budget continued with that trend.  When one takes the once-off payments into consideration and looks at the budget in the microcosm of this one year, the answer is largely, \"Yes\".  Every budget, however, must be assessed in context.  The context is that this year's budget builds on last year's budget, and crucially, it provides the foundation for next year's budget.  Once-off payments are not part of that foundation, however.  While they are most welcome and badly needed, they are temporary.  The tax changes that will benefit the better off more than those on lower incomes are locked in but the once-off measures that provide the safety net needed by many families and individuals will be long gone by next summer.  That is not progressive.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to disability, the ESRI has conducted an analysis of the impact on disability budgeting.  The ESRI findings are clear.  Compared to inflation-proofed 2022 policies, households affected by disability will be slightly worse off in 2023.  That is the finding of the ESRI.  This includes the once-off payments.  When those payments end, the picture will be grimmer.  Those are the findings from the ESRI.  It is important also to state that the number of households affected by disability has grown by 50% since 2007.  More families are negatively impacted.  This does not take into consideration the cost of disability, which as the Minister will be aware, is hugely significant.  The Minister's own report in 2021 found that the additional cost of disability ranged from &euro;9,000 to &euro;12,500 per annum.  I note that estimate was made before the current spike in the cost of energy and the runaway inflation.<\/p>  <p>  Staying with the issues for people who have a disability, in an important point raised by one or two colleagues, when people with a disability reach the pension age, they automatically go onto the old age pension and they will be excluded from the &euro;500 payment.  The disability remains, in fact a disability often worsens as people get older, but yet they cannot access this once-off payment.  The Minister should try to see if he can find a way to change this.  Given that it is a once-off payment, the cost would not be that significant.<\/p>  <p>  In the same arena, I just want to say a few words about family carers.  Some aspects of this budget were good and one really positive aspect was that most family carers, not just those on carer's allowance, could access the once-off payment.  Yet, carer's allowance is still means tested and is still not a qualifying payment for fuel allowance.  Those two changes would make a huge difference.<\/p>  <p>  I have two small final points to make.  For third level students, the &euro;1,000 rebate is not available to graduate entry students, for example, if a student is studying medicine.  The Minister will be aware these students are already paying the full fees.  At the very least they should be able to avail of this rebate.  We need to train as many doctors as possible.  Is there any way that the Minister could look at this?<\/p> <p>Finally, many people are now really interested in renovating old or derelict homes.  Cro&iacute; Conaithe is a good scheme, especially since its extension to rural areas, but it is crucial that local authorities are adequately resourced in terms of finance and personnel to support the scheme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102500043#QQ00200","speaker":"1605","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1666726200,"counter":370,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for remaining for the whole length of the debate.  It would be remiss of me not to acknowledge the amount of work that has gone into a Finance Bill that runs to 93 sections and approximately 215 pages.  I recognise that some good steps have been taken in relation to the temporary business energy support scheme, which needs to be closely monitored, the extension of the 9% VAT for gas and electricity and the welcome move to reduce VAT on newspapers to zero, as well as many other good things in relation to once-off payments.<\/p><p>However, notwithstanding that there has been a boast of &euro;11 billion, I have been in the D&aacute;il since 2016 and have been desperately waiting, campaigning and working for a transformative budget, one which recognises that we can never go back.  Covid told us that, as did climate change and biodiversity.  I have read some of the speeches made on biodiversity on the Government side.  They are wonderful and acknowledge the seriousness of it.  That is not captured at all in the budget.  That is my difficulty with once-off payments.  The Government had to give those payments, given rising energy costs and the spiral we are caught in, but at no stage since I came in in 2016 have I seen transformative change.  I have seen the Minister's words to the effect that the planet is burning, or perhaps it was his colleague.  That was welcome in the speech last year but was not repeated this year, though the planet is burning even more.  We need transformative change; there is no going on in the same way.  When we pass a budget like this with piecemeal measures, some of which are very welcome, it is ignoring the elephant in the room, which is that we have to change whether we like it or not. <\/p><p>I can pick out anything but will pick out the help-to-buy scheme.I have raised it many times.  I have a file here.  I have read all the reports.  The Minister has in section 5 extended it for another two years.  He has not taken on any of the recommendations in the Mazars report.  If it captures anything, it captures the language used in relation to change and then there is absolutely no change.  That is what has happened here.  We have had report after report.  It was introduced and mentioned in 2016 and came into the budget via the Finance Act in operation in 2017.  In each budget it has been extended.  The estimated cost, originally, as the Minister knows much better than I, was &euro;40 million.  It looks like it will cost over &euro;1 billion by next year.  The Minister can tell me if I am wrong about the figures but I have looked at and read all of the reports.<\/p><p>I thank the Parliamentary Budget Office, which did a brilliant report.  I would love to know what the contracting out of reports costs us and what the Parliamentary Budget Office gets to do its very good reports.  Key messages are:<\/p> <blockquote> \tBy the end of 2021, the estimated total cost of approved HTB claims was &euro;559.7 million, [at that stage it was] 43% above cost estimates. ... A third of recipients did not need HTB to meet the 10% deposit ... and could instead use the scheme to create larger deposits. This could be described as &ldquo;deadweight loss&rdquo;, which means activity which would have taken place [anyway] without the tax incentive. <\/blockquote>  <p>There is much more in that but I will go to the most recent report.  I would love if the Minister had the cost of it for me.<\/p><p>I will refer to the executive summary of the Mazars report, though I have read more than that.  It is interesting that part of the logic for introducing this scheme was that the Central Bank was so strict in the criteria it laid down for what one could borrow.  It was to step into the vacuum caused by the prudence of the Central Bank.  Now we will face the situation in January where the Central Bank has altered its rules and we can borrow up to four times a salary to buy a house that none of us can afford really.  It does not make sense that we persist with the scheme for another two years at a time when the Central Bank says we can borrow away.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102500044#RR00200","speaker":"1577"},{"type":"speech","time":1666726200,"counter":371,"content":"<p>That is not what they said.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102500044#RR00300","speaker":"1558"},{"type":"speech","time":1666726200,"counter":372,"content":"<p>They said you can borrow up to four times your income.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102500044#RR00400","speaker":"1577"},{"type":"speech","time":1666726200,"counter":373,"content":"<p>Every potential borrower is still subject to the affordability test.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102500044#RR00500","speaker":"1558"},{"type":"speech","time":1666726200,"counter":374,"content":"<p>I see.  Maybe the Minister could address the point I am making, which is that the Central Bank at that time was extremely prudent and this was one of the main justifications for this scheme.  The Central Bank no longer advises prudence but says one can borrow up to four times, yet we are extending this.  When we are extending it, we are saying it had &quot;two key objectives&quot;, namely, &quot;to increase supply&quot; and &quot;to improve affordability&quot;.  It did neither, mind you.  The summary states &quot;The rationale for introducing [the] scheme [was] that [it] would boost demand&quot;, some latent demand that was not spelled out.  It goes on to give the finding that &quot;The scheme promotes demand for new housing in a market where the problems that exist are unequivocally supply constraints.&quot;  It continues:<\/p> <blockquote> \tThere were also concerns expressed when it was introduced that it can be difficult to remove schemes such as this once they have become [embedded]. This has clearly been the case [because it has] been extended a number of times ... This was not foreseen in appraisals of the scheme previously undertaken.  <\/blockquote>  <p>We do not have financial expertise here and have to use whatever wit we have to read these reports.  Here we have a complete failure to analyse this scheme at the time and make proper predictions.  The summary continues, &quot;Expenditure on the scheme has far surpassed projected values and is rising rapidly.&quot;  As I understand, it would be over &euro;1 billion at the extension time, and possibly more.  The report states, &quot;This trend appears likely to continue and may accelerate.&quot;  It is extremely relevant that it states &quot;The scheme is poorly targeted with respect to incomes, location, house prices and other socioeconomic factors ... it has socially regressive impacts, there is a considerable deadweight associated with the expenditure, and it is poorly aligned with spatial policy.&quot;  The Green Party might listen to that point of being &quot;poorly aligned with spatial policy'&quot; and so on.<\/p><p>I am grateful for the time I have had that allowed me to do that because I have wanted to do it for some time.  I advise all Deputies to read it.  The summary continues:<\/p> <blockquote> \tThe issues that were to be addressed, including the shortage of housing output and affordability ... have intensified since it was introduced with increasing deficits and higher prices [and so on]. ... The research indicates that many of the risks that were perceived... have not come to pass.  <\/blockquote>  <p>The conclusion states, &quot;There are weaknesses in the Help to Buy Scheme and it cannot be concluded that it is sufficiently efficient to represent good value for money.&quot;  That is some understatement, after that report.  After reading out all of that, that is the strongest that Mazars can come up with.  The final part I will read out states, &quot;A rational approach would not design the scheme as it currently exists&quot;.<\/p><p>That is the report on the help-to-buy scheme that the Minister held onto for a few months.  He has not told us its cost.  He published it on the day of the budget when we had little chance to read it.  I tried to read it quickly that day and have read it since.  All the reports to date have said it was poorly targeted.  The jury is out on whether it led to an increase in prices but that is because the market was rising so much anyway.<\/p><p>That is one scheme this Bill is copper-fastening for another two years without any logic behind it except it is now too big to fail, a phrase which resonates with me from the banks.  The scheme is now embedded.  It is not a rational or good one but it is embedded in Government policies.  There is the key: Government policy, which is to feed the market at all times rather than to provide public housing on public land.  We have this help-to-buy scheme, HAP, RAS, long-term leasing and all the other schemes and all the time in Galway, we have a task force that has sat for three years and should be abandoned.  I was thrilled when it came to look at the housing crisis in Galway.<\/p> <p>We have no overall vision and no city architect.  We have lands in the docks that are being dealt with by a company to maximise the price for the sale of lands there for housing that should be public housing on public land.  It is the exact same across the city and a mantra that this is good.<\/p> <p> I will finish.  I will not go over my time.

As I respond to each of these themes, I want to frame where the budget stands overall.  It is important, as some Deputies on the Government side indicated, that we make the case for the fact that our country and economy can bring forward an &euro;11 billion budget without having to borrow for it so soon after dealing with the extraordinary cost of Covid and the impact that pandemic had on our country.<\/p>  <p>  I remember in the early days of bringing in the first set of economic supports that were needed to help our country deal with the impact of Covid in 2020.  At that time in the debate the question that I had to face again and again was whether austerity was coming.  Analysts, the media and the Opposition made the case that in the aftermath of Covid the first response would be the need for austerity.  I cannot predict what the future will bring or the circumstances that could yet happen as a result of what this war may make our economy and that of Europe confront.  What I can say is that so soon after having to deal with the need to support our country in dealing with a pandemic, to be able to bring forward a &euro;11 billion budget and respond to the array of needs that our country has at a time when prices are going up so sharply does demonstrate the need to be careful with public finances and does demonstrate the value of there being resilience within our economy.  The key thing that has enabled us to do that is that at a time when corporate tax receipts went up again, from approximately &euro;11 billion in 2020 to over probably &euro;20 billion this year, the Government did not use those additional revenues to fund permanent increases in expenditure or taxation.  When it comes to spending, there was not a day that I walked into the D&aacute;il Chamber that I was not called on to do that but we did not do that.  What the Government did was that we used the increase in corporate tax revenue to fund the emergency supports that we needed to deal with the impact of Covid.  Those supports were then withdrawn as the impact of Covid on our society withdrew.  That led to our country having a surplus, which is a rare thing across Europe at the moment, and that will allow us to fund what we need to do now.<\/p>  <p>  That leads on to some of the criticisms that have been made of the budget, first, that it is not fair.  The ESRI&rsquo;s analysis and the distributional analysis of the Department of Finance on budget day showed clearly, objectively and based on evidence that those who have the least got the most in this budget as a combination of the taxation changes and particularly the social welfare changes that were brought in by the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Humphreys, and the one-off measures that have been brought in by various Departments mean that those on the lowest income and those who are most vulnerable received the most support from this budget.  This is a fair budget and a progressive budget and is shown to be in any independent analysis since.<\/p>  <p>  The second theme was continued criticism on the taxation changes brought in.  It makes me wonder what the Opposition has against someone earning around &euro;40,000.  What is it that drives the tone that the Opposition has to changes in taxation when it is continually against any kind of changes that mean someone earning &euro;40,000 or &euro;45,000, a Garda or a plumber or someone working in any part of our economy who sees their wages go above &euro;38,000, &euro;39,000 or &euro;40,000 and that they do not deserve recognition in this budget?  Because they do.  They absolutely do.  All those workers who make such a critical contribution to our country, economy and society need recognition at a time when the cost of living is going up.  I heard the point made that a person earning &euro;140,000 gets a gain but nowhere in that analysis was it said that someone earning &euro;140,000 is getting the same cash gain in the budget as someone who is earning &euro;40,000 which means that the percentage gain to someone earning &euro;40,000 is more than someone earning &euro;140,000.  This is a budget that has a particular focus in our tax code and in our tax changes on those on a middle income.  I do not believe it is appropriate, and it is something that I have wanted to change in budget after budget, that someone who is on a normal average wage in Ireland is already on the higher rate of income tax.  I believe that is worthy of change.  It is what this budget does.  The Opposition, particularly Sinn F&eacute;in, appears to be against this at every corner.<\/p>  <p>  I refer to the changes I made in the concrete levy.  Of course I was aware of the debate that happened in the aftermath of budget day.  If happens with every budget.  There is always a reaction to a particular measure, some of which deserves a response and some of which does not.  Those who are against the specifics of a concrete levy are for the generality of spending billions of euro all the time.  I remember being in this Chamber over many years and hearing debates on the need to spend more money to help those who need help; the poor families and poor property owners who have been afflicted by mica.  Those making the case for more to be spent are against any effort to look at how it could be funded.  What is as dangerous as any trade offs that can be created by a specific measure such as this is the idea that our country can spend billions of euro in the future and we need never find a way by which some of that cost can be funded.  On the trade offs behind this measure and the impact it could have on construction costs are 0.2% to 0.3% for a house and 0.15% and 0.2% for an apartment.  That is the actual change that it could deliver.<\/p>  <p>  That leads to the fourth area.  Some of the debate I heard particularly from Independent TDs and the Social Democrats suggested that all was well and good but we should really exclude the one-off measures when evaluating the budget.  I want to tease out that logic.  They say that first, we should exclude &euro;4 billion from evaluating the budget.  Second, a point made most clearly by the Independents at the end of the debate, they say that in the analysis for next year we should either say that the one-off measures should be made permanent, the very thing the think tanks and the independent institutes they quote warn us against doing - they say they should be temporary and appropriate to where the economy is at any time - or are they suggesting we do not do this at all?<\/p> <p>What is the argument they are making?  Is it to exclude &euro;4 billion from a budget or make the measures permanent, which is the very thing the bodies they quote would warn against?<\/p> <p> On the charge that the State is in some way profiting from the change in energy prices, which charge has been made by the Rural Independent Deputies, in particular, it is the case that as the price of something goes up, the VAT we collect on it does too; however, the other part of the story, which the Deputies did not go into, is that as the citizens to whom they referred spend less in our shops and economy, we collect less VAT.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102500045#SS00200","speaker":"1558","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1666727400,"counter":378,"content":"<p>A handkerchief.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102500046#TT00200","speaker":"1612"},{"type":"speech","time":1666727400,"counter":379,"content":"<p>That is a trend that could very well develop across 2023.

Unfortunately, due to decades of neglect by successive Governments, large swaths remain without quality public transport links, while some regions remain entirely cut off from our rail network.  People in rural Ireland are punished by a punitive carbon tax for having to use their car, despite the Government putting no alternatives in place for them.  The rail network we have today is a skeleton of what we had 100 years ago.  This has resulted in communities being isolated and has contributed to the stagnation of economic growth in some regions.  Sinn F&eacute;in wants to change this.  We want to see an accessible, affordable, reliable all-Ireland transport system that enables the movement of people and goods locally, regionally and nationally at the least environmental, social and financial cost.  That is at the heart of our motion tonight.  This plan could and should be implemented.<\/p><p>The motion contains a number of measures that I have raised with the Minister before and all of which are contained in our alternative budget, which we believe should be acted on.  We want to see the 20% public transport fare reduction made permanent, not just extended until the end of next year, and extended to commercial bus operators.  The latter were responsible for in the region of 30.5 million trips in 2019.  They fill a gap that the State has left open.  They provide a very important service.<\/p><p>We want to see the timeline for the delivery of the Connecting Ireland rural bus plan accelerated.  I have raised this with the Minister on numerous occasions.  I am referring to the &euro;5 million allocated in 2022 and to a &euro;56 million plan that would deliver significantly for communities if invested in and rolled out on time.  Sinn F&eacute;in would invest &euro;25 million in that plan next year.<\/p><p>We want to see funding allocated to kick-start the delivery of the western rail corridor project and expedite the delivery of the Navan rail line.  Between these two important regional projects, in the region of 2.375 million passenger journeys could be made every year, taking people out of their cars and putting them on public transport.<\/p><p>We want to see a dedicated public transport and policing unit established.  We have had much discussion on this topic.  It has included backbenchers and various Ministers and Ministers of State but we have had no progress on it.  We are aware that anti-social behaviour and crime on public transport are increasing, putting workers, including drivers, and passengers at risk.  We know the unit would be a deterrent.  According to research carried out by Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, just 15% of women in Dublin felt safe on a train and just 24%, or almost one in four, felt safe on the bus network.  This should be a genuine concern.  It needs to be addressed.  The establishment of a dedicated public transport policing unit, as called for by several unions, should be part of the solution.<\/p><p>We want to see the public transport accessibility retrofit programme budget increased year on year to bring it, in five years, to the &euro;137.5 million that is said to be needed to deliver a fully accessible public transport network with buses, coaches, light and heavy rail, and, importantly, stops, stations and platforms.  That needs to be done.<\/p><p>We want the short-hop zones extended to reduce the cost of travel for commuters who are currently excluded.  My colleague, Deputy Munster, has been particularly vocal about the anomaly that exists between Balbriggan, Gormanston, Laytown and Drogheda.  This is but one of several examples in Meath, Louth, Kildare and Wicklow.  These need to be addressed.  Sinn F&eacute;in would do so.<\/p><p>My last point, on which some of my colleagues will pick up, is that we need to see the Fine Gael agenda to privatise 10% of Dublin Bus routes to be scrapped and reversed.  The Go-Ahead experiment has failed miserably; it needs to be reversed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102500046#TT01000","speaker":"1507"},{"type":"speech","time":1666727400,"counter":387,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy O'Rourke for introducing this motion.  I call on all Deputies to support it.  The lack of reliable public transport in the north west means that households have fewer options for travel and are more dependent on their cars in order to access basic services and commute to and from work and school.  This is even more stark now as the cost of running a car has shot up.  This reflects the real cost of Government underinvestment in the north west, including my county, Donegal.  The people of the north west need to see a public transport system that delivers for our communities, one that is affordable and reliable.<\/p> <p>This is a chance to make inroads towards environmental sustainability.  That is why the Connecting Ireland plan must be accelerated.  In Sinn F&eacute;in's alternative budget, we proposed an additional &euro;195 million for the public transport system in the next year: to reduce fares, invest in new rail infrastructure, accelerate the roll-out of rural bus services and to ensure citizens have the access they deserve.<\/p> <p> There are issues specific to the north west and to Donegal that must be addressed.  Due to the lack of investment, our people are more reliant on commercial bus operators to travel, yet the 20% fare reduction that came into effect in April does not apply to commercial operators, an oversight that is clearly unfair.  Sinn F&eacute;in has been calling on the Government to extend the fare reduction to commercial operators to ensure that citizens in Donegal benefit equally.<\/p> <p> When it comes to students, we see the Government has introduced a 50% discount to young adults and student holders of Leap cards, but the discount does not apply to young people in Donegal who study or work in Derry or Belfast who go to Queens or to Coleraine, Jordanstown, Magee or elsewhere in the North.  They are being discriminated against by the Government.  The Government will tell us that the cross-Border trips cannot be included, yet a senior citizen going to Belfast is able to avail of the free travel pass.  The Government must get its act together.  This can be resolved by extending the scheme to commercial operators that provide routes to destinations in the North, and it should be done as soon as possible.<\/p> <p> One of the first questions I was asked by a fellow Senator when I was elected to the Seanad many years ago was if I got the train up.  I told him that the last time a train rolled out of Donegal was in the early 1960s.  That must be addressed, especially in light of the climate emergency.  The new all-island strategic rail review that is currently under way must have the north west at its centre.  Extending access to rail services in Donegal is crucial to empowering communities and to unlocking the potential for the people of the north west.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102500046#TT01100","speaker":"1462","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1666728000,"counter":389,"content":"<p>Accessible, reliable, affordable and safe travel is what commuters want and need in north Kildare.

Mothers - it is always mothers - in Straffan and Celbridge - say they are worried that they will have to give up work because there is no place on the school bus.

I also discussed a Topical Issue with the Minister of State, Deputy Hildegarde Naughton, a few weeks ago.  I raised the issue at the Joint Committee on Gender Equality.  I also raised it with the Taoiseach again this morning.  The reason for that is because public transport affects all aspects of our lives: how we get to work, how we get to school and how we get to health appointments.  It affects people's job opportunities.  It also affects every Department, yet there is no overall vision of how the Departments should work together to make people's lives easier.<\/p>  <p>  We had youth leaders from across the State at a climate committee meeting last Friday in the Seanad.  All of them mentioned the lack of public transport in their area.  I asked them if they intended to buy a car in the next ten years or if they thought they would need a car.  None of them said they would want a car, but that is not the way it goes if public transport is not up to the job.  In contrast, our plan would make public transport the no-brainer option because it would make public transport accessible, affordable, reliable and safe.

The motion is testament to the ambition that this party has for the public transport investment that is necessary for recruitment and the scale that is there.  People will take public transport.  They will choose it over the car if they are confident that it is reliable, safe, clean, comfortable; that it gets them where they need to go, and that it serves their community in the way that is necessary.  That is not just what people say; that is the reality, and it is what we have seen on the ground.<\/p>  <p>  In Cork in recent years, we have seen an expansion of the public transport system in a number of localities.  Where we put in the routes and services people will use them, provided they are of an adequate quality.  Bus &Eacute;ireann has expanded significantly in Cork.  At this point, however, it does not have anywhere near the staff capacity needed to meet the objectives that are being set out for it in terms of BusConnects and the additional routes.  Without additional recruitment, the State could end up looking at private contractors and tenders and all the kind of messing that we have seen in other places that we do not want to see in Cork.  There is no reason that there should not be the required recruitment in Bus &Eacute;ireann.  It can and should happen, provided the Minister signs off on it.  Bus &Eacute;ireann should be running the additional routes and services.<\/p>  <p>  I also urge the Minister of State and the NTA to be flexible and to engage meaningfully with local communities on BusConnects.  I believe it can be a success, but in order for that to happen it must bring communities with it.  It must make clear the benefits that can accrue and come to reasonable accommodations with communities.  I urge that would happen, and it can be successful provided that is done.<\/p>  <p>  The final point I want to make relates to school transport.  It is the no-brainer to end all no-brainers.  It reduces traffic at the busiest times.  It also reduces emissions, and it reduces costs for parents.  Whatever about what happened this year - there was good and bad in it in terms of costs, but the planning was inadequate - there needs to be a long-term objective of providing free school transport for everyone that wants a place.  That is not just some kind of frivolous throwaway commitment.  It makes financial, environmental and transport sense in the long run.  That should be the objective.  That is our objective, and it should be the objective of the Minister of State as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102500047#UU00300","speaker":"1460"},{"type":"speech","time":1666728000,"counter":391,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy O'Rourke for the opportunity to speak on public transport.

This has been an abject failure.  As we approach Hallowe'en, we have ghost buses in our area.  Buses that are on the schedule mysteriously disappear and leave passengers stranded.  These buses are important for getting people to work and children to school.  The 76 is also the only bus in my area that goes to Tallaght Hospital.  Someone contacted me tonight on Facebook to say they have been missing appointments because the bus has not been turning up.<\/p>  <p>  The privatisation of public transport has failed, and it must be reversed.  While there have been some improvements from Dublin Bus with the BusConnects programme, it still has its problems.  Residents in Dodsborough in Lucan, for example, feel abandoned.  Other residents in my area watch helplessly as full bus after full bus passes them by, leaving them stranded.  There also seems to be a problem at peak times, as there do not seem to be enough buses.

Charges of more than &euro;600 per year are being placed on workers just to go to work.  Liffey Valley is not served by the Luas or train and the bus routes do not cater for everyone.  The proper public transport infrastructure is not in place to warrant these car parking charges.  Shopping centres usually have a Santa Claus visit in the run-up to Christmas.  Liffey Valley has the Grinch, and much like the Grinch, these policies are green too.  I have stood on the picket line in solidarity with workers in recent weeks.

The western rail corridor has become a byword for regional development and investment in the west, and it is a significant source of frustration given the repeated failures to progress the project.

However, under existing Government policy and the previous Government's policy of privatisation, that simply is not happening.  Four years ago, 10% of the Dublin Bus fleet was privatised and handed over to a private operator, Go-Ahead Ireland.  Since that time, it has been a disaster.  I have stood here in this House many a time, in front of the Minister of State and her departmental colleague, raising the serious issues relating to Go-Ahead, which has left communities completely isolated, abandoned and simply forgotten.<\/p>  <p>  In Wicklow, three routes were privatised, namely, the 45A, the 185 and the 184.  Not a day goes by when somebody is not in touch with me to complain that the bus simply did not show up or was cancelled or that the driver had changed the route, with the passengers on board, because it was running behind schedule and had to make up time.  It simply is not working.  Yesterday evening, for example, on one of those routes, the 45A, seven buses were cancelled.  That was on just one bus route in Wicklow, but it is a daily occurrence.  Privatisation simply has not worked; it has failed.  I ask the Minister of State and her colleague the Minister for Transport to act now, revoke the licence that was issued to Go-Ahead, take it back under public control and ownership and let Dublin Bus do what it does best, namely, run the bus service that is fit for purpose and will serve the communities it is supposed to serve.<\/p>  <p>  Wicklow is also a constituency that has been failed by the extension of the short-hop zone.  The short-hop zone goes as far as Kilcoole.  I have raised continuously the need to extend it as far as Arklow but the answer I get back from the NTA and the Minister is that it will not be considered because too many people would use it.

I thank Deputies for the opportunity to speak to the House about the importance of accessible, affordable and reliable public transport.  I am confident we can all agree it is essential that the Government continue to invest in our public transport network and that we are supportive of the Government&rsquo;s commitment to delivering an accessible, affordable and reliable public transport network throughout the country.  While the Government will not oppose the motion and its overall objective is broadly in line with the principles of the Government, it contains some issues that require clarification and they will be highlighted in the ministerial contributions.<\/p>  <p>  It is a key Government objective to provide all citizens with reliable and realistic sustainable mobility options and public transport plays a key role in delivering that.  To support this objective, in budget 2022, the Department of Transport secured &euro;538 million in funding for public service obligation, PSO, and Local Link services provided by State operators and under contract by the NTA this year.  More recently, &euro;563 million has been secured as part of the budget 2023 negotiations for the continuation of these services.  To incentivise young people to use public transport, the Minister for Transport secured funding for the introduction of a young adult card, which allows anyone nationwide between the ages of 19 and 23 to avail of a 50% discount on all PSO services and since September, also on participating commercial services.  This initiative was recently widened to allow 16- to 18-year-old third level students to apply for the student Leap card in order that they too can avail of the discount.  Furthermore, to combat the rising cost of living being experienced throughout the country, the Government introduced fare reductions of 20% on average on PSO services.  Funding has been secured in budget 2023 for the continuation of the young adult card on PSO and commercial services, as well as retaining the 20% average fare discount on PSO services.  These fare initiatives are making a significant positive difference to people&rsquo;s lives throughout the country and their continuation in 2023 represents a significant investment by the taxpayer in public transport.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to short-hop zones, given the current cost-of-living crisis and various pressures on the Exchequer throughout the system, budget 2023 is focused on delivering the maximum benefit for all passengers.  Funding was directed, therefore, towards the fare initiatives I outlined rather than any narrow application to specific issues that can arise with some fares at the edges of the current short-hop zones.  These issues are acknowledged, however, and the NTA is examining what needs to be done to ensure the distance-based fare outside the short-hop zone is in line with the distance-based fare inside the short-hop zone to ensure the fares will be more equitable.  This work is ongoing as part of a national fares review for rail and bus services.<\/p>  <p>  The Government is committed to providing a comprehensive national transport network that connects our people and places throughout Ireland.  For this reason, the Government has an ambitious vision to transform transport services and infrastructure nationwide, with one of the key priorities for public transport being the roll-out of the Connecting Ireland rural mobility plan.  The House will be aware that Connecting Ireland will significantly increase both the number of routes and the frequency of existing services throughout the country.  It aims to enhance existing services and introduce new public transport services.  On 19 July, the NTA announced the Connecting Ireland programme&rsquo;s phase 1 implementation plan, which has delivered a mix of new and enhanced bus services on routes and services serving areas in counties Cavan, Monaghan, Donegal, Clare, Sligo, Kildare, Offaly, Mayo, Laois, Limerick, Tipperary, Louth and Wexford.  Over the coming weeks, the NTA plans to implement improvements to levels of service on a further 14 services throughout the State.  Implementation of the programme at the pace outlined by the Government and in line with the funding and operational resources available.<\/p>  <p>  Regarding our rail network, the strategic rail review being undertaken in co-operation with the Department for Infrastructure in Northern Ireland will inform the development of interurban, interregional rail on the island of Ireland over the coming decades.  The review will set the type of strategic backdrop to rail investment in our regions and on our mainline network and is expected to be completed by the end of the year.<\/p> <p>This review will also consider the potential scope for improved rail services along the various existing or future potential corridors of the network.  That scope will include the potential afforded by disused and closed lines.  It will be one of the most significant reviews of the rail network on the island in many years and will provide a framework to develop a much-improved rail network in the years ahead.<\/p> <p> With regard to the Navan rail line, the NTA's draft transport strategy for the greater Dublin area is recommending the development of a rail link to Navan by 2042.  This project will require significant planning and design before construction can commence.  As it stands, the draft strategy proposes delivery of the Navan rail line in the latter half of the strategy period between 2031 and 2042.<\/p> <p> With regard to the issue of establishing a dedicated public transport policing unit, as this House will be aware, antisocial behaviour is a broad societal issue we are currently facing to which public transport is not immune.  The safety and security of both public transport passengers and staff, including arrangements to deal with antisocial behaviour, are important matters that first and foremost must be managed by every public transport company in conjunction with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, where appropriate.  It is important to note that any decisions regarding the establishment of a transport police unit and the allocation of Garda resources are matters for the Minister for Justice and the Garda Commissioner.  That said, the NTA regularly engages with public transport operators on the issue of antisocial behaviour and has established a working group on antisocial behaviour that meets monthly to discuss any developing trends among public transport operators and to share best practices.<\/p> <p> The Minister for Transport is fully committed to strengthening our public transport offerings and progressively making them accessible for all.  This requires a whole-journey approach, which refers to all elements that constitute a journey from the starting point to destination.  It also means applying the principles of universal design.  As the House will be aware, the Department of Transport and its agencies are progressively making public transport accessible for disabled people by ensuring new infrastructure and services are accessible from the start and by retrofitting older infrastructure and facilities to make them accessible.  Accessibility features such as wheelchair accessibility and audiovisual aids are built into all new public transport infrastructure projects and vehicles from the design stage.  Newer systems such as the Luas are fully accessible, as are all new buses purchased by the NTA.<\/p> <p> The public transport accessibility retrofit programme has increased from an average of &euro;7 million over the past four years to &euro;15.3 million for 2022.  This will be used to ensure continued works to improve accessibility at train stations, bus stations and stops.  A sum of &euro;18 million has been invested over four years to replace or renovate the lifts at the train stations.  All of the major public transport companies consult persons with disabilities, individuals and representative organisations through the companies' disability user groups.  The user groups provide a forum for operators to consult and update disability organisations on accessibility proposals and developments and for disability organisations to raise operational and other accessibility issues.<\/p> <p> With regard to the call for the NTA to exercise its regulatory powers to ensure punctuality, reliability and customer service standards are met by all public transport operators and providers, I would like to clarify that the NTA uses all the contractual and regulatory powers available to it to measure, report on and seek to maintain and improve standards across public service obligation, PSO, transport services.  In instances where performance drops, financial penalties are rigorously applied unless the cause of the loss of performance is outside of the control of the operator, for example, high levels of Covid sickness absence.  In recent months, all bus operators have faced challenges in maintaining adequate staff numbers to cover all requirements.  The NTA has worked collaboratively with all operators to try to mitigate the impact of these staff shortages.  However, the summer months were challenging, with performance deductions applied to a number of operators, as per all PSO contracts.  In recent weeks, performance standards have improved although there remains a shortage of driving and maintenance staff, which will take some time to resolve fully.  With regard to PSO contractual arrangements between the NTA and Go-Ahead Ireland, the current contracts with Go-Ahead are regularly  reviewed by the NTA, as with all PSO contracts.  Whether tendered or directly awarded, all decisions relating to contract extensions or renewals will be made following a detailed assessment of a number of factors, including the performance of the operator over the duration of the contract in question.<\/p> <p> On behalf of the Minister, Deputy Ryan, this motion is generally in line with the principles of this Government in terms of prioritising investment in the public transport network.  As I outlined, however, some elements of the motion do not properly reflect the progress to date in this area, the work currently underway or the Government's future plans for public transport.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102500048#VV00300","speaker":"1578","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1666729200,"counter":397,"content":"<p>The proposals Sinn F&eacute;in have are for a detailed plan for a reliable public transport service.  If we want people to use public transport, however, we first need to provide the proper infrastructure.  I have raised the issue of bus shelters many times.  Borris-in-Ossory and Castletown on the R445 need bus shelters.  I raised this issue numerous times with the NTA and the Department.  They are also needed at Ballyline, Newtown and Crettyard on the N77.  In weather like we had over the past week or so, people have been standing in spilling rain waiting for a bus, which does not entice people onto public transport.  It is an issue that needs to be addressed.  Funding was approved earlier this year for five bus shelters at Ballybrittas in County Laois, Kilminchy in Portlaoise and two more at Mountrath.  Laois County Council is ready to proceed but the NTA needs to engage with the council to get those shelters in place.  I spoke to the council again about this no later than this morning.  Funding has been approved.  The NTA needs to engage with the council.  This is fundamental infrastructure.  Local authorities do not have the authority to procure and install it.  I want the Minister of State to take this back.  Under the local government legislation that was brought forward by the Minister at the time, Mr. Phil Hogan, that power was to be devolved down, not just to designate bus stops but actually to put bus shelters in place.  It can be devolved down.  It needs the Minister with responsibility for local government to act on it.  It is too slow and cumbersome when a local authority has to go through the NTA to get a bus stop erected, which the Minister of State will appreciate.  It is one of the things we can do.<\/p>  <p>  We want to extend the 20% public transport fare reduction, which I welcome, to all commercial bus operators.  That is not the case that the moment.  This is important on rural and regional routes such as those to and from Laois-Offaly.  Many people have to use the private operators, as I have done.  People should not be denied the 20% reduction.  That needs to be spread out across all providers.  We are proposing that the Connecting Ireland scheme is provided with an additional &euro;25 million to deliver the roll-out to rural areas.  This will mean a reliable transport service for workers in counties Laois and Offaly.  It is needed in the morning and evening to get people to and from work and to connect the smaller towns and villages with larger towns like Tullamore and Portlaoise.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, we need a safe public transport system.  We are calling for the establishment of a dedicated public transport policing unit.  A recent report found that 77% of women outside of Dublin felt it was unsafe to use the train.  The Portlaoise to Ballybrophy line to Dublin has been identified as having recurring problems.  The security guards do not have the powers to arrest.  We need garda&iacute;.  We need special dedicated Garda units with powers of arrest on those lines to make our public transport safe.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102500049#WW00200","speaker":"1491"},{"type":"speech","time":1666729200,"counter":398,"content":"<p>I commend my colleague, Deputy O'Rourke, on bringing forward this motion.  Public transport needs to be accessible, reliable and safe for people.  Accessibility is certainly one of the issues raised in this motion with regard to the western rail corridor for people living in my region in the west and in the Minister of State's region.  It is one of the big factors that could be a game changer for that part of the country.  If it were complete, it would revolutionise the whole system across the west and north west to be able to provide public transport in that region.<\/p>  <p>  A big issue we have, which we come across regularly, is the reliability of bus services, particularly the Bus &Eacute;ireann service.  People have to book online to get on the bus and then, because the bus is booked up, they arrive at a bus stop and wait.  The bus comes driving up and they discover there are ten or 20 empty seats, but the bus driver says, \"Sorry, those seats are already booked\".  The bus has to drive on and leave them on the side of the road.  That is happening regularly throughout the country.  That is a real problem that needs to be dealt with.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to the issue of safety, numerous people in my area have contacted me about problems on the train going from Sligo to Dublin.  On other train services, especially here in the city of Dublin, there is the whole issue of what is often termed \"antisocial behaviour\".  It is much more serious than that, however.  It is not antisocial behaviour.  These are actually attacks.  It is brutality that is happening to people.  We have had issues of bus drivers being attacked.  The real problem is we need to accept that if we are going to make public transport one of the main facets of our society, we have to make it safe for people.  The only way that can be done is to have a dedicated public transport police service in place throughout the State, but particularly in our urban areas.<\/p> <p>That needs to happen as a matter of urgency.  I note the Minister of State mentioned this in her speech and said it is a matter for the Minister for Justice and the Garda Commissioner.  The reality is it is past the stage of considering this now.  We need to put that provision in place and do it as a matter of urgency.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102500049#WW00300","speaker":"1607","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1666729800,"counter":400,"content":"<p>I thank my colleague Deputy O'Rourke for bringing this very important motion to the D&aacute;il floor.  Our island's public transport system is staffed by tens of thousands of hard-working men and women and I acknowledge that.  The 2016 census recorded 13.5% of the population as having a disability.  People with a disability or those with mobility challenges all too often face barriers using public transport such as broken lifts in train stations, limited wheelchair spaces or having to give 24 hours' notice to have a ramp in place.  We need investment to make sure we have wheelchair access at all train stations, platforms and bus stops.  This must be a priority for us all.<\/p>  <p>  The transport sector accounted for 17.7% of our greenhouse gas emissions in 2021 and this must fall by 50% over the next eight years from the 2018 baseline if we are to meet our overall reduction target of 51% by 2030.  About half of all transport emissions originate from the passenger car fleet, highlighting the urgent need to invest in public transport.  In my own county of Meath we have the NX bus service covering Navan and Johnstown.  Commuters who rely on these services are fed up to the teeth of the poor services being delivered.  Late buses, no-shows, overcrowding, antisocial behaviour and generally poor service are commonplace on these routes.  This is causing serious problems for people who rely on these buses and very little is being done to fix it.  These ongoing issues, if not fixed, will drive people away from using public transport.  Schoolchildren also struggle to get to their destinations as many have been left behind in the issuing of concessionary tickets.  Bus &Eacute;ireann has received more than 50 emails from me but only one has been answered.  Mostly it sends automated responses.  It is a joke.<\/p>  <p>  Our motion also calls for the delivery of the Navan rail line.  Re-establishing the rail connection to Navan will benefit commuters, businesses, tourism and the environment, ending the commuting nightmare for many, and will take thousands of cars off our roads each day.  It has been estimated this line has the potential to facilitate up to 1.8 million passenger journeys per year.  The Minister of State needs to come to Navan and meet me and Deputy O'Rourke.  We will meet with commuters who cannot wait until 2031 for this project to start.  Planning must start today, as we have allowed for in our alternative budget.  A Sinn F&eacute;in Government would deliver the Navan rail line starting today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102500050#XX00200","speaker":"1506"},{"type":"speech","time":1666729800,"counter":401,"content":"<p>Many people from rural communities such as my own constituency of Cavan-Monaghan who, through necessity, commute to the large urban centres such as Dublin, are heavily reliant on private cars due to the lack of public transport options in rural Ireland.  Where they do exist, they can often be very unreliable, leaving commuters stranded in the rain and cold waiting for the next bus, hoping it will not be full.  There is an hourly bus service from Cavan to Dublin but the issue is capacity, especially with the evening services.  Regularly buses are at capacity when they reach the last stop out of Dublin at Blanchardstown and they have to leave people behind to wait an hour for the next bus, which often is also at capacity.  People have told me they sometimes end up getting home two to three hours later than anticipated.  There is a clear need for an additional service on that route.  There is no proper shelter at that location either.<\/p>  <p>  People living in more rural areas depend on the Local Link to provide public transport.  It can be very sketchy across Cavan and Monaghan.  I will acknowledge there are some areas well serviced by it.  In my own area of Kilnaleck and Ballyjamesduff there are people constantly looking for a service into the county town.  We have two services, one on a Thursday and one on a Saturday.  It is not sufficient.  Cavan-Monaghan Local Link has applied for resources to activate new routes from those areas but they have not yet been approved by Transport for Ireland.  I am hoping they will be approved in the very near future.  If affordable, accessible and reliable public transport infrastructure were expanded across the island, it would deliver social and economic benefits to all our cities, town and regions and would also meet our obligations in reducing our carbon emissions.<\/p>  <p>  These issues are worse still for people with disabilities who face multiple barriers to using public transport such as broken lifts, having to give notice before their journeys so that a ramp is put in place, and limited wheelchair places on buses.  For the State to align the public transport system with the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, UNCRPD, there is a need to make it universally accessible.  To this end, the public transport accessibility retrofit programme budget needs to be increased to ensure accessibility at all train stations, platforms and bus stops.  There need to be annual targets for retrofitting of older public transport infrastructure with reports measuring progress against these targets.<\/p>  <p>  My colleague Deputy Pearse Doherty referred to a rail system in Donegal and said the last train to leave Donegal was in the early 1960s.  The same applies to Cavan.  It was probably the same train service that used to go through Cavan and on to Donegal.  Those counties are now all left without a train service for that length of time.  The Minister of State said the Navan railway line would be extended in 20 years' time.  That needs to be addressed in a much shorter period.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102500050#XX00300","speaker":"1513"},{"type":"speech","time":1666729800,"counter":402,"content":"<p>I am delighted to speak on the motion, which has many wonderful and admirable asks which we have all been hearing from our constituents throughout the country, be it the western rail link to Donegal or rural transport in general.  One thing I would like to focus on is the issue of security on our transport services.  On social media in recent days we have seen an incident that took place on Amiens Street outside Connolly station or at the Amiens Street bus stops at the intersection with the Luas.  It is a very busy transport node.  There was an incident of what seemed like young men having a running fight.  The video is 20 or 30 seconds long.  It is another in a long line of videos that are quite disturbing and show a level of violence that would make anyone in the vicinity feel very frightened.  I saw one of the videos was shot from a bus.  People who were on public transport would have felt paralysed and, if these people had forced their way onto the bus, they would have been in a difficult situation.  We have had calls for transport policing and the motion contains a call for a transport policing unit.  We need to tease that out.  What does it look like?  Is this a unit of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na?  If transport policing is to be part of the overall solution, it should be part of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  On the Luas, for example, we have private security operators who are dressed like Robocop, as I would describe it.  They do not add overall to a degree of security.  They look quite militarised and like they are tooled up and generally I feel they add to feeling unsafe.<\/p>  <p>  What I would like to see in the first instance all across our transport sector is an increase in ordinary transport workers, be they workers at train stations or inspectors on buses, which we used to have.  They were good, well-paid, traditional transport jobs with good conditions.  That is something we have seen shrink over the years.  We have gone from stations that had staff to making a virtue out of staffless stations with an electronic unit where people can swipe their cards and all that.  We need to get back to having staffed stations and transport nodes and having inspectors on buses before we get to the stage of having a tooled-up transport policing unit.  Overall that leads to an increase of securitisation in our transport infrastructure when we should be looking at attracting workers to the traditional roles across Irish Rail, Dublin Bus and all our transport operators.  Ultimately, if we have a transport policing solution, we will not be able to have security guards on every bus in every town and city in Ireland.  It is a deeper problem.  It is an easy thing to say we need a transport police and maybe there does have to be a role for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and some kind of multidepartmental or cross-sectoral approach in terms of security.<\/p>  <p>  We should start with hiring back staff and having better staff levels, having people working on our platforms who are able to assist those with disabilities when they find themselves, as they all too often do, unable to access trains or to get on buses.  Another part of this motion is something my party and many other Opposition parties have called for, which is ensuring people with disabilities are prioritised in our transport system.  Buses that are being purchased into our fleets now are required to have proper accessibility.<\/p> <p>However, I have spoken to wheelchair users who still have difficulties accessing these modern buses.  In some cases, their wheelchairs are so big and difficult to manoeuvre that, even if they can get onto a bus, it means that bus is full from another disabled person's point of view.  We are getting fleets of buses that may be accessible for many people with disabilities but only for one of them at a time.  If someone is waiting further down the line, that bus will drive past.  There is much more to be done before we have a truly accessible public transport service.<\/p> <p> Previous contributors spoke about the western rail corridor and the rail link to Donegal.  I will speak about something a little closer to home, namely, the MetroLink project.  I am delighted the railway order has gone to An Bord Plean&aacute;la and is out for public consultation.  I have spoken many times about why this project is important and that point has been well made.  I want to focus on another element, which is how these big projects are important, not just in and of themselves and not just to meet our climate targets but also in how they impact on the delivery of other projects.  In the case of MetroLink - the same thing is played out in other parts of the country - the ramifications of a project that is so long in the pipeline is that other projects, including accessibility measures, transport measures and other things local authorities should be doing, are put on hold indefinitely.<\/p> <p> Such projects include micro-local issues like the Pinnock Hill roundabout in Swords, which has no safe crossing such as a bridge over it like there is on other roundabouts, traffic lights or a pedestrian junction.  There is a hole in the bush in the middle of the dual carriageway through which commuters trying to get from Swords village, where they have been left off by the bus, must make their way to get to work in Airside Retail Park.  They have to dash across two lanes of traffic to get to the median and the hole in the bush.  Coming from the other way, there are school-goers travelling from the Holywell estate, which has more than 2,500 houses and apartments, trying to get to the school on Main Street.  Fingal County Council refuses to invest in Pinnock Hill roundabout because it is waiting for MetroLink to be delivered.  It does not want to have to rip up infrastructure at a cost of a couple of hundred thousand euro, &euro;1 million or however much it will be because it is waiting for the &euro;1 billion project to come down the stream.  Fingallians GAA Club is located a couple of roundabouts up from Pinnock Hill roundabout but it cannot expand its pitch because it is waiting for the distributor road for Swords.  I know roads are very unfashionable at the moment but the need for a distributor relief road is part of the long-term planning for Swords.  Again, that project cannot proceed until the big MetroLink project is delivered.  These projects are important.  It is not all about the statement projects on which a Taoiseach, T&aacute;naiste or Minister for Transport will cut the ribbon down the line.  They are holding up other, smaller but very important projects that are necessary to deliver accessibility, active travel and good community infrastructure.<\/p> <p> The issues relating to Go-Ahead Ireland and the privatisation of our transport system, which affect commuters in Dublin, Kildare and north Wicklow, are something we have raised a number of times over recent months.  They have been raised countless times by my colleague, Corina Johnston, our representative in Donabate-Portrane.  Councillor Robert O'Donoghue, too, has raised the issues with the services in our area.  I met with people from Go-Ahead Ireland a couple of weeks ago in Ballymount and expressed to them in person our utter dissatisfaction with the service that is currently being provided.  They made their case in regard to staffing issues and all the rest but the fact is there are staff in businesses all over the greater Dublin area who are unable to make it to work on time because this service is failing at such a level.<\/p> <p> As the Minister of State mentioned, the fines are large, they have been applied and the companies are paying them, but they seem to be able to afford to do so.  They are not going any way to improving their services.  In fact, the services seem to have deteriorated.  All across public transport, in State companies, private companies and school transport providers, there is a difficulty in hiring and retaining workers, including drivers.  Many issues are at play but one that is a common undercurrent to all of this, in transport, the health service and elsewhere, is that the ability to afford to live in and around Dublin and other major cities - indeed, anywhere in the country - is becoming so difficult because of the price of housing that people are unable to afford to take a job as a bus driver, whether for Dublin Bus, Bus &Eacute;ireann, Go-Ahead Ireland or any other transport company.  That is where we are at this point.  What was traditionally a good, secure, well-paid job with good conditions, which enabled people to have a family, take a holiday, enjoy Christmas and run a home, no longer exists as a result of the suppression of wages and conditions.  If we really are to improve our public transport system and our transport system in general, we need to value those workers and the jobs they do and pay them accordingly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102500050#XX00400","speaker":"1564","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1666730400,"counter":404,"content":"<p>I thank Sinn F&eacute;in for bringing forward this motion.  It is not possible to separate land use from transport planning and we must look over a long horizon to see what the trends are.  In the mid-1990s, there was scenario testing for how the greater Dublin area was going to develop.  It was intended that there would be a greater concentration of development in the city centre and, further out, there would be balanced regional development.  In 1996, Dublin city accounted for 13% of the national population.  The combined populations of the Fingal, South Dublin and D&uacute;n Laoghaire areas accounted for 15% of the population, while the combination of Kildare, Meath and Wicklow accounted for 9% of the national total.<\/p>  <p>  That combination largely makes up the greater Dublin area and we can see how it has changed if we look at the 2022 figures.  Dublin city has reduced its share of the national population from 13% to 11% over those 25 years.  Fingal, South Dublin and D&uacute;n Laoghaire make up 16% of the total, up from 15% in 1996, albeit it is now a much larger population.  The three outer counties of Meath, Kildare and Wicklow make up 12% of the national population in 2022.  That is an increase from 9% in 1996, which is the converse of what was planned for from a transport perspective.  This is what has happened following the big investments that were made over that time.<\/p>  <p>  We are dealing now with the reality rather than the ideal.  The reality is that housing policy is responsible for the change that has occurred.  Unfortunately, we are seeing that some of the investments being made do not really recognise that reality.  Some of that failure is operational and some is on the design side but largely it is about how we match land use and transportation planning.  Major investments have been made in BusConnects, for example, with three spines rolled out so far.  The second, the C spine, runs along the N4 and into north Kildare.  While that works for some people, it certainly does not work for others.  There are a lot of people back in their cars and very frustrated with what has been provided.  This is not just a bedding-in issue.  It is the situation almost a year after the project was delivered.  I reiterate that it works well for some commuters but it is most definitely not working for others.  The NTA does not want to hear that.<\/p>  <p>  Other speakers referred to the services provided by Go-Ahead Ireland.  That company got the contract in Kildare for the first group of Bus &Eacute;ireann services that were privatised.  There has been nothing but complaints since that happened.  We have seen people have to change their jobs, be forced back into their cars and miss medical appointments and we have seen students miss examinations.  I acknowledge there were problems with all the providers, with fines being issued across the board, but the worst offender by far was Go-Ahead Ireland.  While the service was less than perfect before, the unreliability since that company took over has been absolutely disgraceful.  The service has improved in Kildare in recent weeks following constant complaints.<\/p> <p>We are nearly afraid to even mention it because it has been a constant problem.  It is the same in parts of County Wicklow.  Places like Enniskerry and Newtownmountkennedy need to be linked to the larger urban areas like Bray and D&uacute;n Laoghaire if public transport is to be viable.  If the links do not work, public transport does not work.  I do not know what kind of assessment was done in advance of that service being privatised.  A capacity review certainly seems to be lacking.  I do not know what the NTA was thinking about.  From the complaints I have received, I know that it has been a huge source of frustration.  It is going to be very difficult for people to ever trust that service.  When people go back to using their cars, it is hard to get them on public transport again.<\/p> <p> It was reported last week that 30% of students arriving to UCD from within 6 km are arriving by car.  Why might that be?  I met with representatives of the Union of Students in Ireland and the welfare officer on the day that report was published in the media, and I specifically sought to talk to them about public transport.  One of the key issues raised was the unreliability of bus services, including the number 17 service, which is provided by Go-Ahead.  I was told that it is a service that is there in theory, but is so unreliable that students have given up on it or they are taking a much more circuitous route to college, and perhaps driving there.  We have got to look at what is not working there.  Due to the housing crisis, students are often travelling form further afield to all colleges, so the availability and reliability of public transport has become a key issue.  It has even become a welfare issue.  While the 20% reduction in fares and an even greater reduction for the under 25s is very welcome, it is not much use if it cannot be used.  <\/p> <p> I return to the C spine issue.  When delivering a spine on the BusConnects network, we must get it right before rolling out the next one.  We decided to do a survey in north Kildare to see if the complaints we were getting were representative.  Some 1,200 people took part in the survey, online and in-person.  The in-person aspect was interesting because quite a few people politely refused to take part because they said the bus service no longer met their needs.  We submitted the results to the NTA, but I do not believe it has the inclination to change anything, given the reply it sent to me.  More than 100 people turned to a public meeting a few weeks ago, and I received dozens of apologies.  We would really rather not be doing this, but we have another public meeting planned for the anniversary of the introduction of the C spine, to which the NTA and Dublin Bus have been invited.  One of the key issues to be raised is that the peak time services, both morning and evening, need to be expanded.  The evening peak ends too early and the morning peak does not start early enough.  There are capacity and reliability issues, with people being left at bus stops, real-time information does not reflect the reality, and some buses do not show up at all.  The real-time information is provided from Broadstone, the link buses are provided from Phibsborough, and the spine services are provided from Ringsend.  They are not talking to each other.  They do not match up.  The bus stop on Wellington Quay is regarded as unsafe.  People are not using the bus services because of that safety issue.  There are also other bus stop safety issues.  Buses are very overcrowded at peak times, with limited space.  The fact that train times are not linked with bus times and are not synchronised makes public transport unattractive.  The alternative services that were there previously were meeting requirements, but some of them are not currently.  I accept that there are plenty of people that the services work well for, but they have to work well for people in general.  We cannot have locations where they do not work.<\/p> <p> I reiterate the points that have been made in relation to disability access to public transport.  There is a real challenge for people, particularly on rail services, where the lifts are frequently out of order.  Safety on public transport has to be assured.  Otherwise, people will not use it.  On the services that are currently provided through the NTA, a desktop exercise is done in relation to the service provision, where previously, the likes of Dublin Bus used to go out once a year and count the number of people who were left at the bus stops.  That does not happen now.  It is a desktop exercise.  Counting the number of tickets does not provide the other information about who is not getting on the bus.  There is also a need to look at how many people are getting back in their cars as a consequence of issues with the public transport services provided.  I must say that some of the things that I would have expected to be improvements have not been improvements.  It is a huge disappointment to someone like me, who is very pro public transport.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102500051#YY00200","speaker":"1489","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1666731000,"counter":406,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 1:<\/p> <blockquote> \tTo insert the following after &quot;reduce the cost of travel for commuters currently excluded&quot;:  \t&quot;&mdash; public transport fares to be abolished from the start of 2023, including for commercial bus and rail operators, and investment to ensure free public transport is also fast and frequent&quot;.  <\/blockquote>   <blockquote> \tI thank Sinn F&eacute;in for bringing forward this motion.  It is good to have the opportunity to talk about this hugely important issue.  It is evident, from the contributions of all of the Deputies who have spoken, that we have a problem with the delivery of public transport.  People do not make up these stories and moan about the NTA, the BusConnects or the trains just for the sake of it.  These are real issues for the people that we represent in our constituencies.  The first issue that I want to address from the motion is access and disability access.  As has been said by many here, it is a hugely important issue.  We have seen many people facing barriers to access to public transport, including broken lifts at DART stations, limited wheelchair spaces on buses, trains, and on the DART and the Luas, and the requirement to give 24 hours' notice before a journey in order for a ramp to be put in place.  These are real live issues for people who struggle at the best of times with their mobility.  I must congratulate the Access for All campaigners, many of whom I know.  They are people with disabilities and the parents of people with disabilities, who are doing their utmost to shine a light on this very important issue.<br \/><br \/>The second issue I wish to raise, which is not really explicitly mentioned in the motion but is hinted at, and has been hinted at throughout the debate, is the role of the NTA itself.  I worked for Dublin Bus.  I remember that there were constant attempts by the State and the governments of the day to privatise the public transport system.  It was a mantra of Fine Gael, in particular.  It really wanted to see privatisation in public transport.  It was met with huge resistance, mainly from workers like me and the good strong trade unions that we had.  The NTA was brought in specifically to privatise public transport.  That is the only role it has ever played.  It had an elaborate structure of competitive tendering, just like we have for offshore energy for renewables, for our hospitals and for everything we do.  It is a very neo-liberal idea that the only way we can deliver services is by privatising some of them and looking for the lowest tenderer.  When you get the lowest tenderer, you get a company like Go-Ahead, a British company that is renowned over there for treating and paying its workers poorly.  If the NTA had only done its research, it would have found that out.  Stories have been told all around this Chamber today about what is wrong with Go-Ahead.  There is a lot wrong with the NTA.  What it has done with BusConnects is very interesting.  From the time BusConnects was announced, as a councillor, along with other People Before Profit councillors, I engaged very strongly with the organisation.  BusConnects will confirm that we had the representatives driven mad.  We went to all the public consultations, met with representatives and had Zoom conferences with them.  They produced very elaborate and beautiful documents, maps and files that could be plugged into a computer.  There were interactive maps that showed us how BusConnects would work.  I would say that millions of euro were spent on that.  In fact, I think I put in a parliamentary question on the millions of euro that were spent on just planning the BusConnects network.  Now that we have it, I welcome 24-hour transport and many of the spines that bring more frequency on the principal routes, for example, from west Dublin into the city.  That is all very good. <\/blockquote> <p>However, those routes bypass large working class areas such as lower Ballyfermot.  For years, the No. 79 bus would pass through the area frequently, every 15 to 20 minutes, picking up mothers, babies, people in wheelchairs, grannies and all sorts of people who needed the service.  Those are genuine working class people who depend on public transport because they do not have the option of using cars and do not have sufficient mobility to walk for 15 minutes to the main road to catch the G1 or G2 buses.  This new route is wrecking some of their lives.  I have heard reports of women who have struggled to make it into work on time because of the bottleneck created by the No. 60 route which replaced the No. 79.  They are delayed in waiting for the bus to come and also by the bottleneck that is created in Kilmainham, which adds 45 or 50 minutes to the journey.  Many of those women are arriving into work so late that their wages are being docked.  It is unacceptable.  I would like the Ministers and those sitting on the Government benches to provide instruction to the National Transport Authority to the effect that where the system is not working, it must try to fix it.  Trying to fix it means consulting local people and their representatives, including Deputies.  The NTA must try to fix the problems and it must listen.<\/p> <p> When I worked in Dublin Bus, workers were consulted regularly about how the routes should work.  We knew what time the factories and schools emptied.  We knew what time the women came out to go into town and clean the offices.  We knew when old folks would need buses to get to hospitals.  There is no longer any consultation with local people on these issues.  There is a plan in the heads of these people, a layer of whom come to those Zoom meetings.  Loads of different people attend.  They are well-paid experts who can tell us about this route which runs however many kilometres.  The talk about this, that and the other, and all the computerised technology they have.  However, delivering a proper transport service requires listening to local people.<\/p> <p> I have moved the People Before Profit amendment to provide for free public transport.  For years, People Before Profit has championed the idea of free frequent public transport.  I hope Sinn F&eacute;in will accept our amendment and vote with us on it because free public transport is not only people asking for more stuff for free, as some neoliberals would say.  They would say it is just the socialists again for whom everything must be free and ask who will pay for it.  Free public transport is a modern, global and well caught-on concept.  Where it has been introduced, the intention is to reduce emissions, improve air quality and get cars off the road.  It is a crucial tool for reducing CO2 greenhouse gas emissions.  We must think long and hard about such a measure.  We are pushing for that.  It would not cost a fortune to introduce.  We have priced it and included it in our alternative budget several times.  To introduce it now for the current level of transport would require an additional amount of approximately &euro;600 million in the budget.  Of course, transport must be more frequent, timely and accessible.  It must be democratised in consultation with local communities and responsive to their needs.  It should not only be a matter for what is in the heads of bureaucrats with good jobs in the NTA or Transport for Ireland.  There is a problem here and I hope the Minister acknowledges that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102500052#ZZ00200","speaker":"1486","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1666731600,"counter":408,"content":"<p>I welcome many aspects of this motion, in particular the call for privatised routes to be renationalised.  This should start immediately with the pathetic excuse for a service being inflicted on ordinary people by Go-Ahead Ireland.  I have been inundated with complaints from people who have been stranded as a result of the No. 175 bus not turning up.  Go-Ahead Ireland was recently fined &euro;500,000 by the NTA for failing to put on bus services at all - not because its services were late but because they did not turn up.  These are services paid for by the State and advertised to people who rely on them to get to work, school and hospital appointments.  The problem is that I doubt Go-Ahead is very bothered, given that its Irish subsidiary made &euro;2.6 million in profit last year.  Even after the fines, Go-Ahead Ireland is still raking it in at our expense.<\/p>  <p>  Why is this taking place at Go-Ahead Ireland?  I was talking to a worker only last night.  He told me that the fundamental issue is that the company is skimping on staff.  That is the logic of privatisation.  It is a race to the bottom.  The company is not investing properly in staff and, therefore, we are left with the problems we have.  That worker told me the situation is due to get even worse with the new rosters that are being introduced.  It will be even worse for the workers.  He told me that the workers are describing the new roster as the divorce roster because it means that many workers will not be home for three or four weekends in a row to spend time with their families.  Those rosters should be withdrawn.  Go-Ahead Ireland should be put out of business, its routes renationalised and all its workers transferred to Dublin Bus.<\/p>  <p>  We should not stop there.  We need a properly integrated, planned out public transport system and not a hodgepodge of disconnected privatised services that do not join up with each other.  We need massive State investment to extend public transport to the very many parts of the country that have no usable service.  Not just the western rail corridor and the Navan line but the whole country needs a vastly improved public transport system.<\/p>  <p>  I have a question as to why Sinn F&eacute;in did not call for free public transport in this motion.  Three weeks ago, Malta became the second EU country, after Luxembourg, to make public transport free.  Scotland brought in free bus travel for everyone under the age of 22 last January.  More than 100 cities around the world already offer some form of free public transport.  All the evidence shows that abolishing fares significantly increases public transport use, thereby reducing carbon emissions.  Ask the pensioners in Ireland who avail of the free travel scheme if they would still use public transport to the same extent if it was not free or if instead they would drive more.  We must get people out of cars and that means free, frequent, expanded and accessible public transport.  I hope our amendment will be supported.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102500053#AAA00200","speaker":"1628"},{"type":"speech","time":1666731600,"counter":409,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this important motion.  I welcome its introduction.  As the Minister knows, public transport is a rare species in the west of Ireland.  We know all about it.  I listened to some of Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith's comments about a 24-hour service and thought how happy people in parts of rural Ireland would be with a five-hour service.<\/p>  <p>  There are many things I could say about the rights and wrongs of public transport.  In my constituency, many people travel from the east and north of the county to work in the city.  Every day, approximately 40,000 cars pass through Claregalway, trying to get into the city.  As we know, the situation in respect of the city's outer ring road has now gone back in time.  We have spent more than &euro;32 million doing nothing other than creating paperwork.  We have to ask what in the name of God we are doing about transport in our own areas.<\/p>  <p>  I will give the Minister a small example.  Back in 2007, the then Minister for Transport, Noel Dempsey, opened a bus lane between Loughgeorge and Claregalway.  The plan was to build a bus lane from there into the city.  The bus lane did not require the acquisition of any land.  The space is there between the two walls and the road.  Everything is fine.  Lo and behold, we are almost into 2023 and we still do not have a word as to when this bus lane will be provided.  The NTA has not got on with the job in all those years.  Private bus operators are trying to get people into work but the buses are sitting in the same traffic as the cars.  There is no real incentive for commuters to get out of a car and into a bus if they are left sitting in the same traffic.  I do not know why that bus lane has not been provided.  We get reports, research, feasibility studies and everything, but we get nothing at the end of the day.<\/p>  <p>  There is much to be done for public transport in rural Ireland.  There is an enormous amount of work to be done with Local Link, creating services that connect to the bigger operators and connecting them in a timely way so the Local Link bus can meet the bus going into Galway, or wherever else, and so the buses going into towns will meet the trains.<\/p>  <p>  Speaking of trains, the Minister knows that we had a great conference in Tuam on Saturday at which we discussed investment in the west of Ireland.  The conference was organised by West-On-Track.  We have a campaign to reopen the line on the western rail corridor, under phases 2 and 3, to join Claremorris to Tuam and on to Athenry.  The intention is to create a corridor of rail infrastructure that will help us deliver our carbon targets in respect of rail freight and passengers.  We know that the line from Galway to Limerick is the fastest growing passenger line in Ireland.  At the conference on Saturday, people were talking about crowded trains with people sitting on the floors of carriages.  It is working, despite the fact that Irish Rail has not put on the proper schedules that were intended for phase 1 of the line.<\/p> <p> I welcome the fact that we are putting in a passing loop in Oranmore to create more opportunities to get trains in and out of the city.  Galway station is right in the heart of the city.  It is well located to be of help to the city but we seem to be dithering about it and I am not sure why.  If we are going to change the transport landscape from a political point of view, we have to start with the jobs we can do.  Phase 2 and 3 of the western rail corridor is a project that is shovel-ready.  It is ready to go.  I know that the Minister of State and many of his colleagues support it.  In fact, 110 Deputies and Senators in these Houses support the project so we will continue to work on it .  We need to ensure that we do not leave anything to chance and that we get these projects delivered.<\/p> <p> While I am talking about the rail service, I must note that there are bus services which are being cut out, for example between Gort and Limerick.  Bus services were taken out of Kilreekill and the bus stop was removed from there.  There are many mixed messages being delivered at the moment with public transport in Galway and further afield.  If we are going to make life easier for people who are travelling to work in Galway, we need to grasp this nettle.  We must ensure we provide a form of public transport which people can and will use, and provide the frequency it deserves and the people in the west of Ireland also deserve.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102500053#AAA00300","speaker":"1482","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1666732200,"counter":411,"content":"<p>Due to the lack of public transport options, the current system has been orientated towards car ownership and use.  Many workers and families, especially in rural Ireland, are completely reliant on private car use for education, work and leisure.  The transport sector accounts for 17.7% of our total greenhouse gas emissions.  Therefore, investment in public transport can play a central role in helping to reduce our carbon emissions.  While it must be acknowledged that the Government is now acting to reduce emissions and deliver environmental, social and economic benefits to all cities, towns and regions, it must also be said that we have not invested enough in public travel and active travel in the last decade.  I wish to raise a number of items specifically related to disability access, the lack of public transport in rural parts of Louth and east Meath, and the affordability and reliability of existing services.<\/p>  <p>  When the 2007-13 national development plan, Transforming Ireland - A Better Quality of Life For All, was launched, it provided for investment in infrastructure and social inclusion measures.  Its key objective was to tackle structural and infrastructural barriers which impact on regional development and the quality of life of the older and disabled population.  In 2021, this Government launched the renewed national development plan, which covers the 2021-30 period and places a particular focus on a cleaner, greener, connected Ireland.  Now there is no question of a lack of investment in this renewed plan, but it is imperative that the Minister for Transport monitors and periodically audits progress on improving accessibility for all.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to disability access, we need to consider the challenges faced daily by people with disabilities, the visually impaired, our senior citizens and those with mobility issues.  Some 13.5% of the population have a disability, so ensuring universal access for all on public transport must be a priority.  A constituent recently visited my office in Dundalk to complain that only one taxi is kitted out for wheelchair access in that town.  The same man faced barriers in accessing public transport to get to the airport, even after making contact prior to his journey to ensure there was an access ramp and sufficient wheelchair space.  This is unacceptable and is resulting in exclusion.  Are our disabled constituents to stay at home?  Transport solutions and mobility supports for those with a disability must be targeted immediately.<\/p>  <p>  I agree with the motion that the timeline for the delivery of the Connecting Ireland rural mobility plan must be accelerated.  Connectivity through rural connected hubs, as well as connecting rural communities through transport services, is crucial to keeping our rural communities alive.  While it must be acknowledged that the newly announced Pathfinder programme will provide critical links for cyclists commuting to work and schools in my constituency of Louth and Meath, it will only benefit those living in close proximity to work or college who can cycle or walk.     <\/p>  <p>  Because Louth is located along the commuter belt, I welcome the new regional connections between the midlands and north-east regions linking Dundalk and Ardee, Drogheda and Trim, and Athlone and Longford.  However, it must also be acknowledged that there is a lack of public transport infrastructure and public transport routes from rural parts of the constituency to larger areas, such as Dublin, with a high reliance on private commercial bus operators or cars.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to the affordability and reliability of services, while the commute for those using public transport is perhaps more affordable than before due to the Taxsaver ticket price reduction, commuters in Dundalk and Drogheda are heavily dependent on commercial bus operators to provide these necessary routes to work or college in Dublin.  The Government's failure to extend the 20% public transport fare reduction to commercial operators means that this initiative does not provide any relief to commuter costs amid this cost-of-living crisis.<\/p>  <p>  Spain has recently implemented measures offering free travel on state-owned suburban and regional public transport from 1 September to 31 December 2022, thanks to a windfall tax.  Germany introduced a nationwide ticket costing &euro;9 a month offering unlimited travel on most public transport, apart from express intercity trains.  Such initiatives will provide relief to commuter costs amid the cost-of-living crisis, while encouraging less car use and a reduction in fuel emissions.<\/p>  <p>  The solution to transport emissions, which relates to cities as well as transport between cities, is to change our system to encourage public transport and active travel.  It is not against motorists and does not say that we will not have or need additional roads, as we will need them, but that must be part of an overall plan that sees us meeting our emissions reduction targets.  We need to ensure rural and urban transport is completely frequent, flexible, reliable and accessible.  If we create that system, more and more people will use it and there will be less and less demand for people to have a car.<\/p>  <p>  I am one of the lucky people who invested in an electric car two years ago.  I have to be honest when I say it is by far the best car we have ever had.  The simple reason is that I have electric charging points in my home and when I have to go to work I can charge it.  I know many people who want to buy electric cars and cannot do so because of this.  Electric cars are expensive.  I know there are grants but it is a win-win for everybody if we can get the proper services for electric cars.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102500054#BBB00200","speaker":"1600"},{"type":"speech","time":1666732200,"counter":412,"content":"<p>We now move to the Rural Independent Group.

It is very important one because of people with disabilities and people who are unable to access transport.  When we talk about equal access and opportunities, we must bear in mind that these people are completely hindered.  I support the bones of the motion from that point of view.<\/p>  <p>  As a Deputy for rural Ireland, I want to say that we have no services.  Fares have been reduced since Covid for all of the urban services and for the few services we have in the country.  However, those who have no services cannot get a reduced rate.  It is as simple as that.  If services were not being provided by companies like Kavanaghs of Urlingford, Lamberts of Ardfinnan, McCarras and O'Donoghues of Clonmel, we would be in a bad way.  Another issue is that the town transport bus in Clonmel was taken away because of Covid and it has never come back.  It is like the snow up in the Nire; it went after the winter and we have not seen it since.<\/p>  <p>  There are many things to be made up and restored here, but having to book a train or a bus 24 hours in advance is an insult to the person in a wheelchair or whatever situation the person is in.  That is scandalous.<\/p>  <p>  I want to salute the voluntary boards up and down the country.  I was a member of the board of Ring a Link, which provided an excellent service in Kilkenny, Carlow and south Tipperary.  We were the motivators and initiators, as these boards were in many counties.  TII has now taken them over.  I know that the services are running well and we welcome them, but obviously we want more.  We have tried to run night links and different things, but they do not actually work.<\/p>  <p>  The Taoiseach is claiming today that people who cannot get a house can stay in a pub drinking all night.  They will have heat and light inside in the pub and will have a roof over their head.  Is opening pubs and bars in the middle of this deep recession all that the Cabinet has to discuss?  Thank God the Minister of State is not part of the Cabinet, and I do not mean that comment in a bad way.  I believe he would have been a voice of reason.  It seems that this nonsense is all the Cabinet has to discuss now.  I do not know who it is playing to.  Who wants to be inside a pub at 5 o&rsquo;clock or 6 o&rsquo;clock in the morning?  I heard a publican this morning saying that people could have two nights' enjoyment in one night.  Did one ever hear such talk when people cannot get a house, public transport or access to these services?  Of course it is different for Ukrainians or some other non-nationals.  When Irish people ask for more from the national budget, the answer is \"No\".  We have to go back to the end of the queue.  The Government has gone from the ridiculous to the sublime and back again to the ridiculous.  I think it is a shameful situation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102500054#BBB00500","speaker":"1612"},{"type":"speech","time":1666732800,"counter":415,"content":"<p>I thank Sinn F&eacute;in for this important motion but there are many parts of rural Kerry that do not have public transport at all.  If we are honest, there is not enough money in the Central Bank to service all of rural County Kerry with public transport because it is so expansive and places are so remote.  However, we want people to live there and we want to assist in whatever way we can.  There is certainly a problem with hackneys and taxis in rural towns and villages during the week and even at weekends because, if drivers are busy in the likes of Killarney or Kenmare, smaller places like Kilgarvan and other rural places have a problem getting public transport.  I honestly believe that taxis and hackneys should be subsidised during the day.  There are no taxis or hackneys working during the day in many parts of rural Kerry.  We appreciate the Local Link service, which does wonderful work, but it does not catch everyone.  In that regard, there should be some scheme to facilitate taxis and hackneys to help rural people do their shopping or other things they need to do to take the monotony out of their lives.  When the Government brought in the most recent drink-driving laws, which affected many rural people in many ways, it said that it would find a way to transport them to and from the local pub.  However, I am sad that the only place you would see a queue or crowd that has anything to do with drink is at a bottle bank because most drinking is now done at home.  You may not be sure of meeting many people in the pub but you will meet them around the bottle bank.  That is the effect of the Government's laws.

I am delighted to work with it to provide the bus for rural areas from stop to stop.  It also provides pick-up at the door for people who need it for different services.  A route was recently approved from Granagh to Limerick.  This will provide for second and third level students who cannot get accommodation around their institutions and who are staying at home and need transport.  The issue we are having is that it can often take three or four connections to get to the likes of Limerick Institute of Technology and the University of Limerick.

That will again feed into places like Bruree, Feenagh and Kilmeedy as people can get to the likes of O'Rourke's Cross and other areas that are approved for pick-up.

It is a matter of kicking the can down the road.  I keep pushing for that to happen and I hope it will happen along the Durrus line.  He is also talking about services from Skibbereen to Killarney but there is nothing there.  He has been in office for two and half years and has not delivered.

I drive down from Dublin especially to be at those meetings because, with the little money it has, the Local Link service delivers to as many people as it can.  It is a fantastic company, as are all Local Link companies.  Regardless of who funds them, they are not funded enough to deliver.  Why are people from Dunmanway to Clonakilty not being looked after?  Why is there no service there?  Why are we in west Cork treated as second-class citizens when the people of this country can get a fantastic service because of the carbon tax and whatever else?  We in rural Ireland pay for it but it is delivered everywhere else. <\/p>  <p>  In the little bit of time I have left, I will commend the people behind Cancer Connect.  It is a fabulous service set up under Local Link a number of years ago.  It is a voluntarily-delivered bus service but it needs funding from the State.  It is a fabulous service but it is being funded by the people of west Cork when it needs to be funded by the State as well.  It is a disgrace that has not happened.  Promises have been made and need to be delivered upon.<\/p>  <p>  If we are paying the most in carbon tax, we need a proper public transport service to be delivered.  It is only fair.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102500055#CCC00300","speaker":"1461"},{"type":"speech","time":1666732800,"counter":418,"content":"<p>I call on Deputy Connolly on behalf of the Independent Group.

I thank Sinn F&eacute;in for bringing forward the motion and giving us an opportunity to put the spotlight on public transport.  I welcome the amendment proposed by Solidarity-People Before Profit.  I hope Sinn F&eacute;in will consider it.  I will come back to the western rail corridor, which is given the thumbs-up in the motion, and that is welcome.  I did not see the motion in time to propose an amendment regarding light rail for Galway and a feasibility study in that regard.  I am sure Sinn F&eacute;in would have no difficulty with that but, unfortunately, I did not table it in time.<\/p><p>I will preface my remarks by quoting a Minister who said: &quot;We are losing biodiversity around the globe at a rate unprecedented in human history.&quot;  Those are not my words or those of somebody on the radical left but those of the Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, on 29 May 2019.  She also said:<\/p> <blockquote> \tWe are losing biodiversity around the globe at a rate unprecedented in human history.  The number of plants, insects, mammals and birds that are threatened or endangered grows every year, while the land, ocean and atmosphere are being altered to an unparalleled degree.  <\/blockquote>  <p>That is a Fine Gael Minister of State talking about what is happening with our world and biodiversity is just one aspect of it.  It seems that we have no choice but to embrace public transport as only one of the significant aspects of dealing with our obligations in respect of climate change.  I find the manner in which, here in the D&aacute;il, we regularly demonise people who take court cases disturbing.  I will refer to two court cases taken by Friends of the Irish Environment.  We have no choice.  Notwithstanding those wonderful words from the Minister of State or the Minister for Finance's earlier acknowledgement when I said the planet was burning - he nodded his head having said that himself in his budget speech last year - we are utterly dependent on these people.  What do we do if the planet is burning?<\/p> <p>We want to take what the children told us.  They embarrassed us into declaring a climate and biodiversity emergency.  I welcome that.  I welcome what the Government did there but really we were forced into it.  We repeatedly ignored all of the reports, going back to Rio de Janeiro.  We have persisted with development that is completely out of keeping with our obligations.<\/p> <p> Deputy O'Connor had some words about the recent decision on the outer bypass with which I do not agree.  I was elected in 1999.  Since 1999, I and a number of other voices, including the now President of Ireland, were part of a group called Hands across the Corrib.  It was not NIMBYism or anything like that but because the bypass was wrong.  This outer bypass is wrong.  We knew it was wrong but even worse was the fact that it was the only egg in the basket, as it were.  It was the only thing the city and county councils pursued and it precluded any other solution.  Since 1999, I have continuously lost votes on this issue.  I am not going to change.  I fundamentally believe that that road and the N6 are wrong.  It is completely out of keeping with the type of development we need.  Both routes have now gone down a cul-de-sac.  We choose to demonise as opposed to grasping the opportunity that has been given to us now.  The decision by An Bord Plean&aacute;la to agree with Friends of the Irish Environment that the board's decision should be quashed is a wonderful opportunity.  That is what it agreed.  We should embrace that and the Government should take a hands-on approach to what is needed in Galway city.<\/p> <p> The Minister of State has been in Galway many times and been subjected to traffic congestion.  We have no park-and-ride services, as he well knows.  I am repeating myself at the risk of boring people.  In 2005, when I was mayor, the council and I led in putting in park-and-ride objectives.  That has remained in the city development plan and never been rolled out.  The NTA is now telling us that it is looking at it.  Imagine that.  Some 17 years later it is going to look at park-and-ride services on the east side of the city.  Quite incredibly, it is telling us that they are not needed on the west side of the city.  That is what it told us.  It is not looking at any site on the west side of the city, notwithstanding the traffic coming in from Connemara.  Somebody who works in my office has to come in in that traffic.<\/p> <p> There was the decision from An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  I made a submission so we all got copies.  There were three sets of precedents but I am focusing on the Friends of the Irish Environment.  The letter from the solicitor tells us, \"The board held five meetings to consider the application before making its decision at its fifth and final meeting on November 8th, 2021\".  Quite incredibly, the board granted planning permission even though it was not aware that the new climate action plan had been adopted four days previously.  It went on to say it had not been informed.  One wonders what world the board members are living in.  The Government itself promoted the climate action plan way back in March of that year.  It set out clearly what it intended to do in the climate action plan, which An Bord Plean&aacute;la was simply unaware of.  It is quite incredible.  Add to that the response of the two local authorities, which once again put their heads in the sand and said they were disappointed that the decision to quash the consent for the N6 project was done on narrow grounds.  Can the Minister of State imagine that?  They say it was done on a very limited ground, that is, their utter failure to consider the climate action plan.  I am going around in a circle to come back and say our words mean nothing.<\/p> <p> An Bord Plean&aacute;la and the two local authorities are now interpreting that decision, saying it was narrow grounds when they utterly failed to consider the climate action plan.  Prior to that, An Bord Plean&aacute;la must have been completely asleep because back in 2020 the Friends of the Irish Environment brought a case to the Supreme Court and the Supreme Court held that the national mitigation plan for climate change was too vague.  It quashed that plan.  That is what led to us having a new plan.  It said citizens were entitled to know what was in a plan and what the Government intended.  It seems An Bord Plean&aacute;la was not aware of that either and was not aware of any of the reports that showed the substantial emissions from transport.  Perhaps there might be a different way with a combination of solutions.  When the decision was made in March, there was a major press release from the Government regarding the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Act 2021.<\/p> <p> I fully support the amendment relating to free transport.  Perhaps it is not feasible to introduce it in January 2023 but we have no choice but to go down that road.  We should look at the countries that have already been mentioned.  Luxembourg became the first country to introduce it on 29 February 2020 and on 1 October this year Malta became the second country to make public transport free for all residents.  Germany was overwhelmed when it introduced a fare of &euro;9 a month, such was the demand for it.  I welcome the changes that have been made by the Government through public transport fare reductions.  In fact, I am back on the bus myself.  I was always on a bus but I went to a car when I got the extra job and am now back on a bus again.  People want to use public transport.  People in Galway want to use public transport.  I certainly do not want to punish the motorist in Galway who has no option because we have failed to bring in park-and-ride facilities.  We have failed to lift the school transport of the city.  We have failed to listen to the people of Galway.  Around 25,000 people signed a petition so long ago I cannot remember.  We stood in the rain asking the Government to please carry out a feasibility study.  We still have no study.  We have a thriving city, a beautiful city that is positioned between the beautiful Corrib and the Atlantic Ocean and Galway Bay.  Within that, we need to lift the traffic off the road.<\/p> <p> There was duplicity about the western rail corridor.  Hypocrisy has gone on while the north west has been demoted yet again, for the second time, by the European Commission.  I did not have the chance to go to that wonderful conference on Saturday.  The Minister of State was there.  I have read all the blurbs relating to it and so I know they laid out exactly what was possible and the vision for it.  I fully endorse that.  If we are seriously interested in regional balance and if we are seriously interested in tackling climate change and biodiversity, we need a transformative vision and transformative action.  It is too late for any other type of piecemeal approach.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102500055#CCC00500","speaker":"1577","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1666733400,"counter":421,"content":"<p>On behalf of the Minister for Transport and the Minister of State, Deputy Naughton, I thank all the Deputies for their contributions to this debate on accessible, affordable and reliable public transport.  In both the motion itself and the contributions I have heard from individual Deputies during the debate, we can see the range of challenges and opportunities but also the progress that has been made to date.  I believe we are all in agreement about wanting to provide a comprehensive public transport network that serves the needs of all members of society in both urban and rural areas and one which addresses, as a number of Deputies have spoken to, our climate challenge.<\/p>  <p>  As the House is aware, the Government is strongly committed to providing all citizens with reliable and realistic sustainable mobility options, and public transport plays a key role in the delivery of this goal.  The recently agreed budget 2023 helps support this objective and is a further positive development for public transport passengers across the country.  We have extended the 20% fare reduction on PSO services until the end of 2023 so that everyone will benefit.  Equally, we have extended the 50% reduction available for young adults on both PSO and commercial services until the end of 2023.  We are supporting new and enhanced bus and rail services throughout 2023 as well.  These are all part of a &euro;563 million funding package to support PSO services.  That package was hugely significant in the context of providing accessible and affordable transport options.  With regard to PSO contracts, I reiterate that any issues relating to punctuality, reliability and customer service standards are dealt with as part of the contractual arrangements between the NTA and the operators.<\/p> <p>Furthermore, any issues of poor reliability or punctuality performance could result in financial penalties for those operators, and this has been acknowledged this evening.  In incidences where operators have not met the minimum standards in recent months, the National Transport Authority, NTA, has applied significant penalties to those operators, and has engaged extensively with the operators with a view to improving service reliability.<br\/><br\/>With regard to transport provision in rural Ireland, the Connecting Ireland rural mobility plan is a key component of the Government's ambitious plans in this area and will significantly increase the number of routes and the frequency of existing services right across the country.  Connecting Ireland proposes to specifically to expand the public transport network in rural areas, and to increase service levels.  For instance, under Connecting Ireland the NTA proposes an overall increase of approximately 25% in rural bus services as part of the five-year Connecting Ireland plan.  Hundreds of rural villages and areas will, for the first time, be served by viable public transport link.  Service improvements are already being rolled out under Connecting Ireland, with more planned before the end of the year.  I endorse all of the remarks about Local Link this evening around its success and its efficacy on the ground.  For the benefit of those Deputies who do not realise it, I must point out that Local Link is funded by this Government.<br\/><br\/>At present, routes that are identified through the Connecting Ireland consultation process are being prioritised to provide emergency public transport services to areas where the population and transport demand has increased due to the requirement to house Ukrainian refugees in rural locations.  This is being achieved by accelerating network improvements, including additional stocks, route modifications, and more services to increase connectivity.<br\/><br\/>The Government also has ambitious plans for public transport infrastructure nationwide.  The programme for Government commits to a fundamental change in the nature of transport in Ireland.  This is supported by the national development plan, which has allocated &euro;35 billion to maintain, enhance and improve transport infrastructure across the country over the next ten years.  The substantial investment in transport in recent years, and the planned ramping up of major projects such as BusConnects in every city, Connecting Ireland in rural areas, the Cork area commuter rail programme, the DART+ project and MetroLink means that the national public transport landscape will continue to transform for the better in the coming years.<br\/><br\/>Under Project Ireland 2040, spatial planning and capital investment are being linked together in a meaningful way, while significant levels of investment are being put forward towards new public and sustainable transport initiatives, as well as major new road projects.  Further capacity on the Kildare-Maynooth and northern rail lines will be increased by more than 30% compared to today, and the new rail cars required to achieve this increase have already started to arrive on the island and will enter service next year.<br\/><br\/>The third phase of BusConnects was rolled out in May this year and introduced two new northern orbital routes: the N4 connecting Blanchardstown to the Point Village; and the N6 connecting Finglas with Howth Junction.  Most recently, phase 4 of BusConnects commenced on 16 October, with the introduction of G spine routes G1, G2, and route 60 operated by Dublin Bus.  The routes will serve areas such as Ballyfermot, Liffey Valley, Clondalkin and Islandbridge.  I have listened to Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith's<b><\/b>complaints about the lack of local connection to these G routes and I will follow this up.<br\/><br\/>To help us achieve our climate targets, it was decided that from 2019 no new diesel buses would be purchased for urban public service obligation bus fleets.  Deputies will be aware that as part of BusConnects the current fleet of buses in Dublin will be increased and converted to a zero-emission fleet by 2035, meeting rising demand and saving the equivalent of nearly 85,000 tonnes of CO<sub>2<\/sub>per year, in line with our climate action plan targets.  Buses and shelters will be modernised, increasing accessibility, and ensuring safe and enjoyable trips for passengers.  Public transport investment, including bus and rail, can play a major role in decreasing CO<sub>2<\/sub>emissions from the transportation sector, and provide workers, families and communities with an alternative and sustainable mode of transport.<br\/><br\/>I reiterate that the Minister for Transport is fully committed to strengthening our public transport offerings and progressively making them accessible for all.  This requires a whole-journey approach, which refers to all elements that constitute a journey, from the starting point to the destination.  It also means applying the principle of universal design.  In addition, the sustainable mobility policy and some of the other key guiding policies include the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, the national disability inclusion strategy, and the comprehensive employment strategy for people with disabilities.  The public transport accessibility actions across these and other national strategies have been combined into the Department of Transport's accessibility work programme, which provides a fright framework for prioritising projects and programmes to progressively make public transport accessible.  The Department of Transport will continue to engage with all stakeholders, particularly people who are disabled, to continue to work and make public transport more accessible for all.<br\/><br\/>As outlined earlier, the strategic rail review will examine the role of rail in supporting relevant policy objectives on the entire island of Ireland.  We need this type of strategic analysis to inform our consideration of specific projects, and in this regard the House will be pleased to know that the review will consider the potential scope for improved rail services along various existing and potential future corridors of the network.  That scope will also include the potential afforded by disused and closed lines such as the western rail corridor.  I acknowledge Deputy Canney's work on the <i>ad hoc <\/i>all-party group in relation to the western rail corridor in advance of all the all-Ireland rail review.  The review will be one of the most significant reviews of the rail network on the island in many years.  It will provide a framework to develop a much improved all-island rail network in the years ahead.  The Department of Transport expects the review to be completed by the end of this year.<br\/><br\/>In conclusion, I assure the House that the Minister fully recognises and emphasises the hugely important role that public transport plays in all of our lives and is acutely aware of the concerns that have been raised in relation to making public transport fully accessible, reliable, and affordable to all.  The ambitious investment programmes in the public transport sector over the coming years, such as BusConnects and Connecting Ireland, will go a long way towards achieving these goals by helping to improve people's quality of life and helping to grow the economy in both urban and rural areas through the provision of improved transport links.  I believe that with the work that has been done in recent years and with these plans, which all contributors here today have agreed are essential to achieving a comprehensive public transport system that we wish to provide, we will achieve the goal to build a more efficient framework for the provision of public transport in Ireland.<br\/><br\/>Deputy James O'Connor has asked me to clarify his remarks on the planning process, which were referred to by Deputy Catherine Connolly.  Deputy O'Connor had referred to the White Paper response on page 2 and his concerns about the delivery of major transport projects.  Indeed, the planning framework around major infrastructural projects is also the subject of a review, which will conclude in the coming weeks.<br\/><br\/>I thank all Members for their inputs this evening and I look forward to pursuing the issues that have been raised.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102500056#DDD00200","speaker":"1602","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1666734000,"counter":423,"content":"<p>Having listened to some of the Government representatives tonight I believe they either come from very different places than I do or they are not being forthright in the context of the reality of many people.  I come from a county that has no real transport network whatsoever.  It has a bus service that has actually deteriorated since this Government came into office.  It is astounding that not only did the Minister for Transport, Deputy Eamon Ryan, not participate in this debate, not a single member of the Green Party decided to grace us with their presence tonight.<\/p>  <p>  Under the current framework of this Government the only things that the people in County Monaghan see in the lived reality are increased charges through carbon taxes, which are essentially penalties, for not using services that do not exist.  People must pay more to this Government to get to work in their cars because there is no option but to use their cars.  They must pay more to this Government to go to college because they cannot find accommodation in the places where they go to college.  Increasingly this year they must pay more to this Government to drive with their children every morning behind the school bus to the local school and collect them every afternoon because the Government made such a hames of the school transport system for many families this year.  This is simply not fair.<\/p> <p>It is simply not fair to always spout rhetoric about just transition, public transport and moving away from the car, and then penalise people for using their cars when the Government refuses to put alternatives in place.  That needs to be called out and this motion calls it out.  I commend Deputy O'Rourke on tabling it.  If the Government is serious about moving away from fuel-powered engines, it needs to put in place the infrastructure, not through petty removal of funding for roads like the Clontibret to the Border road scheme, as the Minister did this year, without a whimper from his Government colleagues in Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael, but by providing investment to ensure people can get buses to places other than O'Connell Street.  At the minute, you cannot get a bus to anywhere else from my county.  We must put in place a blueprint that will deliver a rail network and allow us to have a sustainable route to living, working and rearing our families.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102500057#EEE00200","speaker":"1451","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1666734600,"counter":425,"content":"<p>In Limerick, I drive a car, cycle my bike, walk to work and take local buses where I can, and I mostly take a train when I come to Dublin.  The train to Dublin, which I have been taking for seven years, is almost always on time.  Unfortunately, the buses in Limerick are a different story.  Public transport needs to be safe, reliable and affordable.  If it cannot meet these three crucial criteria, people will not leave their cars at home and avail of public transport.  It is as simple as that.  Without a significant decrease in the number of private car journeys, we will struggle to meet the 2030 emission targets.  In our alternative budget, we proposed an &euro;195 million investment in public transport, cutting fares, investing in a new rail infrastructure and making public transport safer and more accessible.  Our progressive proposal shows we can cut emissions while delivering social and economic benefits for citizens.<\/p><p>I thank the thousands of public service workers who work in our buses and trains, providing a vital service every day of the week.<\/p><p>Prior to speaking today, I asked in my constituency for feedback on public transport in Limerick.

The Minister of State, Deputy Naughton, stated that some elements of the motion \"do not properly reflect the progress to date in this area, the work currently under way or the Government's future plans for public transport.\"  I do not know what that means.  We have set out, for example, in the area of Connecting Ireland, the rural bus plan which is supported by the Opposition, that the Government is not investing enough in it and not rolling it out at a suitable pace.  The Minister of State also said implementation of the programme would continue at the pace outlined by the Government and in line with the funding and operational resources available.  The reason we tabled the motion is that we are not satisfied adequate progress has been made on Connecting Ireland.  We have spelled out what we believe the Government should do, which is to increase the investment in it.<\/p>  <p>  I can give examples from my county.  Some months ago, the Minister of State, Deputy Naughton, informed the House that Kentstown would have a service this year, after 40 years without one.  It will not have it this year because the commitment is not being delivered on.  The same applies elsewhere.  Invest in the Navan rail line now, not post 2031 as the Government reaffirmed tonight.  The same goes for the dedicated public transport policing unit.  It has to happen in order for workers and passengers to feel safe to use public transport.  Services must be expanded, costs and fares driven down and the people working on and using our public transport system protected.<\/p>  <p>  We also need accountability.  The Minister of State, Deputy Naughton, made the point, which the Minister of State, Deputy Calleary, echoed that the NTA engages in contracts with providers and it is a matter for them.  The Minister for Transport is responsible for the delivery of the public transport network.  I have sat in Opposition for at least four hours of debate on public transport in the last couple of weeks and the Minister has not been here for one minute of it.  I and others have discussed with the Minister of State and others Go-Ahead Ireland and the lack of accountability for its service, and the senior Minister has not been here for any of that discussion.  We want to see accountability for the provision of public transport services.  There is significant room for improvement there.<\/p>  <p>  We are lucky with the huge effort and work that workers in the public transport service provide and deliver.  They need to be supported and resourced.

As Minister of State with special responsibility for farm safety, I have always considered farmers' mental health and wellbeing to be inextricably linked to farm safety.  We know that a farmer is seven times more likely to lose his or her life in a workplace incident on his or her farm than in any other profession in the country, making it by far the most dangerous workplace in the country.<\/p>  <p>  In that context, the results of the recent University College Dublin, UCD-HSE study are particularly stark when we look at their research project into farmers and developing a suicide prevention intervention for farmers in Ireland.  That study found that between 2014 and 2019, in five of those six years, more farmers died by suicide than they did in farm safety incidents.  That puts in context exactly the challenge with which we are dealing.  The extent of the challenge we face in the area of supporting farmers whose mental health is suffering is really clear.  Anecdotally, it is very much the case, having dealt with a number of different groups and organisations and with farmers, that the challenge has been in identifying where farmers are struggling and signposting the supports to them.  It is not that the supports are not there.  We have to do better in identifying where farmers are struggling, however, and identify where they pull back from society and are not having that social interaction or where they maybe feel things are getting on top of them.  We are taking a number of measures in my Department and working with colleagues and other Departments as well.<\/p>  <p>  Government has placed a huge priority on farmer mental health and farm safety.

Much bureaucracy and red tape is coming at farmers with many forms to be filled out and so on.  If they get it wrong, then they do not get payments.

Last year, as he is probably aware, I commissioned a KPMG report to identify the challenges and opportunities for the horticulture sector.  The report referred to by the Deputy in his question, \"Opportunities for the Irish horticulture sector\", was published in July this year.  The report identifies the sector's dependence on peat as a threat in the SWOT analysis and the research challenge to finding alternative growing media.  The report also proposes actions to address this and other cross-cutting challenges to the sector.<\/p>  <p>  Additional actions were taken to address peat supply in horticulture, arising from a working paper published on 20 January 2022 by my Department in conjunction with the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications and the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  This working paper outlines a series of actions to support horticultural growers who are dependent on peat as a growing medium.  The aim of these actions was to address the short-term issue of supply, the medium-term issue of future access to peat and also the longer-term issue of replacement with alternatives for all sectors within horticulture, including mushrooms.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of short-term action for my Department on peat supply, Mr. S&eacute;amus Boland was commissioned to carry out a report on peat supply.  A final version of his report has just recently been received by my Department and is due for publication shortly.  On medium-term action relating to access to peat, Mr. Des Johnson and Mr. Padraig Thornton were commissioned to carry out a report on the planning requirements for peat extraction on sub-30 ha bogs.  A final report of this work has also been received by my Department and will also be published shortly.  The longer-term action for my Department requires research into alternatives to peat.  Some &euro;1.69 million was awarded by my Department for a research project, Beyond Peat.  The project is co-ordinated by Teagasc, with project partners across Ireland.  The project aims to identify full and partial replacements for peat within professional horticulture.  The project is progressing well and to schedule.  Separately, research projects on peat alternatives continue to be approved by my Department under the EU producer organisation scheme for fruit and vegetables.

That is most welcome, because with the green low-carbon agri-environment scheme, GLAS, in some cases there was something planted, then removed, then replanted for the next round of GLAS.  I know that we are moving to a more long-term view of results-based schemes.  That is welcome.

Both the programme for Government and Food Vision 2030 acknowledge and underline the importance of our food producers, particularly our farmers and small food producers, and their importance in maintaining vibrant rural and coastal communities.  Support is available to local small food producers and businesses in a variety of ways.  Bord Bia has recently commissioned research, which examined, among other things, how other countries have been successful in developing premium markets for family farm produce from small producers. One of the issues outlined in that report was the barriers faced by producers.  While there are lots of supports available to our smaller food producers, access to them and information on how to access them was found to be a barrier.  Food producers were not aware that supports are available.  In terms of supports provided, my Department administers the rural innovation and development fund, which includes an agrifood tourism initiative.  For initiatives such as the development of farm shops, niche products and ecotourism, and for market development, competitiveness and innovation, support continues to be made available through the LEADER food initiative, which is funded by my Department through CAP and operated by the Department of Rural and Community Development.  The new CAP strategic plan will provide supports to farmers and rural communities.  The LEADER programme is a key element of that.

It is so short-sighted.  Crucially, in terms of food security, greater diversity creates greater resilience.  There are additional benefits that the Minister of State touched on in her response, including the fact that it helps create produce that can be marketed and used to attract tourism. I think west Cork is a really good example of what can be done there.  However, this type of approach is at serious risk without any supports.  Rather than just paying lip service to it, we need to really look at a return to practical local processing facilities, such as small abattoirs.  As the Minister of State said, we need to look to other countries.

A series of court cases has been taken in the past year or so.  These found that the approach being taken to the assessment of needs model that was in place was inconsistent with the Disabilities Act.  Children were not getting adequate assessment of their needs.  In many instances, children were only being seen briefly under what was called the standard operating procedure.  That was struck down.<\/p>  <p>  Approximately five days ago, schools received a note from the Department of Education outlining the report of educational needs for the purpose of the assessment of need under the Disabilities Act 2005.  To say that has alarmed and worried school staff, teachers and principals is an understatement.<\/p> <p>They believe, and are quite entitled to believe on reading this document the Department has circulated, that the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, is passing the buck and is effectively asking schools, teachers and principals, to be the very first step in the assessment of need, AON, process and to be the people who are effectively involved in drafting a document which could form part of a legal document under the Disability Act, which is the assessment of need.  This is grossly unfair on school staff, on parents and, of course, on children that schools are now essentially being charged with the initial screening or beginning of the assessment of need process.  School staff are not qualified, by their own admission, to do an assessment of children with additional educational needs and it seems this is not in line with the Disability Act.  It is certainly not in line with what Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs, EPSEN, Act envisioned is in the best interests of children.  Legal experts and many people involved in the special education area believe that the legal basis for this is questionable.<\/p> <p> On top of that, this is simply not a sustainable approach.  The courts decided that the NCSE had a role to play in this and that it would be responsible for ensuring that the educational needs were incorporated into the assessment of need.  At no stage in that court case was it said that the NCSE should decide that the schools should do that, because those in schools are not educational psychologists.  The schools have many very capable people who have a great deal of talents, with special education teachers and so forth, but the schools themselves would be the first to say they are not trained to assess the educational needs of children for the purpose of an assessment of need, which is a legal document which has considerable status in the Disability Act.<\/p> <p> This is an ill-thought-out approach and will lead to schools, principals and teachers being caught between a rock and a hard place.  It could potentially lead to children not getting an appropriate or adequate assessment of need, or being passed over entirely, with all of the implications that that has for admissions to special classes at post-primary level and to special schools, for their therapies or for any supports they need through the system as a whole.  This is a very badly thought-out approach and I urge the Department to reconsider it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102500067#PPP02600","speaker":"1460","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1666740600,"counter":571,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising this issue.  I am replying to this Topical Issue debate on behalf of the Minister of State with responsibility for special education and inclusion who could not be here this evening.  It provides an opportunity to outline the current position regarding the recent changes to the assessment of need process and on the roles and responsibilities of the National Council for Special Education and schools.  The AON process is provided for under the Disability Act 2005.  Assessment officers under the remit of the HSE are charged with organising the assessment of need.  The assessment officer makes the determination as to whether or not a child or young person meets the definition of disability contained in the Act.  The assessment officer co-ordinates and completes the assessment report.<\/p>  <p>  As referred to by Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire, since a court ruling in October 2021, there is now a legal obligation on the education system to assist the HSE as part of the HSE's assessment of need process.<\/p>  <p>  The Department of Education and NCSE have worked intensively to ensure the process put in place adheres to legal obligations arising from the HSE's AON process, and is one that is rooted in existing good practice in schools.  Under the Disability Act 2005, the NCSE is obliged to nominate a person with appropriate expertise to assist in the education assessment process.  Where the child is enrolled in a school the Education of Persons with Special Education Needs Act 2004 names the principal as the person the NCSE should contact.  Identification of education needs is central to the way schools provide for the inclusion and participation of all students and to providing an education which is appropriate to a student's abilities and needs.<\/p>  <p>  In that regard, it is important to note that schools routinely identify students' needs.  This aligns with the obligations on schools arising from the Education Act 1998.  They use a range of assessment practices as part of the continuum of support process.  This is a problem-solving model of assessment and intervention that enables schools to gather and analyse data about each individual pupil's education needs, as well as for planning and review of the progress of individual pupils.  The continuum of support framework enables the school to identify, address and review progress in meeting the academic, social and emotional needs of the pupil, as well as the physical, sensory, language and communication needs.<\/p>  <p>  Schools have been provided with a range of resources to ensure that the education needs of all students, including those with a disability or other additional education needs, are identified and supported.  The Department of Education issued guidelines for primary and post-primary schools on how they should identify and provide for the special education and learning needs of students in 2017.<\/p>  <p>  Information derived from the school's assessments in education are recorded in a student support file.  In line with best educational practice, the student support file details a student's education needs, as identified by the school.  The information contained in the student support file is used in completing the educational component of the assessment of need form which is returned to the HSE via the NCSE.<\/p>  <p>  The Department of Education and the NCSE are conscious of the workload on schools and on school leaders and, in that regard, an extensive consultation process on the educational component of the assessment of need process was undertaken prior to its introduction.  This process involved schools, advocacy groups, management bodies and unions.  The Department of Education and the NCSE worked with a small number of schools on a draft of the documents required as part of the HSE's assessment of need process.

On the one hand, where a school believes a child might need additional support or may have an additional need, it will talk to the HSE and the NCSE about how that child can be supported.  Schools have a role undoubtedly in that and principals and teachers are well-placed to identify somebody who potentially may need additional support.<\/p>  <p>  It is an entirely different thing but it is completely back-to-front for the NCSE to put the responsibility for filtering that onto the school.  It is one thing to say that a child may need additional support but it is another thing entirely for the NCSE to be expecting the first part of this process in the assessment of educational needs to start with the school.  It changes the relationship quite substantially.  A school support plan is a working document which outlines a plan to ensure the child can progress.  This changes the nature of that document completely because it can now potentially form part of a legal document under the Disability Act.  If the school support plan is now being equated with part of an assessment of need, then what one has been doing with the school support plan, which is a live working document and an instrument of education, changes completely.  I want to emphasise that this is putting teachers between a rock and a hard place because parents will be impressing on them the fact that there are needs.  The teachers may not agree but the teachers are not educational psychologists.  They may miss a child, or they may miss the needs of a child.<\/p>  <p>  This is not terribly complicated when one boils it all down and when one looks at the documents.

Since 2017 and the introduction of the special education teacher model, the identification of educational needs has been central to the way schools provide for the inclusion and participation of all students.  This marked a significant shift from a diagnostic-driven system of allocating support to a front-loaded, responsive and needs-led model.  Schools are required to use their available resources to ensure that the education needs of all students, including those with a disability or other additional educational needs, are identified and provided for.  It is, therefore, proposed that this approach to identifying education need in schools, an approach which is comprehensive, robust, evidence-informed and appropriate to the education sector at this time, is also appropriate for the purpose of identifying education needs under the Disability Act.  I am assured that the Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, is satisfied that the educational component of the assessment of need process is child-centred, in line with educational good practice and ensures that schools, who hold all of the relevant information on the child, are supported in providing this detail to the HSE.  I assure the Deputy that the Department of Education and the NCSE will continue to provide support to schools as needed.  I will certainly reflect Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire's concern to the Minister of State and ask that guidance be given in that regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102500068#QQQ00400","speaker":"1602","continuing":true},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Freedom of Speech","time":1666741200,"counter":575,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102500069#RRR00150"},{"type":"speech","time":1666741200,"counter":576,"content":"<p>As the Minister of State will appreciate, one of the strongest elements of our democracy is the energy and commitment of our community and activist groups.  These are ordinary citizens who band together to enter into debate, to bring attention to injustice and to lift up their voices.  I have had positive experiences with these groups and these people, even when we disagree.  That is why I am so disheartened to see a shadow cast over this community over the past few weeks.<\/p>  <p>  As the Minister of State will no doubt be aware, there has been a lot of public discourse on defamation.  I welcome the Government's commitment to legislate against strategic lawsuits against public participation, SLAPPs in the coming months.  These are meritless or vexatious lawsuits taken by powerful individuals or organisations against weaker parties who express an opinion or convey information on a public matter that is perceived as unfavourable or uncomfortable to the powerful.  However, I have been made aware of a further unseen layer of this activity that would not, and could not, be impacted by the proposed legislation.  While SLAPP legislation will address initiated legal action, often on defamation, as far as I understand it, it will not cover actions prior to that initiation and their interaction with non-disclosure agreements, NDAs.  What I am describing is a process whereby a person or entity instructs a legal representative to write a letter threatening legal action, sometimes demanding an apology, usually demanding some financial restitution and, increasingly and more worryingly, demanding the signing of an NDA, all without any court being troubled at any time.  The Coalition against SLAPPs in Europe is tracking cases like this and would welcome hearing from anyone impacted by them, as would I.  <\/p>  <p>  To provide an example, a columnist in one of our national newspapers, Mr. David Quinn, has threatened legal action against a member of a group advocating for safe access zones for women accessing abortions.  He has asked not only for money and an apology, but also the signing of an NDA.  Mr. Quinn has targeted this group in his columns before and his opinions cannot reasonably be disentangled from those of his employer, the Iona Institute.  This is relevant because we know that foreign money is flooding into Ireland and other European countries to stoke discord.  In 2021, the European Parliamentary Forum for Sexual and Reproductive Rights published a report called The Tip of the Iceberg.  That report outlined the Iona Institute's interaction with funds from Fondazione Novae Terrae.  This foundation bankrolls activity against what it describes as new or secular rights such as reproductive rights, marriage equality and trans rights.  The possible involvement of the Iona Institute here is relevant because its 2020 financial statements showed that it did not incur legal expenses.  If its director enjoys the same luxury, a great many activists and groups in Ireland could have received similar letters from Mr. Quinn but, of course, neither we nor the Government will ever know that because the NDAs are in place and the matters in question will never get to court.  I ask that any review of the Defamation Act 2009, any SLAPP legislation and any legislation at all in this area would examine what additional protections can be put in place for activists and groups in the pre-court phase of this type of activity.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102500069#RRR00200","speaker":"1559"},{"type":"speech","time":1666741200,"counter":577,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.  I convey the apologies of my colleague, the Minster for Justice, Deputy McEntee, who regrets she cannot be here for this matter owing to another commitment.  She recognises that SLAPP proceedings are a significant potential threat to freedom of expression and to public participation, both in Ireland and internationally, particularly in respect of investigative journalism on matters of public interest.  The programme for Government commits to a review of Ireland's defamation laws, as do the Department of Justice's Statement of Strategy 2021-2023 and the Minister's justice plan.  The Department has carried out a review of the Defamation Act 2009, the report on which was published in March.<\/p>  <p>  On 27 April 2022, the European Commission published a proposal for a directive that aims to provide common procedural safeguards at EU level against SLAPPs.  Ireland opted into the adoption and application of the proposed anti-SLAPP directive, in accordance with Protocol 21 of the Treaty on European Union-Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, in early July 2022.  The proposed directive is now under consideration by a working party of the European Council and the Minister's officials are contributing to that discussion.  The objectives of the Commission's proposed anti-SLAPP directive are compatible with those of our proposed reforms to defamation law.<\/p>  <p>  The Department's defamation report includes a recommendation to \"introduce a new 'anti-SLAPP' mechanism, to allow a person to apply to court for summary dismissal of proceedings that he\/she believes are a SLAPP\".  A defamation (amendment) Bill to advance reforms following the review is included in the Government's autumn legislation programme.  The Department is working on the general scheme of the amending Bill.  The Minister hopes that the drafting of the general scheme will be completed as soon as possible.  It is intended that we will take full account of the development of the anti-SLAPPs directive during its reading before the European Council.  The Minister will also be taking full account of the new EU Digital Services Act as it pertains to online defamation.<\/p>  <p>  Ensuring that journalism can flourish and that journalists can carry out their work safely and free from harassment is a responsibility shared by all democratic governments.  Earlier this year, a new journalist safety group was set up comprising representatives of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and representatives of the media and the National Union of Journalists.  The group will allow journalists and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to work in collaboration to make sure journalists are free from threats and violence.  A Garda liaison officer has been appointed and steps taken to facilitate the reporting and addressing of individual complaints of harassment and abuse of journalists.  In light of the importance of these matters, the Minister intends that a representative of the Department will join the group.  The forum will allow regular discussion on how best to address matters of journalist safety including the increasing phenomena of online harassment and the making of online threats.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102500069#RRR00300","speaker":"1602"},{"type":"speech","time":1666741200,"counter":578,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State.

Any assault causing harm on any person is an offence under section 3 of the same Act.<\/p> <p>A person convicted of such an offence would be liable on summary conviction to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months or to a maximum fine of &euro;2,500 or both.

Coco's Law strengthens the Government's response to harm perpetrated online as well as offline and ensures that individuals who commit crimes in contravention of this legislation can be brought to justice.  This important Act not only created new offences relating to intimate image abuse, it also broadened the scope of the existing offence of harassment and increased the maximum penalty applicable.  It provides for an offence of sending, distributing or publishing a threatening or grossly offensive message to or about another person with intent to cause harm.  It also broadened the scope of the current offence of harassment under the Non-Fatal Offences against the Person Act, which previously referred to communication to a person.  It now includes persistent communication about a person, sometimes referred to as indirect harassment.

It is raining cats and dogs and we had huge rainfall Sunday night of last week in many parts of the country, including in south Tipperary.  Thurles town was badly affected as were Cahir, Cashel and Tipperary town.  It was unprecedented rainfall.  I must mention the lack of maintenance of our roads with the cuts to personnel.  I have to single out Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, and the National Roads Association, NRA, before it.  They developed fine motorways through Tipperary.  We see TII regularly doing maintenance with road markings and hedge cutting.  I am told by adjoining landowners it does not do any maintenance on the drainage.  I am speaking about the drainage that is sometimes cut out or sometimes a road is high.  The roads were cut through land and through rivers and streams.  I pointed out at the time that in many cases a number of small culverts were put in place rather than one eye of a bridge.  They are all getting blocked with debris from forestry and everything else.  It is natural debris.  There is damage being done to people's homes and properties.  I know of part of a farm that was washed away by a torrent coming down from the Galtee Mountains in the parish of Ballylooby.  We must have respect for land owners and property owners.<\/p>  <p>  The cost of projects this year has gone spiralling upwards in the council.  Its maintenance budget is exhausted much earlier than in any other year because of the increased cost.  The cost of projects has massively increased because of the cost of fuel and oil-based products, including bitumen and tar.  Tipperary County Council is in a perilous situation because it has exhausted most of its road and maintenance budget.  Now it is faced with a bill of up to &euro;500,000.  I understand from the director of services, through my daughter, Councillor M&aacute;ir&iacute;n McGrath, that a letter will be arriving in the Department imminently from James Swords, the senior engineer, and Paul Farrell who is also an engineer.  It will state this amount of money will be needed to repair the damage that has been done.<\/p>  <p>  The big problem is a lack of maintenance and lack of accountability.  The motorway was developed with compulsory purchase orders and we avail of it.  A project cannot be built and then walked away from.  We must go to the upper echelons of it and check the drainage and maintain it.  It is not just the motorway.  We have to have access in terms of fencing to prevent animals going on to it.  It is a serious situation.  The funding bill will be sent in.  Unsuspecting motorists drive on the motorway with torrents of rain crossing it because of the lack of drainage.  It is an extremely dangerous situation.  Many people have been seriously injured and worse on the motorway.  It is the same with the motorway to Limerick at Portlaoise.<\/p>  <p>  We have spent money on the motorways but we must maintain the curtilage and the percolation and drainage areas around them.  Above all we must protect life and limb.  We must also protect the property of farmers, householders and farmyards.  Above all we must protect households.  The council staff and the general services supervisor went out.  As I said here one day, one of them, Walter Doheny, suffered a minor heart attack while on duty at night.  He has recovered.  I spoke to him on Sunday and thanks be to God he is fine.  Council workers go out to try to sort it out as do fire brigades.  We should not be putting these people in this type of danger.

I know from the Deputy's contribution there was an intense rainfall event in County Tipperary over a short period of time.  I am aware that the flooding affected properties over quite an area.  Unfortunately these severe weather events are becoming more frequent and they highlight the need to focus on the measures needed to address climate change.<\/p>  <p>  As regards the impact on regional and local roads, I can confirm that Tipperary County Council has made initial contact with the Department.  It is understood, and I have picked up through Deputy McGrath who mentioned Councillor McGrath, that the council will be making a submission to the Department seeking funding to assist with repair works caused by the severe weather event.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to funding options for repair works, it is established practice that local authorities are advised by the Department that a contingency provision should be reserved from the overall resources available to each local authority for regional and local roads so as to deal with damage caused by severe weather conditions.  As regards the Department's grants, local authorities may carry out repairs from the regional and local road grants available to them and from their own resources.  In this context it is open to each council to determine and reprioritise its work programme following severe weather events.  Where this is not feasible, such as in this case as I gather from Deputy McGrath, the Department always tries to work with local authorities to facilitate the management of repair works in these situations.<\/p>  <p>  Once a submission is received from Tipperary County Council which identifies the works required together with an estimate of the cost, it will be reviewed by Department officials and the Department will liaise further with Tipperary County Council on the necessary repair works and the timing of the works.  In the event that national roads were affected in the manner described by the Deputy, Transport Infrastructure Ireland has stated that it is necessary to carry out a survey and hydrological assessment of the culverts and drains in the affected area to understand the cause behind the flooding and to quantify the details and costs of any works to be completed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102500070#SSS00300","speaker":"1602"},{"type":"speech","time":1666741800,"counter":584,"content":"<p>It is late at night and we are all tired but this is balderdash.

We have this folly every time we ask a question about flooding.  We hear about climate change.  It just does not cut it for me.  We are not climate change deniers but rivers are not cleaned and neither are gullies or streams.  What happens?  Every bit of dirt that runs off of this building ends up in a river, as is the case with every other building, field and roadway.  I do not say forget about climate change but we need to clean the river basins and above all maintain the motorways.  It makes me very angry to listen to people blame climate change.  We can get downpours of rain but if the gullies and culverts are cleaned and maintained, they will take 90% of it.  There might be a 10% to overflow.

I do not know how many people in the Minister of State's constituency of Mayo would be going to Magee college in Derry, Queen's University or Jordanstown.  It is the case that a student in west Donegal going to Galway who has a Leap card will get upwards of a 50% rebate on the cost of transportation to Ollscoil na Gaillimhe.  However, a student from that same parish in west Donegal who is going to Belfast does not get the rebate.  There is some sort of a nominal rebate as far as the Border but once the bus hits the Border there is no rebate.<\/p>  <p>  I am encouraged by some of the correspondence I have seen to the effect that there are ongoing discussions but, quite frankly, a meeting needs to be held.  Ongoing discussions means that there has been a meeting or maybe more than one meeting, but now there needs to be another meeting.  Heads need to be put together here because students feel discriminated against.<\/p>  <p>  Students have always gone to the North.  Traditionally, a big percentage of students from my county have gone across the Border and they feel discriminated against.  If the granny or granddad of one of these students has a pension and is over 66 years of age, she or he will get free transportation to Belfast.  I accept that this comes from a different Department, the Department of Social Protection.  I will set out the question I am putting to the Minister of State tonight.  If a senior citizen in west Donegal can get free transportation to Belfast, involving a 100% rebate from one Department, why does their grandson or granddaughter not get any rebate as a student in Belfast, Derry or Coleraine?  That is my case.<\/p>  <p>  I ask the Minister of State tonight, or rather this morning, to use his position to ask one of his own officials to make contact.  I do not know if officials from the National Transport Authority, NTA, will be up at this time of the morning listening to this debate.  No doubt they will not, but I hope that there will be follow-up.  This is a matter that can and should be, and certainly needs to be, resolved.  At the end of the day, if a student in Letterkenny heading down to the beautiful city of Galway is getting 50% back by having a Leap card and his or her next-door neighbour in Letterkenny going to Belfast has to pay the full whack, there is something wrong.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102500071#TTT00300","speaker":"1548"},{"type":"speech","time":1666742400,"counter":589,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy McHugh for raising this issue, which I am taking on behalf of the Minister for Transport, Deputy Eamon Ryan.  As Deputy McHugh confirmed, it relates to young adults travelling from the South to the North of Ireland using the Leap card scheme.  As the Deputy will be aware, the Department of Transport has responsibility for policy and overall funding in relation to public transport.  However, the Department is not involved in the day-to-day operation of public transport services.  The NTA has statutory responsibility for securing the provision of public passenger transport services nationally by way of public transport service contracts, and for the allocation of associated funding to the relevant operators.  I assure the House that the Government is strongly committed to providing all citizens with reliable and realistic sustainable mobility options.  Public transport plays a key role in the delivery of this goal.  In budget 2022, the Department of Transport secured &euro;538 million of funding for public service obligation, PSO, and Local Link services that are provided by State operators and are under contract by the NTA this year.<\/p>  <p>  As the House will be aware, in recognising the importance of incentivising more young people to use public transport, as part of budget 2022, the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, secured &euro;25 million of funding for the introduction of the young adult card.  This exciting initiative allows any person nationwide who is between the ages of 19 and 23 to avail of an entitlement to discounted travel costs, and to increase the level of discount over and above the current student discount to an average discount of 50% across all services, including city, intercity and rural services.  Mature students in full-time education are also included in the scheme as are eligible visitors to Ireland within the young adult age cohort.  The young adult card was initially introduced on PSO services on 9 May and then extended to participating commercial bus operators on 4 September.  This extension of the scheme to the commercial sector means that the 50% fare discount for holders of a young adult card - those aged between 19 and 23 - or student Leap card is now available on bus services provided by participating commercial bus operators.  It is important to note that this discount is in addition to the 20% average fare discount on PSO services that was introduced in May as part of a suite of Government measures to help to combat the rising cost of living.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy has raised an interesting anomaly, which is that the grandparents of some of these students are able to travel on an all-island basis.  I certainly will raise that with the Department of Transport.  I encourage the Deputy to raise the issue directly with the shared island unit in Roinn an Taoisigh to pursue that anomaly, but also to promote the shared island initiative.  This anomaly is something that should be further addressed in the context of the all-island strategic rail review.  I will certainly address it to the Department of Transport.

The Minister of State's suggestion about the shared island unit is an excellent one.<\/p>  <p>  In the brief time I have remaining, I want to raise a specific issue in relation to Creeslough.  We will have time set aside in two weeks to discuss in more depth the situation in the aftermath of the Creeslough tragedy.  The specific issue is that due to the ongoing investigation, the main route through Creeslough is closed.  Of the two pick-up and drop-off points for the community from Creeslough and even into Dunfanaghy, one is Falcarragh and the other is Termon.  I am asking tonight if we could get somebody from the Department of Transport to reach out to a member of the community - I can facilitate that - to try to introduce a short-term shuttle service for people who wish to avail of this transport.<\/p> <p>People who avail of public transport do not have a car, so they are looking to get taxis or to get neighbours to take them farther distances.  This is very frustrating for so many people.<\/p> <p> I would ask for a contact person in the Department to give me a ring me tomorrow.  I can link them up with a member of the community to put that service in place.  We are probably only talking about a week.  I do not know how long the investigation will continue; it is potentially another week.  I do not have that information, as it is a prerogative of the Garda.<\/p> <p> One of the answers I will get back will be there has to be a tendering process.  We have to use our common sense here.  People are still dealing with this enormous tragedy, and the tragedy will be with the community for a long time into the future.  It is about what we can do now in the short window we have available to fix things with a bit of common sense, such as a person picking up the phone and trying to get this sorted.  I think it can be done.  In fairness to Donegal County Council and all the Departments, they are all working hard to try to do the right and best thing.  This is just one little thing that could help enormously.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102500071#TTT00500","speaker":"1548","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1666743000,"counter":592,"content":"<p>Our thoughts and prayers continue to be with the families of the bereaved and injured, indeed, with the entire community of Creeslough and with all of our public representative colleagues.
