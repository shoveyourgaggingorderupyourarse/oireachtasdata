This is the first time that RT&Eacute; has been invited to attend before this committee, and we welcome the opportunity to engage with national legislators and policymakers on this important issue.  As we understand it, the purpose of this committee session is to explore some of the ways in which RT&Eacute; can contribute to the broader discussions and awareness relating to climate change.  In that regard, this engagement is especially timely as it coincides with a range of editorial opportunities that we are exploring at this time.<br\/><br\/>As Ireland&rsquo;s leading national public service media entity, RT&Eacute; plays a unique role in Irish life and society.  With a 94% weekly reach across all adults in the country across our services, we continue to play a central role in the national conversations.  That is a position that we never take for granted.  As a dual-funded broadcaster, RT&Eacute; receives approximately 50% of its overall operating costs from the licence fee collected from the public.  For that, RT&Eacute; must deliver against a very wide-ranging remit which includes national and international news coverage, the provision of an Irish language media service, the provision of online services, orchestras and performing groups, a national media archive and the coverage of national sports.<br\/><br\/>RT&Eacute; plays a trusted and important role in informing Irish citizens and in shaping national debate.  Coverage of climate change and environmental issues has been regularly reflected in both news and current affairs coverage and across many other different types of programming.  A cursory review of coverage over the past six months on this issue demonstrates that RT&Eacute; is making genuine efforts to engage with this subject across a diverse range of output and from a wide range of perspectives.  Apart from dedicated reportage in long running programmes such as &quot;Eco Eye&quot; or consistent analysis and reports from our correspondent Mr. George Lee, the topic is well reflected in output which ranges from bespoke children&rsquo;s games and programmes on RT&Eacute;jr, current affairs debate on radio and on television, long form articles and opinion pieces on <i>www.rte.ie<\/i>, exploration of the moral and ethical considerations on programmes in worship and faith related programmes, and putting the topic in more localised context in output such as &quot;Big Week on The Farm&quot; and &quot;Science Week&quot; on RT&Eacute;.  Beyond that the more global impacts are reflected in programmes such as &quot;This Week&quot; and &quot;What in the World&quot;.<br\/><br\/>Efforts are being made to make the topic relevant, accessible, and in regular focus in relevant sectoral debates such as those on programmes such as &quot;Countrywide&quot; or &quot;Ear to the Ground&quot;.  The subject has also been well represented in various political debate programmes such as &quot;Drivetime&quot;, &quot;Today with Sean O&rsquo;Rourke&quot;, &quot;Late Debate&quot;, or &quot;Saturday with Cormac &Oacute; hEadra&quot;.  It has also featured on prime time flagship entertainment programmes such as &quot;The Late Late Show&quot;, with questions on this issue being raised with former President Mary Robinson and the Taoiseach, to give two recent examples.<br\/><br\/>The topic of climate change can be perceived as complex and somewhat removed from day-to-day life.  In terms of our own editorial contribution, however, we are trying our best to ensure that it is explored and discussed from many perspectives to meet the needs of different audiences.  That is not to say that there is room for complacency.  The coverage of climate change, and other sustainability topics is a matter of ongoing review in terms of our editorial activities, and we have renewed ambition in this regard for 2019.  By way of example, some of our plans include making it the theme of one of our Big Picture projects, which is a themed week of programming exploring a particular topic with depth and range across the unique range of multiplatform services that RT&Eacute; offers.<\/p><p>Giving a single topic such concentrated focus and amplification can deliver significant impacts in terms of public attention and action.  We are also looking at our lifestyle programming to explore ways in which we can make some of the mitigating actions seem more relevant and more accessible.  Given the growing levels of public interest and concern around this issue, the topic of climate change will be a thematic priority in our news and current affairs coverage.  We are also exploring partnerships and imaginative approaches in terms of messaging this to younger audiences through our RT&Eacute;jr services.<\/p><p> However, notwithstanding our own reach and remit, as well as the importance of national media in general, I would caution that if there is an ambition at a broader political level to create mass awareness on climate change and related corrective action, there is no substitute for bespoke public information campaigns, as well as a correlating level of leadership actions and policy implementation.<\/p><p> The State routinely and effectively develops public information campaigns focused on communicating clear and easily understood pathways to practical action by citizens around broad areas such as healthy living, road safety, nutrition and so on.  While such campaigns to be effective must be accompanied by substantive and coherent policies and incentives, they are essential in bringing about the broad understanding critical to changing behaviour.  On a broader point, if there is little by way of action on climate change in terms of legislative change, policy initiatives, parliamentary debate and business innovation, regrettably there is less for the media as a whole to report on.<\/p><p> Perhaps this is one of the other ways in which RT&Eacute; can demonstrate its value.  The work of RT&Eacute; is only possible with the support of Irish citizens.  It exists to serve the needs of those citizens.  Among those needs is the requirement for an independent media voice which will hold the powerful to account on what they are doing and what they are not.<\/p><p> Arising from their wide-ranging deliberations, the Citizens&rsquo; Assembly delivered a focused range of cogent recommendations for action.  There are clearly ways in which as a country, as a society and at an individual level we can make a contribution.  RT&Eacute; is keen to play its part within this framework and within this conversation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2019011600002#L00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Dee Forbes","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1547647200,"counter":9,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Forbes.

It was also a great honour for Met &Eacute;ireann to present at the Citizens' Assembly in 2017.<\/p> <p>  Met &Eacute;ireann is the Irish national meteorological service, as recognised by the UN Convention of the World Meteorological Organization, WMO, a specialised agency of the United Nations.  Established in 1936, Met &Eacute;ireann&rsquo;s mission is to monitor, analyse and predict Ireland's weather and climate, as well as to provide a range of high-quality meteorological and related information to the public.  This is focused on supporting public safety and promoting wider societal and economic well-being through the delivery of timely, actionable and reliable science-based weather and climate information.<\/p> <p>  In December 2017, Met &Eacute;ireann put in place its ten-year strategy to help Irish society to be ready for and responsive to weather and climate risks with the vision of making Ireland weather and climate prepared.<\/p> <p>  Weather and climate science is intrinsically international in nature.  The global network of national meteorological services collaborates internationally to share information, along with building the expertise and knowledge needed to support and develop the global predictive capability available for weather and climate systems.  Met &Eacute;ireann represents Ireland and actively contributes to the WMO, the European Organisation for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites, EUMETSAT, and the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts, ECMWF, which, among other things, is responsible for the implementation of the EU Copernicus Climate Change Service.<\/p><p>Met &Eacute;ireann&rsquo;s public services are based on knowledge-leading, scientific expertise and capacity, developed in co-operation with a wide range of leading international scientific collaborative networks including the EC-Earth climate modelling research consortium, the HIRLAM numerical weather prediction consortium and EUMETNET, the European meteorological services network.<\/p><p> Met &Eacute;ireann places a major focus on our international collaborative partnerships as they allow it to successfully build strategic national capacity and capabilities, while providing Ireland with the best possible weather and climate services based on world-leading expertise.  Such co-operation and collaboration was at the foundation of how the international scientific community has detected and helped develop an understanding of the challenge of climate change, which brings me to the global context for climate change.<\/p><p> Climate change is a reality.  It is likely that the world is now warmer than at any time during the past 125,000 years.  The past four years were the warmest on record globally with the most pronounced warming in the Arctic.  Latest indications show the average temperature of the past five years was 1.1&deg; Celsius above the pre-industrial era.  Last year was more than 0.4&deg; Celsius warmer than the average temperature from 1981 to 2010.  This warming is directly linked to increases in anthropogenic greenhouse gases, which are also higher in concentration now than any time in the past 800,000 years.  Further warming is inevitable due to the continuing rapid and record rise in human produced greenhouse gases.<\/p><p> This global warming is now impacting global weather patterns.  This includes changes in circulation patterns leading to, for example, changes in the Asian monsoon, changes to the behaviour of the jet stream, more heatwaves and droughts worldwide, increased flood events, as well as slower moving and more moisture-bearing hurricanes or typhoons.  The frequency, severity and probability of extreme weather have also increased globally.  Recent extreme events in Ireland, such as the flooding of 2015-16, including Storm Desmond, Storm Ophelia and Storm Emma, as well as the recent summer drought of 2018, are all consistent with, and part of, the trend of more frequent high-impact weather events.<\/p><p> How does global warming affect weather patterns in Ireland?  Ireland currently benefits from a temperate oceanic climate with abundant rainfall in a predominantly westerly atmospheric circulation, moderated by the North Atlantic Drift with little in the way of temperature extremes.  It is worth noting we have always had extreme weather in the past such as downpours, flooding, droughts, cold spells and windstorms.  However, with increased global warming, Ireland is likely to experience a less dependable, less stable climate with more frequent and intense extreme weather events.  In general, modelled projections show the Irish climate is trending towards a reduction in overall rainfall, particularly in spring and summer, along with more heavy rainfall events in autumn and winter.  Heatwaves and droughts are becoming more probable and all seasons will be warmer with more hot days and fewer frosts.  The overall number of storms affecting Ireland is likely to decrease.  The number of extreme damaging storms, however, could increase.  This, coupled with expected sea level rise, is likely to lead to an increased risk of coastal erosion and storm surges.<\/p><p> Ireland&rsquo;s response to climate change is informed by national predictive capability.  Met &Eacute;ireann&rsquo;s key role in meeting the challenge of climate change has been the development of national climate modelling capability.  Table No. 1 in the annexe to my submission shows the development of this predictive capacity over the past 15 years.  This strategic national resource has supported the formulation of climate change adaptation and mitigation strategies in Ireland over that period.<\/p><p>As members will see in the table, our climate modelling effort began in 2003 with C4i, a joint project between Met &Eacute;ireann and UCD funded by the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, and Science Foundation Ireland, SFI.  In 2008 Met &Eacute;ireann joined the international EC-EARTH climate modelling consortium working with leading experts from 12 European countries to develop and run state-of-the-art climate projections which were then accepted and used in the IPCC fifth assessment report.  Between 2009 and 2015 Met &Eacute;ireann, with the Irish Centre for High-End Computing, ICHEC, developed the most recent model projection for Ireland&rsquo;s projected climate change.  Currently, Met &Eacute;ireann is engaged in the next phase of EC-EARTH global model projections and regional climate model projections for Ireland, the outputs of which will be available for use by the wider climate change research community.  Met &Eacute;ireann&rsquo;s analysis of the EC- EARTH global model output will be available during 2020, the findings of which are expected to be used by the IPCC in its sixth assessment report.<br\/><br\/>How do we unlock all of this scientific information and use it to promote climate action?  As part of &quot;Making Ireland Weather and Climate Prepared&quot;,<i><\/i>Met &Eacute;ireann is expanding its range of operational, high quality, user oriented climate information and prediction services.  This is to support understanding and decision making in managing climate dependent risks for Ireland.  This enhanced service will build on Met &Eacute;ireann&rsquo;s existing climate services.  They include: the management of Ireland's national climate archive of quality controlled reference climate observations; the dissemination of climate products based on historical and current climate data; publication of synthesis reports on climate projections for Ireland; the development and dissemination of the award winning M&Eacute;RA<i><\/i>re-analysis of the Irish climate and also other sector specific climate products, for example, for the agriculture sector.<br\/><br\/>The enhanced climate information and prediction services will involve providing climate information for citizens, decision makers and policy makers via an interactive, integrated national climate information hub equipped with interpretative tools to contextualise expected states of Ireland&rsquo;s future climate and to enable understanding of climate risks at local level.  The information provided will be user driven and support decision making for specific sectors such as agriculture, health, transport and energy to help further develop the understanding of climate dependent risks.  Met &Eacute;ireann is also building capacity in event attribution and actively involved in the development of a state-of-the-art, pilot event attribution service as part the EUPHEME<i><\/i>European research project.  To support adaptation, Met &Eacute;ireann is also developing flood forecasting capability in conjunction with the Office of Public Works, OPW.  Leveraging the latest developments in meteorological science, Met &Eacute;ireann is developing local scale services extending from monthly forecasts and seasonal projections through to climate projections and analysis, based on state-of-the art ECMWF, Copernicus and EC-EARTH<i><\/i>projections.<br\/><br\/>Turning to communication of climate information to the citizen, Met &Eacute;ireann&rsquo;s primary motivation when communicating with the people is to help to protect life and property and to promote economic and social well-being on the basis of the best available, evidence based information.  Met &Eacute;ireann&rsquo;s existing communication channels include its work with RT&Eacute; and other TV and radio broadcasters; its new website and app and extensive social media reach; its public outreach via its citizen-science climate observer network; seminars; workshops; conferences and through its partnership with the Irish Meteorological Society; its work with print media; its educational resources; its participation in the BT Young Scientist &amp;amp; Technology Exhibition; the National Ploughing Championships; science week; mathematics week and so forth.<\/p><p> Met &Eacute;ireann is now building on its extensive experience of communication and engagement with the public to raise awareness and understanding of how the Irish climate is changing.  This work will include expanding our network of citizen scientists through the weather observations website, WOW, an interactive digital platform that will be launched during 2019.  WOW will allow for more community involvement in directly contributing to our understanding of our changing climate and weather patterns.  Met &Eacute;ireann is also planning to expand its capacity for media engagement and to increase its contributions to scientific programming on the topic of weather and climate, primarily with the public broadcaster RT&Eacute; but also through wider engagement with commercial broadcasters.  This involves developing climate specific educational segments for TV, the web and social media.  In particular, these segments will be used when educational opportunities arise such as in the aftermath of an extreme weather event or when weather or climate related news items occur.<\/p><p> While recognising the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment's responsibility for climate action and its overall national co-ordination role in the communication of climate change information, these communication initiatives by Met &Eacute;ireann are intended to support the wider national climate action agenda through enhanced public awareness and understanding of the causes and impacts of climate change, founded on evidence based scientific information.  This information will support Ireland&rsquo;s national adaptation and mitigation plans by aiding citizens in making informed choices regarding the realities of climate change impacts.<\/p><p> I again thank the committee for giving me this opportunity to provide evidence.  I am happy to provide further clarification, as required.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2019011600002#M00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Eoin Moran","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1547647200,"counter":14,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Moran.

We spend much time with experts discussing the challenges of the issue, but - it is clear from its presentation that Met &Eacute;ireann is aware of this - the other key part is how to try to bring people with us because we know that we must bring about significant behavioural change.  We must do that and take personal responsibility for doing it, but how do we try to bring people with us?  Our experience in the past has been that when we get these things wrong, not only is there political fallout as a result but the environment also loses.  That is something we have to avoid.  In some ways, it is a job of work to bring people with us on that journey of behavioural change.  Some citizens are ahead of us, particularly the younger generation which probably has much to teach us.  I was struck by this at the BT Young Scientist &amp;amp; Technology Exhibition and it was very refreshing to see it.<\/p> <p>  I wish to raise some points with the representatives of RT&Eacute; and Met &Eacute;ireann about the programmes they run on news and general current affairs and the opportunities they have each day, given that their reach is phenomenal, to present abnormal weather events and plant the seed in people's heads that this is not normal.  My first question is for Ms Forbes.  <\/p> <p>  The BBC recently updated its editorial policy for journalists on how to report climate change.  As part of it, the BBC has indicated that since the science is now clearer and climate change is accepted as happening, climate change deniers are not required on panels for balance, as they would have been.  It has also invited editorial staff to sign up for a training course on reporting climate change.  Does RT&Eacute; have a policy on the inclusion or non-inclusion of climate change deniers in shows that are discussing this issue at length?  Has RT&Eacute; changed the way it reports on climate change as the science has become more clear?  Has its staff received any training in reporting on climate change?<\/p> <p>  With regard to the need for balance, how does RT&Eacute; try to ensure it balances its coverage between reporting on the need for Government policies to address both climate and behavioural change and the potential negative responses from certain groups that might oppose it?  While I was driving my car last week, I heard a report on a news bulletin about a protest in Dublin.<\/p><p>It went into detail about the protest and at the end of the report there was mention of there being about a dozen or more people involved.  The mental picture in my head was thousands of people out on the street protesting, until I heard the last bit of the report.  The balance needs to be right with regard to the element of proportionality and in reporting on legitimate protests or in nearly inciting people to go out and making them feel bad if they are not out protesting.  I would like to hear the RT&Eacute; witnesses' views on that.<\/p><p> Is RT&Eacute; seeing an increased demand from viewers and listeners for material that addresses climate change in programmes such as \"Eco Eye\" or special \"Prime Time\" segments?  If so, is RT&Eacute; ramping up its coverage or does it plan to increase its coverage on that?<\/p><p>I have some brief questions for Met &Eacute;ireann.  As the national weather service what does it see as its role and responsibility around communicating the reality of climate change to Irish people?  I acknowledge again, along with RT&Eacute;, the progress Met &Eacute;ireann has made in recent months on its website and improvements in different areas.  From the presentation I take it there is a very high level of elements and policies but I still believe that primarily, first and foremost Met &Eacute;ireann's strongest reach is after the \"Six One News\" and at the \"Nine O'Clock News\" onwards with the weather bulletins - and I acknowledge the presence of Ms Evelyn Cusack here today.  I am a farmer and always turn on the television for that bulletin, especially on a Sunday.  I am very struck that some of my constituents have commented positively to me that it is lovely to see the daffodils out in January before the snowdrops, and that the cherry blossoms are starting to blossom.  Personally that frightens the life out of me.  I am really worried that it has been such a mild January if this is to be part of a bigger picture.  Plenty of people have said to me that it is lovely to get a bit of snow again in the winter and to have a really warm summer.  I can understand all of that but I believe there is a fear inherent in this if we think this is all just fine and if we do not see it as part of the four warmest years in 125,000 years.  It is frightening.  We should be a little bit scared if we want to bring people on the journey of very significant behavioural change that we need to bring them on.  They need to understand that this is not normal, as the science is telling us.  Does Met &Eacute;ireann have a policy of infiltrating that? When Met &Eacute;ireann is reporting on a very mild January is there a way it could subtly reference that by saying it is not normal, that it does not happen very often and that it is a worrying trend?  They are my main points.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2019011600002#P00300","speaker":"1237","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1547647200,"counter":17,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Heydon.

The Deputy asked if we are seeing an increase in demand from viewers and listeners.  It is fair to say that when a topic becomes more interesting and is more discussed, we see an increased need and appetite for more in that area.  This particular area right now is in that place.  We aired a programme on Monday night, for example, which was \"One Day: How Ireland Cleans Up\".  It looked at how we are tackling waste in the State.  That programme on Monday evening had more than one third of the country watching it.  This tells us very quickly and easily that there is demand.  A number of years ago that same programme would not have had that sense of engagement.  Likewise across our radio shows, if one looks at the breadth of radio on a given week across RT&Eacute;, one will see peppered across the schedule a lot of engagement from listeners on this topic.  It is very fair to say that we are getting much more engagement, and as a result we will then aim to cover more and more.  Following that Monday show, Claire Byrne had a segment on how we could reduce our waste.  There is no doubt that it is a topic of our time and therefore we are addressing the topic in our news and current affairs programming and in other programming.  I will ask my colleague Mr. Jon Williams in current affairs to address how we are treating the topic in news and current affairs.  Mr. Jim Jennings, our director of content, will then outline how we cover the topic in our other content.  It is the breadth of content across RT&Eacute; that will reflect all of that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2019011600002#Q00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Dee Forbes"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1547647200,"counter":19,"content":"<p>Perhaps I can deal with the issue raised by the Deputy about the BBC's guidelines.  The context matters.  The BBC produced its editorial guidance after it was found to be in breach of the UK communications' regulator Ofcom guidelines in reporting climate change.  As part of the mitigation the BBC has issued guidance to its staff on how to report climate change.  \"The Today Programme\" failed in its obligation to be fair and impartial by, essentially, equating and providing equivalence between the science and climate change sceptics.<\/p><p>RT&Eacute; has not been found to be in breach of Broadcasting Authority of Ireland guidelines.  We are very clear that we do have guidance.  Section 39 (1) of the Broadcasting Act requires RT&Eacute; to be fair and impartial across a whole range of subject areas.  The reporting of climate change is no different from the reporting of homelessness, Brexit, health or criminal justice.  We are not obliged to provide balance and we do not balance different perspectives, but we are obliged to be fair and impartial.  We strive to do that across all of the different subject areas we cover.<\/p><p> The director general has referenced the increasing engagement by audiences.  We can always do more but during the recent climate change summit in Poland RT&Eacute; did pieces pretty much every second day on climate change.  We are responding to the increased interest we recognise from the audience.  We are a responsive organisation and we live or die by the engagement we have with our audiences.

We are commissioning more documentaries as we speak.  We have another two and possibly three landmark documentaries coming up within the next 12 months looking at this area.  This is not just based on public demand for more information, it is also coming from our staff who are very engaged on this.

There was a lot in those questions so I will pass over to Ms Evelyn Cusack and Mr. S&eacute;amus Walsh for a few of the issues.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy asked if there were subtle ways in which we can communicate climate information to the public.  Part of the job of science is to explain and not just to provide facts, figures and do all the research.  It is very important to be able to provide an explanation to the public.  With regard to whether Met &Eacute;ireann has a strategy in strengthening, improving and expanding our climate information proposition to the public we have our ten year strategy.  This speaks a lot about ensuring that users, citizens, decision makers, policy makers and politicians are informed so as to be able to make the correct decisions and to achieve the best outcomes for society.  This gets to the core of our approach to any services we provide, be they in weather or climate.  We focus on providing the most relevant and salient information to allow the best decisions to be made for society.  This is supporting impact-based decision making.  We must understand the impacts people have to deal with around weather or climate, and then we must provide the most relevant and easily accessible information possible.  That is at the core of the philosophy behind the strategy.<\/p> <p>  On communicating climate information, standing back and looking at where we have come from, our role is to provide the scientific bedrock for the scientific projections we have and to understand the future climate for Ireland over the coming few decades.<\/p><p>That is in place.  What we are now doing is building on what we have called our climate services.  I have outlined this in my statement.  This is to allow people to have access to specialist information so that they can serve themselves and make their own decisions - ordinary citizens, policy makers and specialist users.  On top of that layer, we are focusing on improving our communications - enhancing our existing communications so that we can enhance understanding.  <\/p><p> In the context of improving citizens' or the Irish public's understanding in a subtle way and answering those questions about burnt grass during the drought in summer or phenological responses taking place as we speak relating to warm conditions, this is an event attribution exercise.  For many years, Met &Eacute;ireann has looked at developing and enhancing our capacity in event attribution.  As I mentioned in my statement, we are involved in a state-of-the-art European research attribution service that will deliver on a semi-operational basis attribution information relating to weather events on a regular basis, be it seasonal or monthly.  There may be an opportunity to provide a more rapid attribution service to the public, which would answer the type of questions raised by the Deputy.  We have seen very useful examples of this during the drought in 2018.  The science is now ready to provide that type of information.  It is like a newly-developed drug for a particular disease.  It is in research and we are moving towards transposing this highly-useful and very exciting and promising piece of information into an operational service, which is a different task entirely.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2019011600002#R00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Eoin Moran","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1547647200,"counter":28,"content":"<p>I am conscious of time because we have a number of other speakers.

I am very glad to say that since then, we have developed to the point where we are up to five to seven days ahead.  As the Deputy mentioned, the farming forecast on RT&Eacute; is of great importance.  We concentrate on the weather forecast, warnings and advisories for the safety of the public during that slot.  Very occasionally, we mention climate change.  We have plans to bring it in in a more organised way - perhaps at the end of each season - and to bring in more WMR and IPCC reports.

He mentioned the latest research.  The next challenge is to make that information available on an operational basis.  One thing we can say and have been saying relatively recently in respect of severe weather events is that they are part of the general trend in global warming.  For example, during the heatwave, we were able to say it was part of the trend in global warming.  A rapid attribution study was carried out that said that the heatwave over Ireland last summer was twice as likely to have occurred because of human-induced climate change.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2019011600002#S00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. S&eacute;amus Walsh"},{"type":"speech","time":1547647200,"counter":33,"content":"<p>I will be brief because my predecessor covered a lot.  The challenge facing us as an Oireachtas is to try to engage with the public to make the reality of climate change an acceptable phenomenon for it, to try to put in place a series of measures to change the behaviour of the public that the public will find acceptable and to do so in a way that the public does not feel it is being foisted on it for any reason other than improving the lives of members of the public and the lives of their children.<\/p><p>Notwithstanding the widespread acceptance of climate change, because the basis of it is scientific and, consequently, academic, much of the debate has taken place in that forum.  We have all busied ourselves to some extent looking at targets, percentage movements, a percent here or there and a degree here or there.  We know the buzzwords and acronyms and those of us on all sides who must engage with it are comfortable to some extent.  However, the eyes of the public glaze over when faced with that kind of communication.  It is all about communication.  Let us forget about trying to fight the battle on whether climate change is a reality.  That fight is over because climate change is a given.  Of course, Met &Eacute;ireann will involve itself very specifically in the science so that it provides the evidence base for the future.  As Ms Cusack identified, most people tune into the weather forecast to find out what tomorrow will be like.  They are now doing so on apps.  <\/p><p> The difficulty we will face is communicating what needs to happen next, the actions that must be taken and the policy decisions that must be made.  We need to move away from the academic debate and the scientific basis for it and speak the common language.  Mr. Moran spoke about the burning of grass because of the sun.  People understand that.  Farmers understand that.  Everybody understands that.  <\/p><p> RT&Eacute; does a very good job with the news.  George Lee's appointment was an excellent decision and I think he has done exceptionally well in marrying the two sometimes conflicting roles of environment and agriculture.  When I saw it initially, I wondered how it would work out but it has worked really well from my perspective because I see his capacity to explain in very clear language and to tell the story in a non-scientific way.  He has the language.  Perhaps he benefitted to some extent from being a Member of the Oireachtas for a period in terms of enabling him to communicate with the public at large.  That is good.  <\/p><p> It is about how we move this issue from news and current affairs and into everyday life.  Even the fact that RT&Eacute; has brought in people from both sides of its house is welcome.  The ratings show that \"Room to Improve\", which is presented by Dermot Bannon, is a hugely successful programme.  He tells really good stories.  One of the major issues has been the loss of heat and how we are heating homes unnecessarily.  If this was overlaid with the climate change agenda, carbon footprint, the loss of heat and ensuring that room is made for electric vehicles, looking to the future would be very much part of that and telling that story.  There is work and potential there.  <\/p><p> There is also potential in RT&Eacute;'s soaps.  I am not a regular viewer but sometimes I am subjected to one such programme at home if I am there at a particular time.  I have watched over the years how \"Fair City\" deals with important social issues such as violence against women and migration.  The scriptwriters handle these issues very successfully and blend them in without setting them apart so they are inculcated into everyday life.  There are opportunities there.  If we are to be successful, we must make this issue mainstream and get away from it being just climate change.  It has to be part of life, which is the challenge for us.  RT&Eacute; can play an important role in that regard.  <\/p><p> My only question concerns what the witnesses are looking for from us.  Is Met &Eacute;ireann funded adequately to gear up in the manner in which it is gearing up?  Does it require additional funding?  Does that need to be factored into our budgetary provisions?  I address the same question to RT&Eacute;.  We previously discussed the funding of public service broadcasting in the Oireachtas Committee on Communications, Climate Action and Environment.  RT&Eacute; gets additional funding from the sound and vision fund.<\/p><p>Should we look into ring-fencing some of the fund for items other than current affairs public service content?  Should we consider requiring some or all of it to be used in reporting on climate change issues?  The answer is probably that RT&Eacute; will not refuse any money it is offered.  Have the delegates given consideration to proposals that ring-fenced funds play a greater role in supporting such communication?<\/p><p> Ms Forbes mentioned public information broadcasting.  I welcome ideas she has to provide good quality public information.  People tend to find ways to scroll or move beyond public information notices in adopting a somewhat similar approach to that taken to advertising on the RT&Eacute; player; therefore, such information would have to be presented in a very clever manner that would engage citizens.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2019011600002#S00700","speaker":"1274","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1547647200,"counter":36,"content":"<p>Deputy Dooley has made a very strong and clear point about telling the story.  We always endeavour to tell the story to the best of our ability across multiple genres.  There is no doubt that climate change is a complex issue to understand and that we have work to do in that respect.  We are constantly investigating and evaluating programme ideas in this space and always welcome ideas for new programming.  It has been widely recognised that the \"Operation Transformation\" programme has been of great benefit to health.  Ten or 15 years ago that might have seemed impossible.  We are looking at and encouraging ideas from a broad spectrum of programme makers.  As I mentioned in my opening statement, we are looking at lifestyle programming to see if we can come up with a programme as effective as \"Operation Transformation\".  It is early days, but we are investigating the matter.  My colleague, Mr. Jennings, may wish to elaborate in that regard.<\/p> <p>  We must be very careful that this issue is not brought into programming in a manner that could be interpreted as preachy or finger wagging.  We are very conscious of this, which is why children are having a significant impact in this space, particularly in children's programming.  As a previous speaker mentioned, we are learning a lot from children in this space.  We are working on ideas for how we can use children's programming to help everybody in this space.  It is fair to say we are investigating across a wide range of genres.  This is not just about news and current affairs, which are very important.  The topic will be brought into more and more genres of programming.<\/p> <p>  On Deputy Dooley's point about information and public service, it is not the role of RT&Eacute; to come up with such ideas, but we are very happy to engage and be part of that discussion because a public service campaign becomes truly impactful when citizens know what they can do to make a change.  As I mentioned, in areas such as road safety and health people knew what they were required to do and there was the public service area of communication to back it up.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2019011600002#U00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Dee Forbes"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1547647200,"counter":37,"content":"<p>Does Mr. Jennings wish to add anything?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2019011600002#U00300","nonspeaker":"Chairman"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1547647200,"counter":38,"content":"<p>I will do so quickly because I know that the committee is under time pressure.  <\/p> <p>  We work very closely with Met &Eacute;ireann and have done so for several years.

As I will have to leave to speak in the D&aacute;il to the motion on nurses, I will not take too long.  <\/p><p>RT&Eacute; in its submission states the topic of climate change will be a thematic priority in its news and current affairs coverage.  I ask the delegates to flesh out that point, although I do not expect them to present a thesis on the matter.  There has been much discussion of children and young people and their awareness of this issue, which is greater than that of my generation or the generation after mine, and how they will play a leading role.  Studies have shown the extent to which children influence adults, including a study of how the decision to buy a particular type of car is 60% attributable to what one's children say about cars.  That is a very well known fact.  Therefore, the more we do to encourage children, the more it will impact on their parents, other relations and the older generation.<\/p><p>A protest by children against climate change will take place next Saturday outside Leinster House at 4 p.m.  In spite of Deputy Heydon's comments on a protest being attended by 12 people and the RT&Eacute; news report making it sound like it was an enormous protest, it would be a wonderful event for RT&Eacute; to cover.  Although I have not seen any coverage of it in the Irish media, there has been a strike by schoolchildren in Australia against coal mining and the coal being transported out of Australia through the Great Barrier Reef which has been seriously damaged.  A young woman in Sweden has made amazing speeches on climate change.  Such events should receive news coverage because they would have an impact on children and their parents.<\/p><p>I understand what Ms Forbes stated about the role of RT&Eacute;, but in its written submission it points out that there is no substitute for bespoke public information campaigning.  Although I agree to some extent, I disagree that it is just about changing public behaviour and individual behaviour, which is often the focus of this committee.  There must be a far greater focus on changing corporate behaviour and the activities of oil companies and the coal and gas industries.  I am not aware of any serious journalistic attempt by RT&Eacute; to explore the issue of corporate behaviour in the context of climate change.  That is a task it should take on.<\/p><p>In its submission RT&Eacute; states broadcasting depends on the actions of the Oireachtas in making legislative change.  The Petroleum and Other Minerals Development (Amendment) (Climate Emergency Measures) Bill 2018 in my name is quite controversial and ended up in limbo following a vote of the Joint Committee on Communications, Climate Action and Environment before Christmas.  It is of great interest because it challenges the oil and fossil fuels industry and proposes that fossil fuels be kept in the ground and that there be no further extraction or issuing of licences to extract fossil fuels in coastal regions.  However, it has been given very little coverage by RT&Eacute;.  When I have discussed it on news programmes such as the one presented by Cormac &Oacute; hEadhra, I have been given very little time to explain it.  I do not accept that it is all about academics and science.  If children understand it, we can too, but we need to name it.  If we do not do so, we are doing a disservice.<\/p><p>That brings me on to my questions for Met &Eacute;ireann.  I note that Mr. Moran is a permanent representative to the World Meteorological Organization.  He knows that its recent report really nails the issue by identifying climate change as the problem in terms of extreme weather.  Met &Eacute;ireann could do far more in that regard.  I was very pleased that it addressed human-induced climate change in a weather report in early January, but in its submission today it discusses weather and climate science.  Is it reluctant to call it climate change science?  I am sure Mr. Moran accepts the science because he is part of the scientific community.  There should not be a reluctance to acknowledge it.  A news report on the <i>journal.ie <\/i>website before Christmas stated Met &Eacute;ireann staff had been told not to link specific extreme weather events with climate change.  Met &Eacute;ireann has explained that one event does not necessarily result from climate change, that it must be a series of events in order to be so identified.  However, at this stage we should state clearly that a series of extreme weather events is taking place because of climate change.  That should be done because we are trying to educate the public.  At the heart of what Met &Eacute;ireann, RT&Eacute; and the Oireachtas are trying to do are the raising of public awareness and pointing out to the system that this is not acceptable.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2019011600002#V00100","speaker":"1367"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1547647200,"counter":40,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for her questions.<\/p><p>I want to make it very clear that Met &Eacute;ireann takes the whole question of climate change very seriously and has underpinned the information available to Ireland to manage, adapt and put mitigation strategies in place.  I mean this quite sincerely; Met &Eacute;ireann is part of the international scientific community that since the 1900s has been monitoring and taking the pulse of the planet on a minute-by-minute, hourly and daily basis.  It has contributed to the detection of climate change and on an ongoing basis it provides the definitive reference analysis of the state of the climate.  It has initiated the national programme to provide climate projections for the country.  It was the first scientific organisation to do that for the country.  I will be brief on this.  National meteorological services provide that strategic outlook on a scientific basis.  They provide long-range plans to meet the requirements of the country from a scientific point of view.  On that basis, Met &Eacute;ireann has had the view that climate change is a great challenge for the last several decades.  It is a huge challenge for this country, and Met &Eacute;ireann has responded strategically to meet that challenge and to service the Irish public and Irish citizens in that manner.  <\/p><p> In regard to some the articles that have been referred to and some of the questions that have been asked, of course it is true that for the last several years the public has been quite rightly seeking explanations for the increased frequency of extreme weather events we are all experiencing.  I can tell the committee that these extreme weather events are putting us to the pin of our collar.  In terms of communications, we are at the front line when it comes to climate change.  The introduction of weather warnings and our storm naming mechanism were initiatives taken by Met &Eacute;ireann.  We are at the vanguard in communicating the impacts of extreme weather and the changes therein caused by climate change.  There is no ambiguity.  We have always had the position that the climate is changing.  In regard to the communication that we provide for our forecasters, of course we have to give guidance on how to speak to journalists.  This is because within the language of climate change there can often be some confusion.  <\/p><p> I wish to clarify that our role is to provide climate information to the public.  Again, this is to support users, decision-makers, policymakers and politicians to help them to make their decisions.  I note that this is also to support the wider climate action agenda as co-ordinated and managed by the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2019011600002#V00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Eoin Moran","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1547647200,"counter":42,"content":"<p>I apologise to Mr. Moran because he seems to be a little bit defensive.

We began last year by addressing the issue of homelessness.  Last spring we looked at mental health; just before Christmas we looked at the place of women in Ireland in 2018.  The success of \"The Big Picture\" has been to reach out beyond the core news and current affairs programmes.  For example, it has engaged 2FM on mental health.

There has been reference to legislative action and what happens here.  I held this brief in the previous D&aacute;il as Sinn F&eacute;in spokesperson on the environment.  I was part of the group that produced the committee report for the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act 2015 in 2013 and 2014.  I acknowledge that this subject was not as big at that time.  However, other committee members and I were trying to get it covered.  It needed more attention.  Deputy Smith mentioned one Bill.  I have introduced numerous Bills here that never saw the light of day on any channel, including RT&Eacute;.  I refer to the Microgeneration Support Scheme Bill 2017, which is mainstream stuff in Germany and right across Europe.  I introduced the Waste Reduction (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2017.  I brought forward a policy for power in Ireland up to 2030 so that we can deal with the effects and reduce our greenhouse gas emissions.  That is where the debate needs to move to.  We can all say that what is happening is terrible.  We need to move the discussion on.  We have identified a problem.  What are we going to do about it?  I notice that other Bills belonging to other people do get coverage.<\/p><p>However, a number of the environmental Bills that I introduced did not see the light of day in the mainstream print or electronic media.  The witnesses might respond to that point, given that they have said that RT&Eacute;'s coverage depends on legislative action, what is happening in the Oireachtas and what the political parties are doing.  We can account for ourselves in this regard and have done a substantial amount of work that has never been covered by anyone regardless of our significant efforts.<\/p><p> I only saw parts of the waste programme because I arrived in late before being called out again.  It was good and I compliment RT&Eacute; on broadcasting it.  Doing so was a good idea, as people could relate to what they were doing themselves.  Doing the same in this context would be useful.  Waste is adding to greenhouse gas emissions, but our lifestyles mean we produce 60% to 70% more greenhouse gas emissions than the average European, so a similar highlighting of certain practices, for example, long commutes in Dublin, and what can be done about them would be good.  Does RT&Eacute; have plans in this regard?<\/p><p> My final question is on advertising.  Half of RT&Eacute;'s revenue comes from the licence fee, and rightly so, but it depends a great deal on commercial revenue.  Companies involved in practices and industries that are anything but climate friendly supply it with advertising material to broadcast.  From an ethical point of view, has RT&Eacute; a policy on this?  There could be a conflict.<\/p><p> Met &Eacute;ireann's communication of weather warnings is good and its forecasting has improved in recent years.  We are on the edge of the north Atlantic, which makes forecasting difficult.  I have often watched Ms Cusack trying to give people an honest picture.  I always find the forecast good.  People say it is not accurate, but they are not listening to it properly.  If they listened to the full forecast, they would find it to be accurate, particularly for those who work outdoors.<\/p><p> Met &Eacute;ireann has issued warnings about extreme weather events only for those events not to affect particular locations.  Just before Christmas, Dublin traders complained that because Met &Eacute;ireann had issued a red or orange alert that day and told people not to go outdoors, the shops were empty.  Forecasting can be difficult, but is there a need for further refinement on a regional basis?  Met &Eacute;ireann makes an effort to say where, for example, heavy rain, flooding or extreme winds are likely, but could it try to nuance its orange and red warnings?<\/p><p> Regarding attribution, a memo was cited.  I understand that Met &Eacute;ireann cannot say that an event was caused by global warming.  There are few certainties in reading the science involved, given that weather changes, but in terms of developing Met &Eacute;ireann's policy on what it communicates to the public, is it shifting in the direction of telling them that, for example, the four serious weather events in Ireland in the past 12 months were the effects of global warming?  I would appreciate brief answers to these questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2019011600002#X01000","speaker":"1232","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1547647200,"counter":57,"content":"<p>Regarding the Deputy's Bill-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2019011600002#Y00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jon Williams"},{"type":"speech","time":1547647200,"counter":58,"content":"<p>Bills.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2019011600002#Y00300","speaker":"1232"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1547647200,"counter":59,"content":"<p>Bills.

Regarding the latter, there are three phases to the developments in which we are engaging.  One is the scientific and technical development to improve the attribution so that we can understand and identify the climate change fingerprint that may or may not be present in any particular weather event or sequence of weather events.  This is a complex scientific task, as the atmosphere is chaotic, and it involves cutting-edge science in terms of mathematical simulations.  We are at the vanguard in that regard and working with leading scientists internationally.<\/p> <p>  The second phase is about turning that work into an operational service that will provide routine updates, perhaps on a seasonal basis or, depending on the scale of the relevant weather pattern, rapidly afterwards.  It depends on the type of weather pattern.  If it is a large heatwave or a drought scenario, it is more suitable for attribution studies whereas something that is highly energetic, such as a convective event, is more difficult to attribute in terms of hard science.<\/p> <p>  The key issue, which has already been touched on in this discussion, is the understanding of that information and its communication to the public.  When one communicates any item of information relating to weather or climate to the public, the two challenges are confusion and give mixed messages.  The main exercise in our research with colleagues in Europe is about ensuring a single, consistent and coherent approach so that just one message is provided using the very best attribution assessments of past weather events, be they recent or in the past season.  We are working on the matter the Deputy raised, namely, improving communication so that the public understands and gets the maximum impact of any information we are providing.  I will ask Mr. Walsh to discuss this matter shortly.<\/p> <p>  On weather forecasting, there has been a silent revolution in the accuracy of forecasts in recent times.

We have a sense that a whole-of-Government and whole-of-society approach will be required to deal with this most urgent issue facing humanity.  Both of the organisations represented here have an incredible responsibility in this.  First, they are trusted, particularly Met &Eacute;ireann because people tune in to hear its reports every day.   In an extreme weather event we are all glued watching Ms Evelyn Cusack and all the others who tell us that it is not safe to go out, and we trust them.  That is the reality.  We see Met &Eacute;ireann as being incredibly important in this.  I was amused at the part of RT&Eacute;'s opening statement stating \"A cursory review of coverage over the past six months on this issue demonstrates that RT&Eacute; is making genuine efforts\".  That period happens to coincide with the length of time this committee has been holding its hearings.  I wonder are they related?  Over the previous six years, I have been a little disappointed at RT&Eacute;'s balanced coverage, for instance, when planning issues were being discussed and the reasons people were considering renewable infrastructure.  Insufficient accurate information was sought to establish why in heaven's name we were doing this, because the climate was changing and we have responsibilities.  Therefore I welcome what RT&Eacute; said about looking at something along the lines of \"Operation Transformation\".  There is great merit in that because people will tune in if they are getting accurate information on this.  Will RT&Eacute; require funding from a specific Department to follow up on such a project?<\/p> <p>  As for its relationship with Met &Eacute;ireann, the representatives from RT&Eacute; should tell us if there is anything in the contract between the two that inhibits Met &Eacute;ireann from expanding on its remit to share information to citizens on climate action and climate change?  Does anything need to be reconsidered in this area?<\/p> <p>  I have been very interested in some recent broadcast scheduling that I have observed.  John Creedon made an excellent three-part documentary called \"Creedon's Weather: Four Seasons In One Day\".  While I looked forward to watching it, it was scheduled in August, on a Sunday at 6.30 p.m.  On most fine evenings I am out.  Very few people would be inside then.  I am curious as to why such as valuable programme would be scheduled at such a time.  I should note this was in 2014 and I appreciate it was before Ms Forbes's time, but I felt that more people should have seen it then.  It would have been incredibly helpful for the public's understanding.  <\/p> <p>  Met &Eacute;ireann presented to the Citizens' Assembly and will have noted the assembly's further recommendations, including the one to which I made specific reference earlier.  Did it take the opportunity to raise with RT&Eacute; the recommendation that further communication would be required to get the information out to the public?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2019011600002#AA00600","speaker":"1339"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1547647200,"counter":72,"content":"<p>Whosoever wishes to respond first may do so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2019011600002#AA00700","nonspeaker":"Chairman"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1547647200,"counter":73,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for her questions.

It has been a supporter of that programme from the early days.  As there are ways we can work with Departments to make programmes in that vein, we can certainly look at things like that. <br\/><br\/>The relationship with Met &Eacute;ireann is hugely important to us and is one that is evolving.

This is something that we are currently working on and the members will begin to see its outcomes.<br\/><br\/>We must be very mindful of weather forecasts and information around climate change.

That is what this is about.  There are three elements to this, as I have said already.  First, the science is in formation so we are working with the best international research networks and the leading centres in event attribution to put in place a reliable, consistent and authoritative system to be able to describe whether we can detect the fingerprint of climate change for any particular event.  That is what is happening.  Second, we also want to ensure that is an operational system in terms of science, so that is being built as well.  Third is the way we develop the understanding and how we communicate attribution information to the public, and this relates to what the Deputy was saying.  Attribution information is slightly different from the normal weather information that we get.  We all live in a straightforward deterministic world and we do not live in a probabilistic world.  We cannot deal with probabilities because that is no use to us in reality if we want to decide whether we will have a picnic or put our sandbags out.  Attribution provides us with likelihoods and percentages.  For example, we could say that it is more likely that a particular event such as an intense downpour is due to a warming world.  That is a general comment but to focus specifically on a particular event in that manner is quite powerful information and is a wonderful way of being able to communicate the impact of climate change to the public.<\/p> <p>  I am not aware of the specific interview the Deputy was referring to, but the general communication that we would provide on any particular event would be to describe the general modification that has taken place in the dynamics of the atmosphere due to climate change and then to relate that to a particular event in the way that Mr. Walsh has pointed out.  In the absence of any specific attribution study on a particular event, it is very difficult to say that the particular event in question was due to climate change.

We have had weather patterns before and they have occurred randomly, but with human-induced activities, such as injecting greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, we are loading the dice and the chances of particular extreme events are increasing everywhere.  In some cases we can say a particular event has been made 50%, 100% or 400% more likely, depending on the statistics and models.  It is more understandable to people that way.

There is confusion around the colour coding.  There is an RT&Eacute; remit and a broader remit for the State and its Departments.  People cannot properly differentiate between red, yellow or orange warnings and do not know what would be the proper behavioural response to them.  On the first day of the snow last year, everybody went to work despite there being a red warning.  There had been a change from orange to red but everybody was out doing what they do every day.  On the following day the warning continued to be red and nobody moved.  There was confusion around the proper behavioural response.  I know with weather patterns the situation is fluid and is based on the possible predictions.<\/p><p>Have we considered European norms in perhaps localising weather patterns or trying to integrate this with technology in a greater way?  Part of the problem is that if people overestimate a particular warning, they will underestimate the following one, even if it should be taken seriously.

The forecasting system underpinning that in terms of the numerical weather prediction modelling systems is based on the very best forecasting system worldwide.  It is the ECMWF forecasting system.

Part of the task of a weather forecaster is to try to provide information on what the weather may look like in the next five days, ten days, two-week period or even a month.  Sometimes one could look at a weather forecaster and decide that in actual fact he or she is predicting the predictability of the atmosphere, which is a chaotic system and is referred to as a dynamical system.  The predictive capability and skill that we have, which is increasing at pace scientifically, is remarkable now compared with the past ten years.  Every year we acquire another one day's predictive capability by using the very best forecasting capability in the world called an ensemble system.  I will not go into the technicalities of the system.  Suffice to say, instead of using one forecast we run 51 simultaneous forecasts on a super computer thus allowing us to capture the chaotic dynamical nature of the atmosphere, and all possible thermodynamic outcomes that could possibly occur in the next one to two weeks.  This work is subject to continual refinement and tuning to capture all possible outcomes.  The ECMWF model, which is the leading forecasting model in the world, is a leader in this area.<\/p> <p>  As we trend into the future and move into a warmer world the physics and dynamics of the atmosphere are going to change.  The nature of extreme weather is something that we are going to have to work on quantifying, and we refer to this as the future weather challenge.  Let us remember that there is a difference between climate and weather and I invoke the phrase that climate is what one expects and weather is what one gets.  This is because, as we move into the warmer world scenarios, in the coming decades, we will see the chaotic face of weather and atmospheric dynamics emerging in that period.  The science of meteorology and what we are learning from climate models are merging to encompass the capability, that we are learning from, climate models and forecasting models to improve our forecasting capability.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2019011600002#HH00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Eoin Moran"},{"type":"speech","time":1547647200,"counter":120,"content":"<p>It is true that RT&Eacute; did not have what the BBC had with the Nigel Lawson judgment.

It is probably not possible to answer the question but we all know there are changes.  Our weather is changing because of climate change but why is there such diversity in the change?  How come there is no consistency in the change?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2019011600002#JJ00400","speaker":"1383"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1547647200,"counter":125,"content":"<p>This is the $16 million question.  Largely speaking, when the atmosphere is warming, there is, on a very large scale, a fundamental change in the gradient between the tropics and the Arctic, to look at the hemisphere in a simplistic way.  One impact of that is it alters the dynamics of the upper part of the atmosphere, halfway up through the atmosphere to the jet stream.  The jet stream is normally kept in a strong, east to west zonal pattern but, when the gradient between the tropics and the Arctic is loosened or weakened, a lax or meandering pattern is created which can then produce this inconsistency in the weather.  One manifestation of this could be the fact that we are experiencing a polar solar stratospheric warming event at the moment, which is the second polar stratospheric warming event in the past ten months.  It is a manifestation of the same effect where the polar vortex is in a lax, meandering mode, producing the effects the northern hemisphere is experiencing at the moment.  This is producing an inconsistency, to use the language the Senator has chosen there.<\/p><p>I would be glad to discuss the issue with the Senator.

I was interested when she said RT&Eacute; had a 94% penetration rate, which is fantastic.  RT&Eacute; has fantastic access to the public.  She also went on to say there was no substitute for public information campaigns.  Millions were put into informing the public in the United Kingdom about our impact on the climate and the environment and Sir David Attenborough's programme \"The Blue Planet\" had more of an impact than anything that had gone before.  Is it time to look at the issue differently?  We are judged thoroughly in the court of public opinion, by populist opinion and especially by what comes out of the mouths of those regarded as popular.  I hate to use the word \"celebrity\".  Is there a better way to communicate with the general public to tell them what individuals could do differently to have an impact and make a difference in dealing with climate change?  Sir David Attenborough did that and we now all look differently at our use of plastics.

The hearings we are having today show a clear obsession with the weather.  If one follows that logically, the weather seems to be the mechanism by which one can communicate so much because Irish people are obsessed with it and one can use it as a tool with which to disseminate information to those who may not have a conceptional understanding of what climate change might be.  Therein lies an opportunity.<\/p> <p>  I am conscious that we cannot put too much of an onus on RT&Eacute;.  The organisation has such a wide remit and only collects so much from the broadcasting fee.  It would be easy for us to say RT&Eacute; needs to do more.  I note there is an audience council report from 2014 - I do not know whether there has been one subsequently - which showed clearly the need for greater messaging around climate change.  We must take in good faith what has been stated here today in respect of the various initiatives in which RT&Eacute; is involved through programming, through Science Foundation Ireland and in inculcating more stories through current affairs programmes such as \"Morning Ireland\".<\/p> <p>  The witnesses will correct me if I am misinterpreting the late Professor Marshall McLuhan's assertion that \"the medium is the message\".  I accept that the medium of television and the television schedule are limited.  I also accept the point made in respect of the weather slots and whether they present an opportunity to communicate a message.  I would contend that is probably not the case.  However, if Met &Eacute;ireann and RT&Eacute; are partnering through the RT&Eacute; Player, they have an infinite opportunity to message to countless numbers of people and therein lies the opportunity.  We are all now dependent on the player.  I cannot be at home at 9 p.m. or 10 a.m. but I can watch programmes afterwards.  The player is a major resource.<\/p> <p>  If we have meteorologists who are talking about the attributional effect - in that regard, we need to do more to use language that ordinary people can understand - and if we have Met &Eacute;ireann partnering with RT&Eacute; on the player to disseminate bespoke simple messages around the effects of weather patterns in three, four or five minute segments, it would become as popular as a YouTube clip.  There is no reason Met &Eacute;ireann could not use YouTube as a medium as well to get that message out.  We have an opportunity here.  This meeting has been informative.<\/p> <p>  My question arises from my lack of understanding of how Met &Eacute;ireann sees its remit.  While I understand the partnership with RT&Eacute; and the element of disseminating information, does Met &Eacute;ireann see its role as being an advocate for messaging around the dire impacts of climate change?  In its statement, Met &Eacute;ireann used the word \"unequivocal\" in relation to the evidence base that exists around climate change.  To take that one step further, does Met &Eacute;ireann see its role as being an interpreter of the science and a disseminator of a message in respect of that?  I sense some reticence - the witnesses will correct me if I am wrong - from Met &Eacute;ireann about its role.  I understand the partnership and the dynamic between Met &Eacute;ireann and RT&Eacute;.  We have all come to depend on the weather reports, which are part and parcel of our lives, but I sense some reticence on the part of Met &Eacute;ireann about where it sees itself in terms of the dissemination of the message to the wider populace.  I ask Mr. Moran to correct me if I am wrong.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2019011600002#LL00200","speaker":"1276"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1547647200,"counter":134,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Sherlock.  That was an excellent question.<\/p><p>When one works in Met &Eacute;ireann, one of the key elements is to understand where the line is drawn.  This is an issue when one is forecasting the weather.  Our job is - this is the language we use - to support impact based decision-making.  We are providing weather forecasts but it is to support the Deputy's decision-making, the public's decision-making, the decision-makers' decision-making.  We do not just issue a forecast and walk away from it.  It is important to understand what decisions a person makes, what thresholds affect him or her regarding weather, and to take those into consideration when we parcel the information and form our messages.  How we interact with the audience is then flavoured by our understanding of how one makes one's decisions.<\/p><p> The same approach applies to climate change.  We are supporting impact based decision-making on climate change and that involves understanding at a community level, at an individual level and at a societal level what the thresholds are, what will affect one's planning and what affects one's decision-making, and then packaging the information in a manner that meets the person's requirements.  Some of those packages must be specialised.  Some of them and this scientific information need to be transposed, as the Deputy stated quite rightly, into plain language.  I quote words that have been used here today - \"into the vernacular\".  It needs to be part of everyday life.  This is important.  This is part of our role as scientists to be able to provide an explanation in the language that everybody uses.<\/p><p> I am sorry if the Deputy detected reticence but the key point is us struggling to try to explain what we do.  Part of the purpose of our statement is to explain clearly what we do.  We provide climate information conscious of what that information is to be used for.  We have to maximise the impact and the usefulness of that information.  It is a considerable asset but we do not tell the recipient what to do with it.  As scientists, we should not cross that line.  That is an important line that should not be crossed but we should inform ourselves as to what impact the weather or climate will have on the recipient.<\/p><p> Deputy Sherlock raised the issue of attribution.  In terms of plain language, I agree \"attribution\" is not a great word and we will work on that.  However, in terms of the expectations that have arisen regarding attribution, part of what we will be doing is explaining yet again that the attribution is not a cure all.  It is a valuable source of information but the way it is communicated and the understanding of that information is complex in itself also.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2019011600002#LL00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Eoin Moran","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1547647200,"counter":136,"content":"<p>The key point on the attribution is that we are all policy-makers around this table and we are of a certain age range.

There is the causal link between weather patterns, the effects of climate change and the heating of the planet which is attributable to human behaviour.  If such link were more widely understood it could influence how they make decisions about such matters as how they consume energy and the type of car they drive.  Somewhere there is a role for Met &Eacute;ireann to link the two, for example, where the weather is changing as a result of planet heating that were we to do X it would have a bearing.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Heydon made the point about the daffodils in bloom in January.  We were going into the Christmas period at 12&deg;.  I asked people older than myself if they ever remembered Christmases of 12&deg; in their living memory.  The answer was \"No\".  These were people in their 70s.  That is not to say it has not happened in the past.  That is as a result of the heating of the planet.  It has to be, if the science is to be believed.

For the benefit of members, the audience council is overseen by the board of RT&Eacute;.  It is one of a number of councils under the auspices of the board.  The board puts out a call for voluntary members to be part of the council which in a given year fulfils a number of duties, as determined by the board.  It is important to say the council is not the only way we receive feedback from the public.  The report to which the Deputy referred was produced in 2014.  As far as I am aware, we have not used the audience council for something like it in recent times, but I will certainly check.  However, what we now have and may not have had in 2014 is much greater engagement with the public, members of which are quick and happy to engage via email.  We have an audience panel which we use regularly in considering topics such as editorial policy and various surveys.  We have used the panel to gauge what is important and what the audience would like to see more of on RT&Eacute;.  That is how we make temperature checks to assess what is relevant to the audience.  We also regularly have focus groups with our audience throughout the country.  That is where we hear from the public.

Met &Eacute;ireann has this superb resource, the trust of the public and yet it does not have the competency in communications to get the message across.  That concerns me.  Is this something that Met &Eacute;ireann could do?  Should the Government be resourcing Met &Eacute;ireann to enable it to communicate the message?  This could be the critical link.  This is what is missing.  Met &Eacute;ireann enjoys public trust, and has all the competencies and expertise in science, but all that knowledge is not being communicated to the public.<\/p> <p>  My second point is on attribution and impact-based decision making.   I wish to raise the precautionary principle.  What I am hearing from Mr. Moran's response is that Met &Eacute;ireann is taking a very conservative approach to climate change.  However, there is the mechanism of the precautionary principle.  I wonder whether Met &Eacute;ireann uses or could advance that principle?  We all recognise here that climate change is happening.  As Mr. S&eacute;amus Walsh stated, there is a recognition of global warming and of increasing greenhouse gas emissions.  It is critical that the message is coming across to the public.  My sense is that Mr. Moran's conservative approach is erring on the side of caution.  Could the precautionary principle be used to move the issue of messaging forward in a more proactive way in order that the listener and those dependent on Met &Eacute;ireann's message are forearmed by that message, thereby getting the warning?<\/p> <p>  I now have a question for Ms Forbes.  My interpretation of Ms Forbes's contribution is that climate change is so complex that RT&Eacute; had better not do anything and not take action.  As Senator Marshall suggested, which I would support 100%, RT&Eacute; as a service provider instead could be doing lots of little actions, small sized messaging on how the consumer can take action.  That can happen through a whole array of programmes.  For instance, if we want to decrease the amount of emissions going into the atmosphere, we can drive our cars more slowly.  That reduction in speed will have an immediate effect.  If one takes a glass of water from the tap, one does not need to buy plastic bottles of water that have been stored for indeterminate periods.<\/p> <p>  Can RT&Eacute; move away from the complexity and recognise the problem?  Can it grasp the nettle and embrace it and decide that as the service provider, it will start to use every opportunity to inform the public as to what actions they can start taking right away?  Instead of just talking, RT&Eacute; can show the way to take action.  Could that be done?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2019011600002#OO00400","speaker":"1385"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1547647200,"counter":150,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for her questions and her observations.  It is important to state that we are not sitting here and saying the issue is so complex that we are going to do nothing.  I really hope that idea has not come across, because that is not the intention at all.  In fact it is quite the opposite.  I think what I said was that some of the areas around emissions and carbon are complex subjects and we have to figure out how we can best get that message across to the public.<\/p><p>That is what we are working on right now.  Going back to the Senator's point about how we can get actions out to the public, I mentioned that on Monday evening there was a very practical segment on \"Claire Byrne Live\".  There were four contributors talking about how to reduce waste.  They all gave examples.  That is just one example from Monday night just gone.  We are making much bigger efforts in that space but to go back to the point I raised earlier, there needs to be clarity.  We all need to be better informed.  We need to know that doing X will result in Y.  That is where more discussion is needed.  What is the message we want to get out there?  What are the five things that we can do as a society that will make an impact?  How do we communicate that?  That is the piece that is missing at the moment.  <\/p><p> We all have some bits of information.  We know that, as the Senator says, by driving more slowly we can reduce emissions but that is only one topic.  There is a lot of talk among kids about animals and what is happening to their habitats.  We need clarity around actions we can take to make an impact.  We can then get behind them and communicate them.  That is where there is a gap at the moment.  That is what we are hearing from our viewers and listeners.  They are asking to be told what they can do.  When we put out programmes around waste management or like that segment on \"Claire Byrne Live\" we get a huge reaction.

Our key communication goal is for the public and for those who are attending to have a real understanding of the weather that can achieve a personal attachment to how climate is changing and how it is expected to change.  That is a very powerful message and a very powerful communication goal to achieve.  That is the contribution we make.  It is a negative way to put it but the line stops at climate information.  We have a very significant role to play there.  This is part of a structured national climate change communications strategy.  It has to be part of that approach.<\/p><p>It is co-ordinated very ably by the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment.  On the question that Senator Grace O'Sullivan had on the scientific approach we take, that can be described as providing the very best explanation out of the set of all competing explanations.  In a loose way, that is a description of how the science of meteorology and climatology works.  Largely speaking, it focuses on the consilience of evidence to arrive at the most reasonable explanation, the best competing explanation possible.  Broadly speaking, I would not see this as a precautionary principle.  It is identifying the most plausible and best explanation.  I hope that answers that question.  <\/p><p> On communication, again I am repeating myself a little bit.  It is analogous to the way that we provide weather forecasts.  We do that by having an authoritative voice and a trusted familiar source, and that is greatly enabled by our colleagues in RT&Eacute;.  We then provide timely, accurate, actionable information that is understandable so that people can take actions.  We do not tell people what actions they should take but we design the information so that it will actually provoke the action and then lead to the best societal outcomes.  That is analogous to how we are moving towards communicating climate change.  We are working on providing the most relevant, salient, understandable climate information to support the wider climate action agenda.  That is again, quite rightly and ably, being co-ordinated and driven by the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment.  I hope that I have answered all of those questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2019011600002#PP00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Eoin Moran","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1547647200,"counter":156,"content":"<p>Mr. Moran has answered very comprehensively.

Macra na Feirme welcomes the opportunity to present the views of young trained farmers on this complex issue of climate change and to provide our perspective on the recommendations made by the Citizens' Assembly to the Joint Committee on Climate Action.  I am the national president of Macra na Feirme.  I am joined here today by Mr. Derrie Dillon, Macra na Feirme's agricultural affairs manager. This year Macra na Feirme celebrates 75 years of representing, supporting and developing young farmers to help them overcome the challenges they and their communities face.  Environment and climate change are a challenge but are also an opportunity, and young farmers are willing to play their part by embracing new science, technologies and management practices that will help make us climate leaders.<\/p> <p>  Today young farmers are establishing their businesses in the context of Ireland being a world leader in the area of sustainable auditing and carbon footprinting under the Origin Green programme.  The targets set out in both Food Harvest 2020 and Food Wise 2025 shape the future of agriculture in respect of production levels and the environment.  The multifunctional role and multiplier effect of farming means that along with the production of food, the EPA environment assessment in 2016 states that farmers and farming can provide valuable ecosystem services to society, such as safe clean water, regulation of nutrient cycles and enhancement of biodiversity.<\/p><p>When discussing agriculture's contribution to greenhouse gas emissions, it should be remembered that Ireland has a small cohort of heavy industrial contributors of greenhouse gases when compared to the rest of Europe.  This exaggerates agriculture&rsquo;s output of greenhouse gases relative to our European colleagues and is often used to portray the industry in a negative light.  Telling the full story on climate change is very important.  Irish dairy emissions, for example, are the lowest in the EU at just over 1 kg of carbon per kg of milk solids produced and our emissions are continually declining on units of food our farmers produce.  From a carbon credit perspective, agriculture does not always receive its fair share of credit.  Grassland, for example, is an acceptable carbon sink from a scientific point of view and recognised by the Food and Agriculture Organisation, FAO, but is not currently an accepted mode of carbon sequestration for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, IPCC.  Ireland is making decisions on greenhouse gas policy for agriculture in the absence of this key abatement resource. <\/p><p> Macra na Feirme appreciates the complexity of developing policies and strategies to address climate change.  The short timeframe in which the Citizens' Assembly considered and made recommendations on this critical issue is a cause for concern.  Time does not permit me to go through all of the recommendations of the Citizens' Assembly.  However, I would like to elaborate on recommendations Nos. 5 and 6.  Macra na Feirme has highlighted in its pre-budget submissions the need for action on developing positive policies on planning permission and REFIT tariffs for renewable energy.  These, along with financial tools, are required to help stimulate greater uptake of on-farm renewable energy projects including biogas from anaerobic digestion and the installation of solar panels on farm buildings.  To achieve greater investment in the sector, farmers who want to join together in collaborative projects should be facilitated to apply collectively under grant aid schemes to allow them to achieve economies of scale.  All feed sources for biomass production should be indigenous to encourage development of the supply chain.<\/p><p> On abatement measures at farm level, the Teagasc marginal abatement cost curve, MACC, includes a range of scientific advancements and measures around grassland management, the inclusion of clover in swards, nutrient management planning and sexed semen, to name just a few.  The three fundamental requirements for achieving the aforementioned measures are education and advice, policy and CAP supports to help gain traction among farmers.  According to Teagasc, widespread uptake of nutrient management planning could achieve a 10% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and a 15% reduction in ammonia emissions.  The key to unlocking this potential is understanding how farmers digest, use and process scientific information.  However, environmental sustainability cannot be taken in isolation.  It is also linked to farmers' economic sustainability and equally important is farmers' social and mental sustainability. <\/p><p> We are sometimes led to believe that emissions reduction can only be achieved by reducing farming activity.  This type of messaging is incorrect and must stop.  The farm advisory service and various schemes, including the knowledge transfer scheme, the beef data genomics programme, BDGP, and the targeted agricultural modernisation scheme, TAMS, have all helped to engage farmers in a positive way and have led to emissions reductions.  Education, training and innovative industry projects have also played a significant role.  Macra na Feirme's Young Farmer Skillnet, for example, runs a successful young beef farmer sustainability programme that focuses on many of the farm practices that contribute positively to addressing climate change. <\/p><p> Macra na Feirme disagrees with recommendation No. 11 of the Citizens' Assembly report on a carbon tax on Irish agriculture.  It would be a blunt, counterproductive instrument, which would divert output to places where carbon emissions and costs per unit of food are higher.  Climate change is a global issue and must be considered in such a context.  Irish agriculture is exploring and developing proactive approaches to decreasing climate change impacts such as feeding strategies that maximise the efficiency of grass-based production systems, ICT in agriculture to aid delivery of sustainable intensification, improvements to animal health and welfare, sustainable land management that contributes to climate change mitigation and sustainable management of soil and forest carbon sinks. <\/p><p> Regarding the reform of the CAP, Macra na Feirme favours a move towards a combination of results based and management based payments as part of environmental and climate measures.  Results-based payments have many advantages, including directly linking payments to outcomes, achieving more specific goals, creating a common goal between farmers and conservationists and providing coherence in policy instruments at national and European level.  Future CAP measures must focus more on outcomes rather than being input driven and they must reward productive and less greenhouse gas intensive farming.<\/p><p> Macra na Feirme has commissioned research into the development of a framework for continuing professional development, CPD, in the agriculture sector.  Upskilling and developing human capital on climate change in the sector could return significant dividends.  Also, from an industry perspective, a significant number of solutions are possible.  Encouraging further research into the manufacturing process of fertilisers, for example, could yield significant improvements similar to those possible with the use of protected urea.<\/p><p> Young farmers are the new environmentalists, reducing their carbon emission through a range of scientific, technological and management advancements per unit of food produced.  Most importantly, whatever route is chosen, young farmers need a just transition period.  Ensuring that farmers have adequate time and funding to reduce their emissions without sacrificing the rural population and rural economy is vital and should be the focus of this committee.  To that end, a tax on agricultural production would actively draw funds and resources from those who need to be supported to reduce their emissions intensity.  Support, engagement and encouragement of our farming community to address climate change will deliver greater dividends for the environment and the people that live in our communities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2019011600002#RR00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. James Healy","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1547647200,"counter":162,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Healy for his opening statement and now invite Deputy Deering to pose questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2019011600002#TT00200","nonspeaker":"Chairman"},{"type":"speech","time":1547647200,"counter":163,"content":"<p>I welcome the representatives from Macra na Feirme.

How should Macra na Feirme and similar organisations go about communicating the message on climate change within the sector?

We must ensure that the information that is available to farmers, which is plentiful and comes from a multitude of sources, is presented in a way that farmers can digest and understand.  A good example in the area of clean water is the asset programme that is currently under way.  Under that programme, 190 catchments have been chosen and various State bodies are coming together to consider possible sources of water pollution and are working with farmers on a one-to-one basis.  They are advising them and providing them with information but are presenting that information in an understandable fashion.  Farmers then have a choice as to whether to use that information.  I also referred earlier to our young beef farmers sustainability programme.  This is a 15-module programme delivered through Skillnet that has been running for the last two years.  Each year we have taken 15 of the best young beef farmers in the country and have tried to broaden their horizons and open their eyes to many of the advancements that are possible within the beef sector, including the genetic merit of herds, soil fertilisation, grass management and other measures that can play a positive role in reducing the carbon footprint of beef.  The Irish beef sector is the fifth lowest in Europe in terms of carbon intensity.

It has to be worthwhile for farmers, as well as for a community, which wants to go down the route of taking up the renewable energy challenge.  Wind farms are providing a return for those investing in them.  Several years ago, our national conference visited a farmer in Limerick who had set up two anaerobic digesters when there was a special grant available for investing in them.  He told us that if he did not have that grant in the initial stages, his anaerobic digesters would not have provided a return.  Considering this grant is no longer available and there is no adequate tariff for selling electricity back to the grid, anaerobic digesters will not provide a return on investment.<\/p> <p>  One recommendation from the Citizens&rsquo; Assembly concerns selling electricity back to the grid.  If there were an economic return from renewable energy, community-based projects would have a much stronger chance of succeeding rather than one-off investors.

Regarding the Common Agricultural Policy, the eco schemes related to the greening element of the payment are not very applicable to this country.  We would say there should be an advancement on the requirements within that element of the payment, but it needs to go down the road of being results-based rather than being a list of actions that a farmer needs to take.  Taking this from the point of view of climate action, we are the only country in the world that records carbon footprint on a farm-by-farm basis, which gives us a great starting point to show the improvement that can be made on individual farms.  If one tracks the initiatives being led in the IFA smart farming project that it does in conjunction with the EPA, it shows that major improvements can be made on farms.  From a Macra na Feirme point of view, therefore, whatever the scheme might be, it needs to be results-based and more targeted on the results we want to achieve.<\/p> <p>  To respond to the Deputy's second question, he referred to carbon tax.  That is just the carbon tax that is currently there.  As I mentioned, we need to support people to make the changes that need to be made in whatever section, be it residential or industry.  We need to ensure we do not prevent people from making the changes that need to be made to improve our greenhouse gas emissions.  From a farming point of view, this means a big carrot and a small stick, rather than a big stick and a small carrot.  When the Deputy mentions residential and rural communities, the same applies.  If we are to increase carbon taxes, we need to provide incentives.  This may go down the route of advice.  I know there was a lot of discussion on the last panel about communication with society.  More being put back into helping people to take the right steps and move in the right direction can only be seen as positive.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2019011600002#WW00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. James Healy"},{"type":"speech","time":1547647200,"counter":177,"content":"<p>I welcome the two members of Macra na Feirme.  There has been much comment in the committee, in particular earlier today, on the knowledge and the role of youth regarding this topic.  The idea of Macra na Feirme's membership is the youth of a sector that is very heavily involved in it.  It is a great advantage and very important to the committee that Macra na Feirme has come before it.  It is said that the best wine is kept until last.  The witnesses are the last contributors, and when we sit down to write a report, often what one hears last is what is most prominent in one's mind.<\/p> <p>  I have a few questions.  Macra na Feirme is a national organisation representing the agriculture sector but more so the youth and the younger generations.  Mr. Healy mentioned in his statement that we did not have an industrial revolution as such and that this perhaps exaggerates somewhat the percentage of agriculture's inputs to climate change.  I have read and heard this in every contribution that has been made by a farming body to both this committee and the agriculture committee but I do not think I have ever heard it or witnessed it being highlighted outside of this forum, this bubble.<\/p><p>Are farmers, farming bodies and farmer organisations communicating well enough with society in general?  I am not trying to portray a regime of making excuses, but I do not think the message, that is, the positives that have been done, is being communicated.  Mr. Healy made the point that we did not have an industrial revolution and that our agricultural emissions will therefore always constitute a higher percentage.  Other sectors point the finger at agriculture, and the agriculture sector then goes onto the back foot, into denial and into defence.  Could a better communication system within the sector be a start - as I said, not an excuse or a get-out - to working our way towards achieving a solution collectively?  With this in mind, Macra na Feirme represents the young, educated farmers.  Within this education system and the achievement of the green cert, is the scientific backup efficient?  Is there the knowledge within the agricultural education sector that needs to be passed on to young farmers when they receive their green certs when they are in that education system?  Is the scientific know-how there afterwards, be it in an advisory capacity or whatever else?  The solutions to these farming problems are through science.  Is the know-how and the technical backup for Macra na Feirme's young members available?<\/p><p> Macra represents the entire country.  Within discussions among its members, what kind of diversification is evident geographically?  What is ahead of a farmer in the Golden Vale and what is ahead of a farmer in the north west, north midlands or west are different.  They are two completely different planets, let alone two different sections of the country, and their problems and the potential solutions to those problems are miles apart.  How are Macra na Feirme's members interacting in this regard?  Is there unison or does the fellow in the north west, whenever forestry is mentioned, say he will not be the solution to the problems of the big dairy farmer in the Golden Vale?  Mr. Healy knows where I am coming from.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2019011600002#WW00300","speaker":"1383","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1547647200,"counter":179,"content":"<p>Mr. Healy may respond to those questions in any order he wishes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2019011600002#XX00200","nonspeaker":"Chairman"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1547647200,"counter":180,"content":"<p>Regarding communication, I would not like to cast any aspersions but I think all the farm organisations would accept we probably were behind the curve in getting our message across and ensuring we tell the full truth of agriculture's greenhouse gas emissions, whether the issue is production or whatever else.  As farm organisations, we probably were behind the curve when it came to ensuring that our message got out there.  We are improving on this.  I was listening to the radio earlier today, around lunchtime, and there was a discussion about climate change.  One of our members dialled in to the radio show and gave a very eloquent and understandable explanation of the farming side of things.  It is about making spokespersons and advocates of all our members, not just me or Mr. Dillon.  It must be all farmers.  Taking society as a whole, all young people, no matter what they choose to be, can advocate for the environment, animal welfare or clean water.  They can support whatever has taken their hearts as something they wish to do, whether over social media or through written or various other methods.  We as a farm organisation need to get ahead again and ensure that our members are armed with the information and the ability to get the farming message across.  This comes back to better use of all the technologies that are out there.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the green cert, and having gone through the process myself only recently, the content is certainly there and contained within it.  Moreover, there has been a recent curriculum change to advance it even further.<\/p><p>The people educating our young farmers in our Teagasc colleges certainly have a love of agriculture but they also have an understanding of where it is going, the challenges facing it and the message they need to get across to our young farmers and what they need to instil in them.<\/p><p> I could not speak on the need for advisers on the ground once one leaves agricultural college but any of the Teagasc staff that Mr. Dillon or I interact with have much scientific knowledge, be it the animal specialists, fertiliser specialists or any of the sector specialists.

Some of the divergence that has been mentioned between various parts of the country has come up in those consultations but young farmers in the eastern part of the country in particular have more of an understanding than those in other parts of the country such as the parts of the north west and parts of Cork that have a large number of trees planted that we need a more unified farming industry because, for example, dairy farmers cannot survive without beef farmers to rear their calves and they need tillage farmers to grow the grain that will feed their cows.  The same goes for beef farmers and all farmers.  All sectors need each other and there is more of an understanding there among young farmers on what could be considered the better land in the country that we cannot expect one area of the country to carry all of the weight when it comes to climate change.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2019011600002#XX00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. James Healy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1547647200,"counter":182,"content":"<p>I thank Macra na Feirme for its contribution.

It would be false to say however, that nothing is being done at the moment.  By way of comparison with the national mitigation action plan, the carbon emissions from agriculture peaked in 1998 and have been decreasing since until quite recently.  When the quota was removed in particular, it started to go in the other direction but that has coincided with a recognition that steps need to be taken to improve the situation.

I saw earlier in the week that the value of Irish exports fell back in 2018 but that was almost solely based on the fact the foreign exchange rates led to a fall in the value of the Irish product which reversed the trend in the value of Irish exports.  Much of the work in hitting the Food Wise 2025 targets will come from adding value to the produce, whether that is dairy, beef or tillage, and making sure that we are selling to export markets that put a premium on Irish produce.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2019011600002#YY00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. James Healy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1547647200,"counter":185,"content":"<p>I totally agreed with the contribution on renewable energy, that makes perfect sense.

Lime is a fertiliser that allows for better utilisation of all the other fertilisers, minerals and elements that are in the soil.  That trend has reversed through an intense focus on the scientific value and the soil value for spreading lime so that instead of 10%, we now have 30% of soils at the correct pH for grass growth.  We will not be able to cover all of these abatement improvements at the same time but it is about picking the low hanging fruit and the ones that will get us the greatest improvement in the shortest amount of time and putting a similar focus on those as we have done with the spreading of lime over recent years.  That is how we create that culture change among farmers which is needed to get them to avail of those scientific advances.<\/p> <p>  Incentives could be put in place to take advantage of some of those.  We have made a proposal on sexed semen in our pre-budget submission.  Sexed semen is more expensive than conventional semen but if the use of same were incentivised in agriculture, it would mean that fewer cattle would have to be bred for dairy farmers to produce the replacement heifers they would need for their dairy herds.  They would have to breed fewer animals and the other animals could be bred as bulls for the beef industry.  It would amount to more efficient use of the animals that are already there.<\/p><p>Given last year's drought, we have probably seen a slight tail-off in the increase in animal numbers.

This has to be where we are going and for farming it is the only future.  It is the only really viable future not just because we all rely on the environment, particularly farmers, but because of the prospect of reducing costs.  It is about the prospect of having more diverse income streams, not just from a variety of crops and food income streams, which is one of the directions we need to go in, but also from agriforestry and tourism.  I see it from the point of view of training a new generation of farmers coming in.  Designing the new CAP around diverse and higher farming income and more environmentally sustainable farming is the only future for Irish farming.  To be perfectly honest, the current system does not deliver.  Do the witnesses believe the current system is working for young Irish farmers?  There is terrible fear and people are told not to listen to the Green Party and not to change Irish farming, as if it is great, but only 7% of Irish farmers are under 35.

The most recent CAP, which provided a top-up for young farmers, was certainly a step in the right direction but there are more challenges than what is coming through the CAP.  To be fair, in this country a value is definitely placed on young farmers and creating generational change.  The biggest challenge that faces many young farmers is access to land.  As Mr. Dillon mentioned, we have a huge cohort of farmers in their 60s, 70s and 80s who have known nothing else.  There is a fear that if they hand over the farm, whether to a son, nephew, daughter, niece or complete stranger, they have nothing left and no security for themselves.  As Mr. Dillon mentioned, there is a fear of change and the unknown.  A step we have taken in this direction is the land mobility service.  Older farmers who put themselves forward as people who want to take a step back or retire are matched with a suitable younger farmer with whom they can farm in partnership, lease the farm or work together.  It creates a link, trust and transition.  This is one measure we have taken to try to address access to land, which is the main issue for young farmers.  The CAP has gone some way to helping.  Something we have proposed for the next CAP is support for schemes such as this, which helped create the transition.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2019011600002#BBB00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. James Healy"},{"type":"speech","time":1547647200,"counter":206,"content":"<p>I agree fully with Mr. Healy.  It is exactly the type of scheme and initiative we need to open up access to land and provide securities and other mechanisms to do so.  John Gummer, Lord Deben, the former UK environment Minister, now chairman of its climate committee, and farmer speaks very authoritatively on farming.  It is interesting to listen to him.<\/p><p>He said the UK opted for an industrialised, intensive farming system and is now rapidly retreating, not just because it realises that system does not work in terms of profitability.  The banks and everyone else benefit but the farmer does not in the end.  The farmers end up indentured to a very intensive system.  The soil and environment are shot and the UK actually has to go back to where we are, which is to smaller, family-based, less-intensive farms.  It is similar in New Zealand.  It opted for mass intensification.  It has land very similar to ours and has some similar social characteristics.  It is rapidly retreating because its water is gone.<\/p><p> Reference was made to what we value.  When I listen to Teagasc and, I hate to say, the farming organisations, and certainly the Department and the Minister, I realise they are all about intensification and rapidly trying to get to where England is and where New Zealand went.  I am pulling my hair out in the belief we should not do this because those countries are coming back towards us.  Why would we not stay where we are?<\/p><p> Let me outline why I asked whether the system is working.  We have to look at this from a rural development perspective.  I have always believed Macra na Feirme recognises the importance of community, getting farmers working together in a parish, working collectively and having a rural community.  Not only is the intensification model destroying the water, wrecking the soil and creating a system of indentured farming that is good for big business but not for the small Irish family farm but it is also failing to protect rural communities.  While we need to give young farmers access to land, do we not need to go a little further and shift away from the concept of achieving growth at all costs and having ever-greater intensification, which is all about the processors doing well and big industrial plcs calling all the shots and running things, which is where we are going.  I do not want to name names here but we all know who we are talking about.  Does Macra na Feirme, as a community organisation, not believe the shift needs to happen?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2019011600002#BBB00700","speaker":"1294","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1547647200,"counter":208,"content":"<p>May I address the first question and lead on to the second?  The change in the farming demographic is much greater in dairy farming because it is a profitable sector.  I mentioned earlier creating greater value for the produce Irish farmers produce.  The beef sector might be producing a slim profit but, more than likely, 90% of beef farmers in Ireland are depending on the single farm payment to live.  The tillage sector has been reasonably good this year but has experienced much lower yields because of the conditions last year.  With regard to the horticulture sector, I cannot imagine what it would be like to see a kilogram of my carrots that I put my heart and soul into producing being sold for 49 cent in a shop.  We need to place more value on the food we are producing.  It is important that there be a secure food source for the populations of Ireland and the rest of Europe, which is why the Common Agricultural Policy exists, but we need to realise that, in 1970, consumers were spending 30% of their income on food and that this proportion is now down to 10%.  This is with much improved production processes, improvements to animal welfare, etc.  Scale is important for some farmers because it is the only way they can make a full-time living.<\/p> <p>  In our organisation, we ask whether a farmer with 100 cows would be better off with that number and operating extremely well, perhaps working alone, which might involve a small bit of labour from time to time, or whether he would be better off with 200, thus having to bring in extra labour and all that comes with it.  We are examining this.  This relates to the question the Deputy asked.  We certainly value the Irish family farm model but we must ask whether the Irish farmer is getting the correct reward for this.<\/p> <p>  With regard to climate action, 40% of the carbon attributed to food production, depending on the product, is associated with the waste of the product.<\/p><p>One could eliminate this.  I am not a science expert, but the figure is based on a study carried out by a Dutch university that Mr. Dillon and I saw when in Brussels.

We cannot opt for a Food Wise strategy that sees an increase in emissions, which is where we are going.  Environmentally, that is not on; we have to cut our emissions.  Even with all of the changes concerning ammonia, urea and lime, Teagasc is still projecting increases in emissions.  This has to change.  In making the change the environmentalists are the delegates' best ally because there are no better people to say it is wrong that carrots are being sold for 49 cent per kilogramme and to help to create a culture in which farmers have a better income in an environment in which we are reducing our emissions.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Deering asked about the carbon tax.  We have to be careful not to mix up the taxes.  There is a carbon tax on the general economy, which is currently &euro;20 per tonne, but that is a separate issue.  As we raise that tax, I grant absolutely that we have to look after rural areas by retrofitting rural houses first and investing in public transport for rural areas and so on, but I understood the tax Professor Alan Matthews was considering in his presentation to the Citizens' Assembly was much more specific.  It is a tax on the consumption of meat and cheese.  I envisage great benefits in reducing waste and it would not be the farmer who would take the cut but the retailers, processors and consumers.  If we could be certain that the carbon tax on the consumption of meat and dairy would not be taken from the farmers' share which needs to rise and that the revenue generated would go back into farm incomes, resulting in a net gain for the farming community, as proposed by Professor Matthews, and if we could devise a mechanism whereby the power relations in Irish agriculture changed in order that the farmer would not just be the price-taker taking the hit, would it not help rural development and farming?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2019011600002#DDD00200","speaker":"1294"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1547647200,"counter":211,"content":"<p>The Deputy has put me on the spot.

It was very useful.  Mr. Healy will remember that when Professor Sweeney was asked the question, he said every country, no matter how efficient,had to face up to the scale of the change required and the challenges posed in that regard.<\/p><p>Countries such as Argentina, Brazil and Australia will burn in a climate change world.

That was mentioned by the witnesses.  In Northern Ireland there has been an incredible boom in pig numbers.  They now have enough pigs to provide sewage equivalent to that from 12 million people.  That is the level of industrial output that is planned in that sector.  The anaerobic digestion systems come from America where there is an indentured agricultural system with the poor farmer who has a pig lot being on a minimal margin and often in a very precarious position.  If there is an outbreak of flu or anything else happens, the pig farmers are the ones who get hit.  Even though anaerobic digestion is green in the sense that one gets an energy crop, there are digestive problems and water problems.  In parts of the North we are seeing the water and other systems being trashed under the guise of doing a good or green thing.<\/p><p> I fear that UCC, Teagasc and others are pitching this here as part of a more industrial expansionary approach to agriculture.  They are putting a green label on it by saying anaerobic digestion is attached to it.  I would love to see local farmers coming together on a collaborative basis, but I fear it would end up as big industry.  Farmers would plough material into a big processing system that is the furthest from green.  I wanted to flag that issue.  We need to do research on that before we leap into an expansion of anaerobic digestion.  It could be sold as a green thing but it would be an industrial farming system in the guise of a green approach from which farmers would not necessarily benefit.<\/p><p> We should encourage more research on carbon tax to guarantee protection for the farming community.

The emissions sequestration must be accounted for in our 2030 EU non-traded sector targets as part of the EU nationally determined contribution to the Paris Agreement.  I would welcome a comment from him on that point.  The committee has heard from a range of sources about the importance of farmers getting the right incentives to reduce emissions.

If farmers were able to sell electricity back into the grid, it would provide some opportunity for diversification.  The credit for the reduction in carbon emissions would go to the energy sector as opposed to agriculture.  I do not know enough about the situation in New Zealand to give a good response but the situation should be examined to ensure that agriculture receives the credit it deserves for any improvements that are made by farmers or the industry.<\/p> <p>  In terms of results-based schemes, we are the only country in the world that is measuring the carbon footprint of farms with the carbon navigator.  That provides a fantastic basis for a results-based scheme where a benchmark can be set and the improvement coming from the steps a farmer has taken can be seen.  That comes back to including farmers in the design of schemes.  A Pillar 2 or rural development programme scheme that has been a great success is the Burren Beo scheme.  Farmers were involved in the development of the scheme and their knowledge and experience was acknowledged, but the scheme also achieves the results.  Benefits are provided for the farmer but the scheme also provides the benefits that were sought in other areas.

I have listened to the questions asked by other members and I heard an interesting point Mr. Healy made that was not picked up.  I can see where he is coming from.<\/p><p>Outside of transport, agriculture seems to be the next sector hit in this country for carbon and climactic change issues.  We are considered a non-industrialised nation.  Britain had an industrial revolution in the 1800s and 1900s and there was growth in the likes of Germany.  Are we now in a situation, as a country, whereby we have to carry an extra burden to clean up the damage that has been caused?  Do we actually carry a heavier burden in cleaning up the air for the sake of other countries that created the problem, and continue to do so?  That is a good point.<\/p><p> We are going down the road of imposing further conditions on farming practices and so forth.  Are we being the extra good boys again in the EU family compared to the Dutch, Danish or French farmers?  Are we once again leading the pack in putting in stringent conditions about going forward in our farming practices?  That is where we are at the moment.  Bigger penalties are coming on to us straightaway, when other countries might not be carrying out the same guidelines as regards climactic change.<\/p><p> Would the witnesses further comment on their views on anaerobic digesters?  I ask for further comment because I was disappointed to hear Deputy &Eacute;amon Ryan does not think they were a good solution for creating green energy.  He is saying they are going to create more damage.  My understanding about anaerobic digesters was that they were there to reduce the spillage of liquid manure into lands and produce green energy.  I ask for further comment on that.  Are the witnesses happy with the Government's plan?  I know from people going abroad that, in Germany for example, nearly every farmer has his own anaerobic digester, no matter what size the farm.  Half of those farmers' work day was keeping the thing going.  I asked the former Minister, Deputy Naughten, what was his plan for Ireland and he said, in the grand system, it would not be viable to put an anaerobic digester in every farmer's yard.  That is why the current Government has proposed regionalisation for anaerobic digestion.  I do not know is it every parish or what catchment area applies.  Is Macra na Feirme happy enough with the general policy as to the delivery of these projects?<\/p><p> Everyone is telling us what to do.  The Chairman should also be aware that climate change means the climate is changing in the seasons.  Should we not be reviewing practices as well?  We had to wait until last Sunday before the tractor and tank could go back out in the field.  Should we go back to the situation of giving trust back to the farmer?  There was livestock out around me on Christmas Day because the grass was growing.  Should we go back and let the farmers, who were the keepers of the land, know how to practice proper farming and are there any areas we should be reviewing?<\/p><p> We spoke about young farmers getting involved and taking over land.  What incentives would Macra na Feirme propose for older people?  We do not want to push them off the land.  There was a farm retirement scheme at one stage and I do not think it was attractive from a monetary point of view.  I do not know if it worked.  There are 50 year old farmers whose fathers are still the bosses on the farm, or if not the bosses, the deeds in the solicitor's office are in the father's name.  I thank the witnesses for their time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2019011600002#FFF00500","speaker":"1278","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1547647200,"counter":226,"content":"<p>The same targets are in place for every country and agriculture has to face the targets that are ahead of it.<\/p><p>We need to recognise that agriculture is sometimes unfairly tarnished in Ireland, relative to other European countries, and people do not understand the full story as to why in France or Germany, or elsewhere in mainland Europe, agriculture may only be 10% of the carbon emissions when it is 33% or 35% here.  The targets are there, the percentage is the same and, because of the size of our industry, those targets are probably fair enough.  We certainly need to get across the message that Ireland is not an agricultural carbon blackguard just because it is at 33%.  We need to ensure that society at large understands the full context of the situation.<\/p><p> Deputy &Eacute;amon Ryan mentioned the point where anaerobic digesters have capacity far above and beyond what could possibly be used by the anaerobic digesters that are there and that is a situation we do not want.  We do not want to have enough for 12 million people in an area with a population of 1.5 million or 2 million.  That seems a step beyond what is required.  Anaerobic digesters certainly have a role to play even in the positive impact they can have from an agricultural slurry point of view.  They make the nitrogen in the effluent more usable and available for the soil afterwards.  That is a positive I had not mentioned earlier.  Irish farms do not have the scale to have an anaerobic digester on every farm but certainly, as we mentioned in our presentation, community based schemes and the set up of co-operatives within communities to allow them to share in the benefits of having an anaerobic digester in an area may help to overcome some of the planning objections and give the local community a sense of ownership of the project.  Once there is a refit tariff that makes it economically viable for the farmer, it can be beneficial to all.<\/p><p> I agree with what was said about the issue of calendar farming.  We had super weeks at the start of January but we could not spread slurry and maybe we need to change.  There is a reason for calendar farming in that the scientific evidence shows that slurry does not need to be spread when the grass is not growing but, if the grass is growing at the end of December and the start of January, maybe we should be able to spread then.  By the same token, if the scientific evidence shows that, if there is a cold spell at the beginning of March, as there was last year, then we can swap the three weeks of spreading in December and January because the grass was growing and agree not to spread in the three weeks of sub-zero temperatures in March.  The scientific evidence is there to show that it will not be a positive for our water quality if we are spreading slurry at unsuitable times of the year but we can use that same scientific basis to have a bit of flexibility within the system to allow farmers spread more responsibly.<\/p><p> The farm retirement scheme worked for the number of years that it was in place.  There was a considerable change in the average age of farmers and in the age of farmers who were actually farming the farm.  A scheme that expected farmers to retire at the age of 55 was probably not going to work in the long term.  From the point of view of Macra na Feirme, something that is coming out of our consultations on the next Common Agricultural Policy at the moment is a retirement scheme, not necessarily an early retirement scheme, but simply a retirement scheme that would provide some security for the older farmer once they have handed over the land and control of the farm to the younger farmer.<\/p><p>Certainly, that could be something positive to be included in the next Common Agricultural Policy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2019011600002#GGG00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. James Healy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1547647200,"counter":229,"content":"<p>To be fair to the older men, in other sectors we are extending the age limit.

While younger farmers are no less likely to be involved in a farm accident than older farmers, the fatality statistics show that if an older farmer is involved in a farm accident, he or she is much more likely to die.  It is probably a result of the fact that a farmer at 30, 35 or 45, has that extra yard of pace and extra half second of reaction time that he or she may not have when he or she hits 70, 75 or 80, and a situation that the farmer could have got himself or herself out of when young, he or she is not able to get himself out of anymore.  Just as the middle of the day is not a suitable time to have children on the farm, I know of no builder at 70 carrying a hod or laying blocks.  Farming is equally as manually intensive a profession as something like building.  They do not have to retire, but certainly they should have the option.  Farming, depending on the sector one is in, being more or less profitable, does not always give farmers the option of putting away a nice pension that they can rely on after the age of 65 or, as it will be by the time I get there, 70.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2019011600002#JJJ00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. James Healy"},{"type":"speech","time":1547647200,"counter":231,"content":"<p>One cannot teach an old dog new tricks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2019011600002#JJJ00400","speaker":"1278"},{"type":"speech","time":1547647200,"counter":232,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses, Mr. Healy and Mr. Dillon.

The board&rsquo;s remit is to design, build and equip the new children&rsquo;s hospital for the island of Ireland.  The proposed new children&rsquo;s hospital development is the most significant capital investment project ever undertaken in healthcare in Ireland, bringing together three children&rsquo;s hospitals in a modern custom-designed building to deliver the best care and treatments for Ireland&rsquo;s sickest children.<\/p> <p>  I was joined on the board by 11 other dedicated members with the collective skills and experience of major projects to deliver on the responsibility with which we were entrusted, namely, to build a world-class children&rsquo;s hospital on the site of St. James&rsquo;s campus.  The urgent need for a new children&rsquo;s hospital for the country has been recognised for decades.  Acknowledging the importance of the challenge ahead of us and the realisation that we were building a hospital that will care for sick children and their families for many generations to come, we set out a bold vision for the project.<\/p> <p>  The project aims to deliver one of the finest children&rsquo;s hospitals in the world and specifically a hospital that provides a truly supportive and therapeutic environment for children and their families.  It will also provide a safe and stimulating environment for staff, recognising the importance of wellness.  It will be a hospital sensitive to and positively enhancing of its urban setting and the quality of life of the local population.<\/p><p>Its layout, detailed design and construction quality will facilitate the optimum delivery of all aspects of leading current and developing clinical practice.  It will be a leading edge fully digital hospital.  It will be cost effective in terms of capital and whole-life costs, with sustainable solutions integrated into all stages of the project life cycle.  In that regard, we have targeted a Building Research Establishment environmental assessment method, BREEAM, rating of \"excellent\" and BER A3 standards.<\/p><p> On design team selection, with a clear vision for the project and an experienced executive team in place, the board put in place a structure and process for design team procurement, securing planning permission and the procurement of contractors to ensure the timely delivery of the new hospital, while working closely with St. James's Hospital in decanting buildings from the 12-acre site identified for the new children&rsquo;s hospital.  Following a comprehensive procurement process, we reached our first major milestone with the appointment of the design team in August 2014.  Thereafter, the design for planning was produced in a most expeditious manner.  A planning application was lodged in August 2015 and An Bord Plean&aacute;la granted planning permission in April 2016.  This represented the crossing of a major hurdle for the project in the light of the previous experience with the Mater site.  The decanting of buildings from the 12-acre site identified for the children's hospital commenced immediately and an enabling works contract focused on demolition commenced in July 2016.<\/p><p> Importantly, shortly after receipt of planning permission, the procurement process for contractors began in June 2016.  A procurement sub-group had earlier been established to define the most appropriate approach to contractor procurement.  The group included our board, HSE estates and members of the Government construction contracts committee.  Given the history of cost overruns and adversarial behaviour on public sector projects, it was decided to consider alternatives to the traditional form of tendering.  Reference was made to lessons learned and evolving best practice in the UK and internationally.  The universal challenge in all was to replace adversarial cultures with collaborative ones.  The construction of terminal 5 at Heathrow airport is held up as a prime example of collaborative working.  Prior to its construction, the British Airport Authority, BAA, conducted a two-year study in which every major UK construction project of over &euro;1 billion completed in the previous ten years was investigated.  The two main areas identified by the BAA as contributing to the general poor performance across all projects were a lack of collaboration among project partners and the clients' reluctance to assume responsibility for project risk.<\/p><p> The procurement model for the national children's hospital had to align with EU procurement rules and work closely with established government construction contract forms.  Following deliberations over several months, which included presentation of the proposed option to the Government construction contracts committee, the strategy group recommended a two-stage tender process for procurement of contractors.  This process was and remains the accepted best international practice for procurement of large-scale complex projects such as the children's hospital.  Among the clear and defined benefits of the two-stage approach are that it attracted the desired calibre and number of local and international contractors to bid competitively for the project and it enabled tendering to occur prior to the completion of full detailed drawings for phase B, meaning that phase A construction could start two years earlier than if a traditional procurement strategy was deployed, thus allowing the bulk of costs to be secured at 2016 levels, that is, when they were tendered.  It also facilitated early involvement by contractors in the design development process, with critical input on buildability, contractor and supply chain integration, risk management and innovation resulting in the completion of a fully integrated design.  Critically, prior to commitment of expenditure on the main building works there is now certainty on cost and programme, with client and contractor risks reduced or eliminated.  The programme includes delivery of a fully commissioned and quality assured building.  The two-stage tender process has and will continue to foster a collaborative culture, eliminating traditional adversarial and opportunistic behaviour.<\/p><p> Stage 1 of the two-stage tender process involved the works being bid oon on the basis of a preliminary design and an approximate itemised bill of quantities based on that design.  The contractors provided rates for all elements of the works.  Stage 2 included the designers and contractors working together to develop the design to completion.  The tendered rates were then applied to the final bill of quantities produced by our quantity surveyor.  The actual cost is determined by multiplying the final quantities by the tendered rates.  Where there is disagreement between our quantity surveyor &ndash; Linesight &ndash; and the contractors, it is resolved by the independent expert whose decision is binding on both parties.<\/p><p> Following our meeting in November 2018, the board made a recommendation to the HSE and the Department of Health that the works should proceed as set out in the agreed tender process and that BAM should be instructed to proceed with phase B, the main building works.<\/p><p> I will go through some of the detail on the cost but we can go into greater detail later on.  I will switch the two around in the sense that I will deal first with the construction costs at a high level.  The sum of &euro;570 million, which was included in the approval of the overall &euro;983 million in early 2017, increased by &euro;320 million up to &euro;890 million.  As I mentioned earlier, we had targeted savings of &euro;66 million.  At the end of the day we achieved &euro;20 million.  That added &euro;46 million to the project.  Statutory issues, such as fire regulations following the Grenfell fire and additional sprinklers, added &euro;27 million to the project.  Engagement with clinicians on the final design added a further &euro;21 million.  Between those three elements, &euro;94 million was added to the figure of &euro;570 million.  In essence, the result of the stage 2 process, that is, the design and development element, accounted for an additional &euro;94 million.  There were omissions in the design at tender stage that were brought into the final design during the design and development process at a cost of &euro;20 million.  The impact of the nine-month extension of the programme and the additional scope added &euro;90 million.  Then, as happens in construction contracts, there were additional claims from the contractors to reflect the changes in scope.  At the end of the day, through the intervention of the independent expert, they were settled and agreed at &euro;22 million, which takes us up to &euro;890 million.  We can go into greater detail on that later.  <\/p><p> As well as an increase in construction costs of &euro;320 million, there were additional costs of &euro;130 million.  These included &euro;50 million in VAT, additional costs on the satellite centres at Tallaght Hospital and Connolly hospital, staff, site supervision, design team, medical equipment and risk and contingency costs.  The final project cost is now &euro;1.433 billion, which is &euro;450 million higher than the figure of &euro;983 million approved by the Government in 2017.<\/p><p> Following the Government's approval of the investment decision, the phase B works and the main building works have now been instructed to BAM, with construction works of the main hospital on the St. James's Hospital campus to be completed in mid-2022.  Close to the end of my submission I address benchmarking.  In early 2014, the paediatric hospital board prepared a preliminary budget.  That is detailed on slide 11.  It showed project costs of &euro;800 million.  This was based on advice from AECOM, the quantity surveyors for the Mater children's hospital proposal.  The estimate included construction costs of &euro;2,500 per square metre, which was the appropriate cost at the time.  We were in a deep deflationary period at the time.  We allowed an inflation allowance of 3% per annum in accordance with the trend at the time.  In the AECOM estimate, which totalled &euro;800 million, there was an overall cost of &euro;2,875 per square metre.  An international benchmarking report completed by AECOM in October 2018 concludes that the average construction cost for an international hospital project similar to the national children's hospital is now &euro;5,951 per square metre, more than twice the estimated cost of construction in 2016.  Indeed, this is borne out by information from the industry on the decade up to 2022, which indicates that construction costs for large, complex projects in the Dublin area will have increased by up to 100%.<\/p><p> The cost per square metre for the children's hospital is &euro;6,500.<\/p><p>It is above the average of &euro;5,951 per sq. m but not above the maximum costs.<\/p><p> The timeline to deliver the new children's hospital from the appointment of the board in August 2013 to project completion in mid-2022 is a total of nine years.  I am satisfied that the board and executive team have set about the task in a competent and professional manner, putting in place the most appropriate structures and processes based on best international practice.  If we were to start again on a project of this scale and complexity we would adopt the same procurement approach.  Notwithstanding this we are deeply disappointed and acknowledge the very significant cost increases and the challenges these pose.  There are lessons to be learned regarding the wisdom of pursuing cost reductions on competitive tenders and ensuring the sufficiency of tender information, in particular, mechanical and electrical services at tender stage.  This would have ensured a more accurate prediction of actual quantities and costs at the tender stage and, to a large extent, would have reduced the under-estimation of costs at stage 1.<\/p><p> With cost and programme certainty now achieved, our focus is on ensuring that all parties work safely and collaboratively and deliver a hospital of outstanding quality in a project of which we all will be proud, namely, one of the finest children&rsquo;s hospitals in the world providing unsurpassed care for the nation&rsquo;s sick children for generations to come.  At the same time, we are mindful of the Government's concerns to ensure the project is indeed delivered within the agreed time and within the revised budget.  We welcome the planned independent review of board&rsquo;s processes and procedures.  Any issues identified will be dealt with speedily and comprehensively in the interests of successful completion of the project and the effective management of public funds.<\/p><p> I thank the members of the committee for their attention and my colleagues and I will be delighted to answer any questions they might have. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019011600002#H00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tom Costello","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1547629200,"counter":246,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Costello.  Will he explain why these overruns were not anticipated?  Was it a fault in procurement, tendering or both?  An expression of deep disappointment does not reflect the frustration and anger felt by this committee over what has happened.  We want to find out who was responsible for these failures as this is an unprecedented overrun in one of the largest infrastructural developments in Ireland.  The consequences of these overruns are not confined to the national children's hospital, but will have knock-on effects in all capital investment in our health service over coming years, including the National Maternity Hospital, the national forensic hospital, the National Rehabilitation Hospital, the building of elective-only hospitals as identified by Sl&aacute;intecare, the primary care programme and the replacement of equipment, which is necessary in all our hospitals, as well as the transitional funding that will be required to develop Sl&aacute;intecare reform.  It is not only a question of an overrun in the children's hospital, as it will be extremely damaging to all capital investment of the next few years.  Therefore, I would like Mr. Costello to answer why these overruns were not anticipated.<\/p> <p>  Second, what has the board identified as the premium for building the hospital at the St. James's site rather than a greenfield site?  There is obviously a huge cost in decanting buildings, as Mr. Costello described it, and demolition before construction was to take place.  <\/p> <p>  Third, why has the cost exceeded the international average and become the most expensive children's hospital in the world and one of the most expensive hospitals in the world?

It is likely that building costs will have increased by up to 100%.  We set out on a journey.  We had a deliberate approach in how we structured the project.<\/p><p>The two-stage tender process was internationally regarded as the best approach, whereby one goes to the market with a preliminary design and every element of the project identified but the quantities not finalised.  We went through the process and I earlier went through the advantages of going this route.  These are advantages which have accrued now and will in the future so that we are now at a stage whereby, through that process, we now have firm price and programme certainty.<\/p><p> I mentioned there were two issues in terms of lessons learned around seeking to get cost reductions when there was a competitive tender process.  In hindsight, there was pressure on the budget, mainly driven by tender price inflation, and pressure to reduce the costs.  People must remember that it is a huge project.  It is one of the most expensive hospitals in the world but it is also one of the biggest children's hospitals in the world.  It is important to remember that and because it is big, it is extraordinarily complex.  People might walk into a room and say a room is a room but the infrastructure behind the delivery of that room to deliver a fully digital hospital is absolutely enormous.  At the early stage of the design, the complexity of those services and the quantities involved were not fully recognised within the early stage tender.  That became clear as the design developed over 2018.<\/p><p> It is important to remember that the quantities that are now applied to the rates we got in 2016 are the quantities that are required to deliver the project.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019011600002#M00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tom Costello","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1547629200,"counter":249,"content":"<p>My question was why those were not anticipated.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019011600002#N00200","speaker":"1275"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1547629200,"counter":250,"content":"<p>It is a complex project.

Mr. Costello has spoken about the digital hospital.  This is the first public digital hospital in Ireland and that comes with cost impacts.  People might ask what is meant by a digital hospital.  It means that we no longer rely on paper records.  Everything is digitised.  We have electronic healthcare records so clinicians will use their iPads and tablets to connect with records.  Every piece of equipment requires an interface with the electronic healthcare records so everything is stored centrally.  That has an enormous impact for the design of the building to ensure there is resilience built into the hospital.  If the IT systems crashed the entire system would go down, whereas in the old days one might have lost a piece of paper.  In all the 6,000 rooms there are multiple data points for pieces of equipment and for staff to connect to, but each of those data points is replicated in case something goes down.  There is an A and a B.  They must go to a separate computer room rather than to the same computer room in case a computer room fails.  They also each need a separate power supply and back-up generator.  There is a huge amount of resilience and duplication in a digital hospital.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019011600002#N01000","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Pollock","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1547629200,"counter":259,"content":"<p>Why would that not have been anticipated in the original design, procurement and tendering?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019011600002#O00200","speaker":"1275"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1547629200,"counter":260,"content":"<p>The user engagement piece that we set out on day one in terms of getting on the site two years earlier than with our traditional procurement model was that we engaged with the users and we took typical rooms.

The highest cost of the hospitals was &euro;8,000 per square metre.  To answer your question on why it is more expensive, Dublin is an expensive place to build at present but it is mainly because, and I spoke earlier about the vision, we set out to build one of the finest children's hospitals in the world.  It is also one of the biggest children's hospitals in the world.  There are elements in it that cost money.  In terms of providing a truly supportive and therapeutic environment for children and their families, all 380 rooms are private rooms en suite with space for the parents to sleep.<\/p><p>That is a quantum shift from what we are doing now.

It costs more to put energy-efficient systems in the building we are constructing but that will yield huge savings during the life cycle of the building.

The original bid from BAM came in at about &euro;640 million.  When the dust has settled, I do not think we are going to see any change from much less than &euro;2 billion.  When this is all done, I think the overspending will be somewhere between &euro;1 billion and &euro;1.5 billion - and it could be higher.<\/p> <p>  The fiscal space for the entire country last year was less than a billion euro.  Think of the work, the analysis and the oversight involved in deploying that &euro;800 million, or so, while Mr. Costello and his team in St. James's Hospital were spending more than that.  As the Chair said, a Cabinet memo from December began to outline the costs of that.  What will not happen includes additional hospital beds, new emergency cancer and cardiac facilities, primary care facilities, long-term residential units, accommodation in the community for people with disability, new laboratories, new operating theatres, investment in paediatric blood services, the second catheterisation laboratory in Waterford, a new emergency department and cystic fibrosis facilities at Beaumont Hospital and no development of appraisals and early planning for Sl&aacute;intecare capacity projects until 2022 at least.  <\/p> <p>  That is the reality of the incompetence and failure that I think we are seeing from Mr. Costello and his board in respect of the financial control of this project.

What will be the total cost to the State by the time the doctors, nurses and children actually get to walk into this hospital?

Having looked through it in some detail, I think all sorts of costs have been left out.  I do not accept the rationale for the benchmarking that has been used, according to which the cost of &euro;2,500 per square metre four years ago now stands at &euro;5,500 per square metre.  The only explanation the witnesses seem to have given is that it somehow has become twice as expensive to build in Dublin.  However, the site cost has not gone up because the State owned the site.  Bricks have not become twice as expensive in three years and labour wages have not increased by 300% in the past four years.  I do not accept this increase.  When this project is finished, the cost per bed to the State will be twice the cost of the most expensive hospital ever built anywhere in the world.  How is it conceivable that the board is managing a project in which the Irish people will have to pay twice as much per bed as the most expensive hospital built anywhere in the world?<\/p> <p>  My second question on that relates to accountability.  If Mr. Costello was asked by a client to build a high-quality hotel that had to be cost-effective in terms of the capital used and he informed his client two years into the project that on the basis that inflation was high and he had underestimated the amount of bricks, wires, windows, beds and pipes needed, the client would have to pay twice as much for the new hotel as the most expensive hotel built anywhere in the world, he would be fired, his company would be taken off the contract and numerous court cases would be taken to find out what happened.  I am trying to understand how we will end up spending twice as much per bed as the most expensive hospital ever built.

We need to get the hospital built as fast as possible because of the additional need for isolation specific to paediatric healthcare.<\/p> <p>  To answer the Deputy's question on the number being added to the existing bed base within the three children's hospitals, as a total number there will be 68 more beds.  It is important, however, to break down that figure in order that it is understood.  It is not just about numbers, but about the types of beds we are trying to introduce.  The most important figure relates to inpatient and day cases, for which there will be 44 beds.  Within that there are new beds for mental health and for children with eating disorders, of which we currently have none.  Most important, we will also have 60 critical care beds.  This will be the largest critical care unit on the island of Ireland.  It will provide paediatric critical care for all of the sickest children in Ireland.  It will provide the cardiac critical care for the whole of Ireland's services, because we are now providing cardiac services on an all-island basis.  It will also have neonatal intensive care and critical care beds.  That is a fundamental change.  The greatest challenge for us in paediatrics is dealing with critical care needs and getting really sick children transferred from the regions quickly when they need to be transferred.<\/p><p>There also are the isolation requirements.<\/p><p> As for what is new, another 24 beds are based within the paediatric outpatient urgent care centres and in the emergency department as short-stay beds.  We have demonstrated and already put them into Tallaght Hospital and we started to do so at Temple Street this year.  I can report that for the children waiting for emergency care, our access for admissions in 2017 and 2018 has consistently reduced throughout the TrolleyGAR system because of these new ways of working.  This hospital will address the critical need for isolation facilities for paediatric care, which has a greater demand for such facilities than in adult services.  This year, we will open up the services at Connolly Hospital Blanchardstown.  By July, we will have opened an urgent care centre and outpatient unit at the hospital.  It will be the first time that there will be paediatric services in north County Dublin that will meet the vast majority of the requirements for that population.  We have major pressures in this area, particularly at the facility at Temple Street, because 124,000 children avail of our paediatric emergency care facilities and 48,000 of them make use of the smallest unit at Temple Street.  We anticipate that from this year, the investment that has been made in paediatrics will bear fruit and reduce some of the pressures being experienced at Connolly hospital.<\/p><p> We are dealing with a different way of working on the part of GPs.  As we have demonstrated, by having short-stay beds we do not need to admit as many patients as at present and consequently, the initiative should help to alleviate any bed capacity issues.  The initiative will be rolled out in Tallaght Hospital next year and then it will be rolled out in the hospitals.  We have a highly integrated phased approach to how we are going to transform services for children, particularly in the areas of general paediatrics, trauma orthopaedics, in which we have seen significant improvements due to the investment that has been made in paediatrics, and of course urgent and emergency care.  In line with the rest of the system and the Sl&aacute;intecare report, we are increasing the bed capacity but we are doing so in a very niche way.  It is not the same old, same old.  We are identifying and future-proofing where we anticipate the future healthcare requirements are.   <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019011600002#T00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Eil&iacute;sh Hardiman","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1547629200,"counter":340,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Hardiman for her comments.

I will speak to them twice because I understand they will also appear before the Committee of Public Accounts on 31 January.  This was a major topic of conversation over Christmas and the new year when politicians have time to reflect and talk to people at length.  This will be a case study for years to come.  It will affect future projects, as the Chairman outlined, and it will have a considerable impact on future capital projects in health.  I was a member of the Government that made the decision to build the new children's hospital and it was the right decision.  I was a Minister of State when the then T&aacute;naiste, Eamon Gilmore, and then Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny, allocated approximately &euro;450 million for the project and I was part of the Government that made the decision to go ahead with the project.  I would not have been part of a Government that would have made a decision to go ahead with a new children's hospital for &euro;1.7 billion because the impacts on other health capital projects would have been so dramatic.  We would have had to rescale and review the project and there is no way any Cabinet would have signed off on it in any way shape or form for anything near that figure or for even half of it.<\/p> <p>  I note the Taoiseach's recent comment, when answering questions about the hospital, that he had to choose his words carefully.  He indicated he believed the costs should have been anticipated and noted that this was the first time this model had been used to build something like this.  It was, he said, being done by a dedicated build board set up by legislation.<\/p><p>He said it was very disappointing that this had happened.  That must concern the delegates.  I believe the Taoiseach was being polite in his language because it was obvious to everybody in the Chamber and among the public that he was extremely annoyed.  As legislators, we are extremely annoyed.  Frankly - I am united with others in this - we will not stop until we get to the bottom of what happened.  We must learn from it, but we must also have accountability, given the scale of the overrun.  Members of the public are enraged and want to find out about the entire decision-making process.<\/p><p> Will the delegates remind us how the board is constituted?  On the reporting mechanism, I sensed that they were very uncomfortable with Deputy O'Reilly's second last set of questions.  Will they enlighten us on how the reporting mechanism works?

It is not apples and apples and oranges and oranges, it is a completely different jurisdiction so there is no best practice.  This is the first time ever and to be frank, we obviously have failed massively.  There are learnings here but best practice does not cut it.  The line that is being thrown out at political level to the effect that we are delivering the best children's hospital also does not cut it because the consequences for other capital plans and for people's health in this country are catastrophic.<\/p> <p>  I will come back on this but we need to get into the decision-making process to proceed with BAM based on the fact that it was so far under everyone else in its pricing and the escalation of costs that has resulted.  The &euro;983 million did not include ICT, electronic health records, EHR, family accommodation and a whole range of other things.  Politically, I am not sure how aware people were of this.  They were not aware of it in any way, shape or form.  When an announcement was made that &euro;650 million was to be spent on a hospital, that was seen as the cost of carrying out all of the work and cutting the ribbon and that is what people thought, including the witnesses.

The committee members have that.  Sharing that information is no problem.  With regard to how we deliver paediatric services, it is important to understand that the vast majority of the services we deliver are outpatient-based services and emergency and urgent care.  The committee will note that in the planning for this hospital we have seen significant increases in provision for outpatients.  We would have a total of 141 outpatient rooms.<\/p><p>They are spread between the outpatient centres in Connolly and Tallaght in addition to the new children's hospital.  The vast majority of services can and should be delivered in paediatrics on the same day through outpatient facilities.  Again, that reflects how we are moving, with Sl&aacute;intecare, to much more nurse-led and health and social care professional-led clinics, not just consultant-based clinics. <\/p><p> We have considered the activity and planning and projected the future requirements and we have mapped them into the particular rooms.  We can give the members a breakdown because the mapping is based on different specialties.  Let me give an example.  Some clinics usually involve once-off visits.  Some 25% of the population are children and because we are dealing with all those with the tertiary needs and those who require the high-end specialties, many have multiple appointments.  Sometimes they come to our hospitals and spend the whole day going between the various specialties.  The cystic fibrosis children take up the whole day in one room because we do not mix them with others for infection-control reasons.  Sometimes one child can take up a whole day in clinic.  The breakdown accounts for this.  The activity and planning analysis can map this.<\/p><p> It is important to note a children's hospital is different from an adult hospital and needs very many auxiliary supports.  We have facilities for parents to stay in the hospital close to the critical care, or what we call \"within dressing-gown distance\".  The mothers and fathers and other family members are with critically ill children and we need to support them.  This is different from other cases.<\/p><p> It is important to note that the hospital is to be the only one educating future healthcare professionals in paediatrics.  All the undergraduates in medicine and nursing and the health and social care professionals will be based there.  The hospital includes the education centres to facilitate this.  We have developed these with the universities.  All seven universities will have some association with the hospital.  That has to be taken into account.<\/p><p> One must consider the sheer volume of support required.  In our planning, we have prioritised to ensure that all the clinical requirements are met.  We have sought and optimised the support structure.  That was one of the benefits of being co-located on a large medical campus, namely, the 50-acre campus at St. James's.  We have managed to achieve some efficiencies in this regard through shared services.  We are utilising services that are for the whole of the campus and not just for the children's hospital.  We have actually built in capacity to take on the maternity hospital also.  All these factors need to be taken into account.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019011600002#DD01300","nonspeaker":"Ms Eil&iacute;sh Hardiman","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1547629200,"counter":480,"content":"<p>In fairness, trying to explain to the public that there are 6,000 rooms is the issue.

I welcome the witnesses and thank them for coming along this morning.<\/p> <p>  This project is an emotive project nationally among professionals and the general public.  Anybody who has spoken with the parents of sick children over the past 20 years will say always that there is a burning requirement for a modern hospital.  In fact, the argument and debate has taken place over the past 20 years with little progress.  I mention that as a backdrop to what we are talking about now.<\/p> <p>  Tendering, particularly in relation to inflation, is a sensitive issue at present.  It does not take too much inflation in a particular area to increase suddenly and dramatically the cost of a project.  There are one or two questions that I would put.<\/p> <p>  First, in the number of tenders received, will the witnesses remind me what was the difference between the lowest tender and the highest tender, and the extent to which the specification was observed in each?<\/p> <p>  Another question relates to the &euro;890 million plus the ancillaries that affect other locations and sites.  Is the cost likely to increase further under any of those headings and, if so, to what extent?  I refer to the &euro;1.4 billion eventual cost.  To what extent can the cost be retained at that?<\/p> <p>  It is &euro;890 million excluding VAT.  I thought there was a clause somewhere that VAT was not chargeable on some State projects.  How does that apply to this case?  If one is building local authority houses, it does not apply anyway.  Maybe we could get clarification.  How much would the VAT be?  I do not want to get a calculator.  It is not too difficult a job but it is a contributory factor.<\/p> <p>  Were the various bids in any way date conditioned?<\/p><p>In many cases it is usual to specify that a bid will last for a specified time and then there is a question of what it will cost after that time.<br\/><br\/>Is the project in accord with international norms regarding the specification for hospitals of different categories, A, B, or C, for instance?  I ask because if we want a state-of-the-art world-class hospital, and the parents of sick children want nothing less than a world-class hospital, then we must be careful not to dumb it down before it even starts and create a situation where we expect to get it for half price.  It will not work that way and we will not get what we are looking for, which is the highest possible standards of care for sick children in the future.<br\/><br\/>To what extent did the hospital's internal quantity surveyor and evaluation show any discrepancies?  Did a discussion take place <i>vis-&agrave;-vis <\/i>the various tenders?  Were they compared and if so, how?  Was it pointed out that tenders A, B, or C, had more or less than was required and so on?  <br\/><br\/>Was a request made or recognition given to the impact of inflation on various building works, whether it was in construction, electrical works or whatever and if so, what were they?  Were they marked as being of a particularly sensitive nature?  To what extent were they likely to change over a period of years?<br\/><br\/>How satisfied was the evaluation team that it was dealing with the best that could be done and that its efforts were not upstaged by any of the bodies involved seeking to increase the cost extent, scale or value of the project beyond what the board itself required?  <br\/><br\/>I am aware that since last July, the group has spent considerable time discussing what would be done next after it discovered the price overrun.  By what amount did it overrun in the period between July 2018 and November or December?  There definitely was an overrun during that period so was it wise to delay at that stage beyond acknowledging that there were cost increases in excess of what had been anticipated?<br\/><br\/>Were the cost levels anticipated at every level and potential increases identified at an early stage?  I refer especially to the lowest, middle and highest bids.

At that stage our board requested that the executive go back and look at alternative options for the project, conscious that we did not have to award the phase B works to BAM Ireland.  We had the option to tell BAM Ireland to complete the phase A works and go back out to the market so it did not have any entitlement to get the next phase of the project.  It was important for us to conclude the process to say definitively what the overall cost of the project was and in parallel with that, to look at what our other options were.<\/p> <p>  We looked at two other options, one of which was that we now had a totally completed design with all 6,000 rooms fully designed and detailed.  We had a fully detailed specification, bills of quantities and everything had now been itemised out so we could have gone back out to the market with that and re-tendered the project.  The issue with that was that it would cost a further &euro;300 million, additional to the &euro;1.4 billion we are reporting today and it would also delay the project by up to two years.  We looked at a traditional model of procurement in going back out to the market and we looked at a construction management model of going back out to the market which might have saved us some time but this had not been done under the public construction contracts and an increased risk would fall back to the client.  Having done that evaluation, it was clear that far and away the best option remained to award phase B to BAM Ireland, notwithstanding the cost challenge it poses.<\/p> <p>  The HSE carried out its review of that process as well as our internal review.  We met with the HSE and we presented to them over two days challenging whether that logic still held up but the clear recommendation was that it would delay the project further and it would cost more so the best option in procurement was to award phase B at that stage.  That was the decision our board made in November 2018 which was subsequently approved by Government in December.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019011600002#PP00100","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Pollock"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1547629200,"counter":512,"content":"<p>The Deputy asked about the difference between the lowest and the highest and that came to &euro;180 million.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019011600002#PP00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tom Costello"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1547629200,"counter":513,"content":"<p>To attract contractors to tender for this price we were conscious of the need to get Irish contractors and international contractors because there were a limited number of contractors in Ireland that could take on a job of this scale and we wanted to make sure that we maximised competition in the marketplace so we went to the UK to meet with contractors and present meet the buyer events there, encouraging them to tender for this project.  We shortlisted five companies to tender for it but notwithstanding that, in the end we only received four tenders.  The perception was that contractors would be falling over themselves for a project of this size but we only received four tenders.

It was reported across the water that Carillion was building the Midland Metropolitan Hospital in the UK and because the firm went bust, the project will overrun by an estimated &euro;300 million and be delayed by a further three years.  People do not fully understand that consumer price inflation is very different from construction tender inflation.  The Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland publishes on its website construction tender inflation figures on a half-yearly and yearly basis.<\/p> <p>  People say costs do not come down but they do at times.  In 2007, when the construction industry was running full steam ahead, the fall in tenders to 2010 was measured at 50%.  If a party bought a project in 2007 at &euro;100 million, in 2010 contractors would price it at &euro;50 million.  That is a major drop and people at that stage were trying to buy business and protect their organisations.  They were trying to use their balance sheet to trade.  They were looking to avoid adversarial claims in their approach to projects.  From approximately 2013 onwards, construction inflation started to rise at 3% and it has been trending now nationally at approximately 7%.  In Dublin it trends higher than that.

If we were in a deflationary cycle, as we were post 2007, it is likely we would have made a very different decision.  As I stated to Deputy O'Reilly earlier, the analysis that was done prior to making the recommendation to go ahead factored in all of this.  One could make the assumption described by the Chairman but there is an opt-out clause.  Contractors do not always behave well and if the contractor took a really aggressive approach towards us, we could find while working with the design team that there was no collaboration.  Our contract is based on that.  The right answer in such a scenario is not to go ahead with another phase.  Sometimes this depends on money and we are talking about that today because it is very important.  In order to achieve project certainty, having had it tough to get to this stage of cost and programme certainty, it is important that everybody on the team, including contractors, the client and those relaying the requirements of the Children's Hospital Group, accept that it is fully defined.  Everybody must work together to honour this.  There is a contractual risk and associated responsibility in any case.  People must genuinely work together to ensure we deliver the hospital to a high-quality standard.  In the delivery, everybody should come to work and go home safely in the evening.

The risk has been wholly costed in this and it is being borne by the taxpayer.  If this came in at the average price of a hospital, I would say it was fair enough.  A hospital is to be built and we would have agreed a price that is approximately how much it costs to build hospitals, so the risk would be with the contractor.  The reality is this will be the most expensive hospital built anywhere in the world.  Anybody in the country looking to build a house or extension, or who gets in a builder to do any work, can have a fixed-price contract that will put the risk on the contractor.<\/p><p>If they have been quoted by the contractor the highest price ever quoted anywhere in the world to do the work, clearly they are being hoodwinked and taken for fools if they think any of the risk, in a real sense, is with the contractor.  I just find it extraordinary that the board maintains we are going to have the most expensive hospital ever built anywhere on earth but that we are very clever because the risk of the construction costs is with the contractor.<\/p><p> Will the board release the various reports to the committee?  I would be very surprised if several of the figures we are discussing were like for like comparisons.  For example, the board's initial estimate was based on AECOM stating in 2014 that the cost would be &euro;2,500 per sq. m.  The size of the project is 160,000 sq. m, which gives a total construction cost of &euro;400 million.  I was a member of the finance committee when the national lottery was sold for &euro;400 million.  The conversation we had was that the &euro;400 million would pay for the national children's hospital because that was the estimated cost.  That is where is all started - at a figure of &euro;400 million.  If AECOM stated in 2014 that the cost would be &euro;2,500 per sq. m for a building 160,000 sq. m in size, that gave a figure of &euro;400 million.  The board's representatives have said inflation was factored in and it was.  If one factors in inflation at a rate of 3%, the figure moves from &euro;400 million to &euro;460 million.  AECOM's estimated price would have given us a total building cost of &euro;460 million in 2018, yet the board states AECOM gave it another report in 2018 that stated the cost was not, in fact, &euro;2,800 per sq. m but &euro;6,000.  Somehow, within a short period of four years, the estimated cost per square metre had jumped from &euro;2,800 to &euro;6,000.  I do not believe that and fundamentally do not accept that they are like for like comparisons.  The material, labour and professional services used on a project of this size are not all being sourced in Ireland.  They are international commodities.  There is no way the cost of bricks and mortar and the amount of money paid to sparkies, chippies and engineers doubled in a four year period.  I just do not accept that it did.<\/p><p> There is a second report from Linesight that conveniently states there has been 95% tender price inflation, which fits in quite neatly with the massive overruns we are discussing.  Two international benchmarking studies are also referenced, one of which I presume is the Linesight report.  Can the board release to the committee AECOM's work in 2014 that started with a figure of &euro;2,500 per sq. m, giving a total estimated cost of &euro;400 million, the 2018 figures - somehow the figure moved from &euro;2,500 per sq. m to &euro;6,000 - and the Linesight report that states there was 95% tender price inflation?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019011600002#TT01100","speaker":"1436","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1547629200,"counter":568,"content":"<p>We can.

Were the witnesses at those meetings making sure that the Minister was kept in the loop, kept informed, and that the concerns of the witnesses were shared with the most senior person within the health arena?  I think we all understand the structure, so there is no need to describe that.  Were the witnesses satisfied that their concerns about the cost overruns had been fully made known to the Minister and he was fully across it back in August?  As there were meetings on a weekly basis, I am sure that would have caused some concern.<\/p> <p>  A number of the questions I was going to ask have been covered already, so I will stick to the ones that have not been asked.  Who owns the land that the proposed children's research and innovation centre is being built on?  Who will own the building and how will the construction be paid for?  Is it to be paid for through some sort of philanthropic fund?  How is it envisaged that will be paid for?<\/p><p> My next question relates to the naming of the hospital and the concern regarding a memo brought to Cabinet which alluded to the naming rights being sold.  The Minister moved quickly to say that he would not sell the naming rights for the hospital but he did not say he would not sell the naming rights for individual areas within the hospital.  Does this feature in the board's plans?  Notwithstanding the opposition of other parties in the D&aacute;il, Sinn F&eacute;in believes there is good reason the hospital should be called the Kathleen Lynn hospital.  As in the case of many of our universities, is it intended to sell the naming rights for a particular area of research and so on and, if so, have any discussions in this regard taken place to date and do the witnesses have ballpark figures with regard to investment which they may be able to share with us?<\/p><p> With regard to the Crumlin children's hospital site, what are the plans for it?  Will it be available to the board?  I would like to return to an issue I raised earlier with regard to the additionality of beds.  Will beds in hospitals other than the three children's hospitals, for example, Limerick hospital, be closed on the basis of bed capacity at the new hospital?  Obviously, this would have an impact on the sum total of beds available for children.  Mr. Costello said in his opening statement that there are lessons to be learned in regard to the wisdom of pursuing cost reductions on competitive tenders and ensuring the sufficiency of tender information.  Will he identify those lessons, perhaps, in detailed follow-up correspondence?  Mr. Costello used the word \"disappointment\" in his opening statement.  I would use a much stronger word than that.  The lessons being learned are extremely expensive.  Has Mr. Costello communicated the lessons learned to the Department of Health and, if so, is he in a position to share that correspondence with us?  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019011600002#XX02400","speaker":"1302","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1547629200,"counter":647,"content":"<p>I will ask Ms Hardiman to respond to the Deputy's questions regarding the children's research and innovation centre, CRIC, the naming of the children's hospital and the additionality of beds.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019011600002#YY00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tom Costello"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1547629200,"counter":648,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for her questions.  It is important to speak to the broader health system.  From the get-go, the planning for this hospital has been a whole of Ireland approach.  There is a national model of care for paediatrics that underpins the policy position as to why we need to consolidate the high-end tertiary, quaternary requirements into one hospital and for it to be based in Dublin.  Through the HSE, we have been working with our colleagues across the system to ensure that we are planning in a collaborative way around children's health.  We have an integrated care programme for children, such that we engage not only with our colleagues in Cork, Limerick and Galway in the acute system but with colleagues in social care, community and mental health, which is important in terms of the experiences of First World countries with young people and mental health issues.  We have identified that there are services that could and should be done locally in the regional units.  The model of care maps the services that can be done in regional units and the services that can be done in local units and the required resourcing of them.  We have appointed a paediatric network lead, a surgeon, to work with the regional units on the appropriate utilisation of their beds.  This is about transforming children's health care.<\/p> <p>  The biggest transformation is around ambulatory services.  What we are putting out at Connolly Hospital and Tallaght Hospital is testing within the Irish system the feasibility of safely delivering outpatient, trauma, orthopaedic and urgent care in an efficient manner.<\/p><p>We would envision that in testing it in these units, it is something that the wider system could look at in terms of bed utilisation.  There is repatriation needed from the Dublin hospitals to the regional units, but only in a supported way.  We work closely with the clinician we have put in place in regard to the putting in place of education and supports in the regional units.  Increasingly, we are holding shared clinics in the regional units.  We are trying to keep services child and family centric so that service users can access services locally and only need to come to Dublin as required.  There is no additionality.  Cork has plans for a hospital.  In regard to the plans for the elective hospitals, we have been working with our colleagues in the regional units identifying the parameters that we use for the model of care to try to ensure the most efficient use of bed planning.  Cork is the only region that has identified additional plans.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019011600002#YY00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Eil&iacute;sh Hardiman","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1547629200,"counter":650,"content":"<p>My question was if there are plans to close beds that are currently being utilised for paediatrics.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019011600002#ZZ00200","speaker":"1302"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1547629200,"counter":651,"content":"<p>No.  We are testing the model of care with the ambulatory and other care centres that could possibly bring benefits around that, but that would need to be tested and demonstrated and then taken into consideration as part of the transformation programme.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy asked about the Crumlin children's hospital site.  It is important to record our appreciation of the committee's help in getting the legislation to merge the three children's hospitals through in 2018.  As of 1 January, Children's Health Ireland governs the provision of paediatric services in the Dublin hospitals at Crumlin, Temple Street and Tallaght and will open services in Connolly hospital in the middle of this year.  Under the legislation, the voluntary boards of Crumlin and Temple Street hospitals had to voluntarily transfer their assets and liabilities to the new entity.  The Crumlin hospital campus was owned by the board and it has transferred to Children's Health Ireland.  We can only use our assets to deliver services to children.  The future use of the campus has not been explored.  We will use it to deliver children's services until such time as the new children's hospital has opened and, as such, it will be occupied for the next four years.  We will have to engage in a planning process in regard to the future use of the site.  Following on from the merger, we see it as a planning option that we will put into place over the next few years.  We certainly have use of the site for the next four years.  Its future use has to benefit the children's hospitals.  That is the condition under which it was transferred and it is the only purpose for which we can use it.<\/p> <p>  On the naming of the hospital, I am happy to clarify that there is no proposal to sell the name of the children's hospital, which the Minister has confirmed.  We have already reported that there is a process to be engaged in for naming the hospital.  It will acknowledge the work that has been done to date and take into consideration nominations and submissions made.  We intend to kick off the process of naming the hospital soon.<\/p> <p>  On the Deputy's question as to whether there will be an opportunity to have philanthropic fundraising for parts of the hospital recognised, that is up for consideration.  Many of the children's hospitals already do this.  On the children's research and innovation centre, planning permission has been secured.  The lands on which the centre will be built are owned by the HSE and so whatever is constructed on the land will be owned by the HSE.  As in the case of Crumlin children's hospital, funding for the children's research and innovative centre will come from philanthropic fundraising.  We see this as an ideal opportunity for naming one part of the building.<\/p><p>There are commercial elements that are feasible that we are exploring.  Those are only in the discussion stages and will work through the HSE and the Department.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019011600002#ZZ00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Eil&iacute;sh Hardiman","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1547629200,"counter":653,"content":"<p>On that point, I saw a posting on social media from somebody who was outraged at the suggestion that the naming rights for any part of the national children's hospital would be sold off.  The individual wondered, no doubt tongue in cheek, whether we could see the name of a brand of cigarettes being borne by the national children's cancer research centre.  The fact is that once that process is started, there is less and less control over it.  I could point to examples in the third level sector where this practice does not only represent poor value for money but also assists individuals in purchasing a certain amount of credibility that they possibly should not have.  I am referring to very wealthy individuals who, in a very tax efficient manner, channel money into certain causes.<\/p> <p>  That would concern me.  It could be said that it is done all over the world but we have only to look across the water to see what is being done over there.  We are not replicating that.  Just because something is being done somewhere else does not mean we should be doing it as well.  At this stage, given that the process appears to be advanced, does Ms Hardiman have a set of criteria to ensure that it would not, for example, be possible to have a children's cancer research centre with the name of a cigarette brand or, indeed, an obesity centre branded with the name of a fast food company?

As part of the exercise we have done, and ultimately the report to the HSE, we have learned lessons.  As always, there were positives as well as negatives, and we identified two in my statement.  I will go through them a little.  On cost reductions, because we are in an inflationary cycle, the tenders received were higher than the pre-tender estimates.  In those cases, people invariably look for cost reductions.  Again, in hindsight, we are referring to looking for a cost reduction at a time when prices were still inflating at 6% or 7%.  A cost reduction might also be an alternative material.  While in that inflationary cycle, however, there is no guarantee that the cost reduction will come to anything and eventually one may end up back where one started.  That was a lesson learned in the cycle.  Those things cannot necessarily be predicted.  They were all done with good intentions and the contractors bought into it, but when we interrogated deliverability over the months, we found it was not possible.<\/p> <p>  The other question was on reporting.

Like many members of the committee I feel that Irish children have been neglected for a long time at Our Lady's Children's Hospital, Crumlin.  I have reason to be there a bit myself, and I often send the Minister for Health photographs of the walls to remind him what it is like.  I look forward to this project reaching completion in 2022.<\/p> <p>  I am not a big fan of fellows learning on the job when they are getting paid to do a job.  It is quite shocking that Mr. Costello would say that a process has worked well when we are at the price we are at currently.  It is rule 101 that the difference between the tendering price and the contract price must be watched.  Who was watching this?  Was a team of quantity surveyors employed in the initial tendering phase?  Regarding the differential between the tender price and the contract price, I am assuming that a team of quantity surveyors was involved, and I am assuming that all of the work it did was therefore pointless if there was such a difference between point 1 and point 2.  Perhaps Mr. Costello can elaborate on that. <\/p> <p>  Deputy Louise O'Reilly was talking about this as I was coming in.  I missed the start of what she was saying.  Can the witnesses clarify that other than the three bits the witnesses identified as being operated by other people, the land will all be kept under HSE ownership?  Can they also clarify that no external private company will be contracted to provide services in the hospital?  For example, can we be assured that the cath lab, the minor injuries unit, if there is one, or whatever facilities there are will not be run by a private entity?  Can we be assured that we are not going to carve bits out and allow them to be operated by a private medical company despite being owned by the HSE?  It is something we will probably discuss in this term at the Joint Committee on Health.  I have seen an emerging trend of private companies operating in sites with HSE logos over the door.  It is something that concerns me.  Perhaps the witnesses could clarify that for me.  <\/p> <p>  Mr. Pollock referred to the change in clinical standards.  I assume he is saying that if some piece of equipment or infrastructure that will be of benefit to the hospital comes on board between now and 2022, the hospital will want to move with the times.  Technically, there could be another bill if a new type of magical cable comes out and the board will just have to pay it.  I am assuming as much.

If the witnesses do not have it, we have a serious problem in that the witnesses have not looked at the outcomes in terms of cost overruns in other countries involving the model they state is the best one.  That is my point.  At the start of this meeting, the witnesses spoke about cables.  They had a price for cables.  It seems insane that they had 5.5 km of cable but in their first phase of pricing, they did not know how many strips of cable would be needed and whether it would be 5 x 5 km.  How could they start off a tendering process without knowing how much wire they needed or without having a sum built in for that so that they could say it could go between X and X x 10?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019011600002#GGG00800","speaker":"1297"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1547629200,"counter":789,"content":"<p>I will explain the process again.  First, we did deep analysis in terms of ultimately deciding that the two-stage process was appropriate for this project.  One thing that is certain and that has been learned in Ireland, the UK and internationally is that the model of traditional tendering where the client designs it without any involvement with contractors has been proven to fail repeatedly because the contractors invariably bid at or below cost and try to exploit the opportunities if there is a looseness in the contract documentation.  It is a very competitive marketplace.  With the two-stage tender, one works on the basis of a preliminary design, the contractor then works with the design team to develop that to completeness and the contractor takes the risk from that day forward.

We have put together a submission that the committee may have seen and it conveys the points we wish to make; I will speak to that rather than read it for the committee in order to highlight a few points.  Mr. Dignam will deal with any queries on what we suggest might be imperfections in the Bill as it currently stands but I will speak more to the main point in the submission, which is the suggestion that perhaps the model selected in the draft Bill is not the best way to go about addressing what is an important matter.<\/p> <p>  I should start by saying that it is to be welcomed that there is a legislative response to the important issue of Ireland being in default with respect to its international obligations under the European Convention on Human Rights.  It has been made clear in court and Ireland has accepted it in a number of cases.  Perhaps it is boring to say it but it must be said that the root cause of court delays is the fact that our courts are not properly resourced.  There are not enough appointed judges, registrars or support for the judges.  If this persists, it is likely the problems associated with court delays will also persist.  Nonetheless, it is proper to address the concerns raised in the Bill.<\/p> <p>  The Bill chooses a non courts-based model of providing compensation to those affected by court delays.  The Bill envisages there would be an administrative tribunal or body set up that would be staffed by a retired judge or judges, who would then adjudicate on the question of whether compensation should be awarded, and if so, in what amount.<\/p><p>The point we have offered is that while it might appear superficially attractive to take the function out of the courts, take it away from lawyers and, as it were, make it simplified and cheaper, and while those are legitimate and proper concerns, we believe that it may not be in the public interest, as we have laid out in our submission.  It may not be the best way of approaching this issue and delivering on the objectives the Bill is directed to meet.<\/p><p> One of the reasons is expense.  It is difficult to identify a good, valid reason as to why the Exchequer should be hit with the undoubted significant cost associated with setting up a whole new administrative structure, staffing it, paying salaries, paying for clerical staff, paying for an office through rent or purchase, and resourcing it.  For this reason we suggest that this is perhaps not the ideal way to proceed.<\/p><p> There is a pre-built, existing structure that is very efficient when it is working well, which is the courts.  We make the point in our paper that the Oireachtas, in earlier legislative provisions, decided that the best way to deal with meeting our objectives under the European Convention on Human Rights and providing justice for our citizens across a range of legal areas is to do it on the courts-based model.  For instance, section 3 of the existing European Convention on Human Rights Act allows a citizen who has been wrongly deprived of his or her liberty to go to the Circuit Court to make a case to be awarded compensation if he or she has been locked up unlawfully and suffered the indignity of being put into prison without just cause.  That was a legislative decision made by the Oireachtas, and the Bar Council of Ireland feels that it is difficult to identify a good reason the same model should not be followed here.  It is not known quite how many cases there might be of plaintiffs seeking relief for court delays.  There are likely to be more than those who would seek damages for being unlawfully imprisoned, but there may not be too many.<\/p><p> This is the other point.  Whatever about the issue of principle, it is difficult to see why it would be justified economically.  The pure, raw numbers make it difficult to see how it could be justified to set up an entirely new administrative structure for what may not be ultimately a large number of cases.  That issue, however, is a little bit unknown.<\/p><p> At the level of principle and given the potential legal complexity that is associated with claims for compensation for breaches of Article 13 and the right to speedy access to justice, and given that the European Convention on Human Rights has identified that these claims can be really quite complex, although not always, this is an issue that is best left to the courts that are well used to receiving submissions, weighing up competing interests and judging how best to give justice when there has been a breach of rights.  These are routine matters for a Circuit Court, High Court or District Court judge or whoever it might be to add to his or her bundle of cases.  There would not have to be the extra amount of training and costs associated with setting up an entirely new separate structure.  The Bar Council of Ireland believes that this can be properly dealt with under the existing courts structure.  That would be most fair to the citizen and best suited to the public interest with regard to these various headings.<\/p><p> There is also a risk, if one proceeds down the road of setting up a separate administrative body, that the body itself could be at risk of being judicially reviewed or having complaints made against it on grounds of delay.  It also could be challenged for making what might be thought of as unreasonable decisions if it decides to refuse an application for compensation or if it awards what the citizen feels is too little.  We believe that this is a further stand-alone ground for leaving these cases to the parties that are best equipped to deal with the issues, namely, trained judges who are independent and well used to dealing with legal cases and the complexity of legal issues.<\/p><p> We have made a number of recommendations in our paper, which members may have seen.  We suggest that these matters be left to the courts and perhaps a similar model chosen along the lines of section 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights Act.<\/p><p>The idea is simply to create the statutory remedy of going to court and allowing that to be done.  As to which court, it would be a matter entirely for the Legislature of course.  We do not believe there is any particular reason to depart from the pre-existing model of doing it in the Circuit Court or perhaps doing it in the High Court.  That is entirely a matter for the Legislature.  We acknowledge there may be different reasons for choosing whichever comment committee members might make.<\/p><p> It is undoubtedly an issue that has a degree of urgency in that Ireland is in default.  That is not inconsequential and needs to be immediately addressed.  We believe that delayed claims need to be considered and dealt with properly under the existing and well-provided established structure.  The ideal environment for the fair and just determination of these Article 6 breach claims is the court's model.  By taking that approach we believe there would be consistency in the law.  It is already being done in that way and we do not find the case persuasive &ndash; although it is a matter entirely for the Houses &ndash; for lifting it and creating an entirely new structure.  We do not find that would really be the way to proceed from a practical point of view, from a justice point of view or from a principle point of view.  I would be happy to take any questions on the issues arising.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019011600002#O00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Miche&aacute;l P.

We are a voluntary independent legal rights organisation that exists to promote access to justice.  We believe access to justice includes not only legal aid but access to the courts, to effective remedies and to fair, just and socially inclusive laws.  We welcome the opportunity to contribute to this pre-legislative scrutiny and we welcome that the matter will be put on a legislative basis.<\/p> <p>  We also view delay as the major inhibitor of access to justice.  From our work we see that delay arises in several arenas, including waiting times for legal aid.  The most recent figures from the Legal Aid Board show a waiting time of up to 42 weeks for a first appointment in the Blanchardstown Legal Aid Board law centre and more than six months in several other centres.  The processing time for social welfare appeals is a problem.  The most recent social welfare appeals report showed that the average time to process social welfare appeals was 23.6 weeks and 30.3 weeks in the case of supplementary welfare allowance, which is supposed to provide a basic safety net payment.  The most recent report of the social welfare appeals office states that 63.6% of oral appeals were successful.  The Court of Appeal was set up to reduce delay but individuals now must wait for up to two years before getting an appeal heard there.<\/p> <p>  We are keen for the committee to look at the issue of delay not only in respect of the contents of the Bill but as a systemic issue.  There is a commitment in the programme for Government to commission an annual study on court efficiency and sitting times to provide accurate measures for improving access to justice.  We urge that this commitment would be fulfilled.  There is a real need to have accurate measures to measure improvements in access to justice.<\/p> <p>  A review of the administration of civil justice is ongoing.  It is being carried out by the High Court President, Mr. Justice Peter Kelly.  One of the aims of the review is to improve access to justice.  Clearly, the issue of delay will be looked at by this review group.  We submit that the outcome of this review should be of fundamental interest to the committee.  We ask that the committee would make access to justice a central ongoing feature of its work.<\/p> <p>  I will comment on the heads of the Bill.   We have seven basic points to make and I will go through them quickly.  Delays that occur before quasi-judicial bodies and tribunals should be included in the legislation.  This is important from the perspective of calculating when proceedings commence and should be taken into account in determining any compensatory remedy for unreasonable delays that arise in proceedings before such bodies.<\/p> <p>  Whether a delay in a particular case arises directly or indirectly through delays in a related case should not make any difference to the entitlement to apply for compensation and to be awarded it, if merited.<\/p><p> Our third comment on the heads of the Bill is that the direct linking of any financial compensation payable under the proposed legislation to the principles and practices of the European Court of Human Rights is problematic and undesirable.  We suggest that the removal of specific references to the ECHR and Article 41 under head 8 would provide a more fluid and flexible remedy for court-based delays.  In turn, we could more readily provide a remedy for any breach of EU law that might arise in that regard than the present formulation would allow.<\/p><p> The fourth point in respect of the heads of the Bill is that, as proposed, the assessor would be a retired judge.  It is unclear to us why there is a need for a requirement for the High Court to approve awards of compensation given that it is also the forum for the determination of appeals under the proposed legislation.<\/p><p> Our fifth point relates to multiple claims.  The proposed Bill is silent in respect of further delays that might accrue after an award has been made and if the proceedings are not determined by that time.  We believe that the legislation should provide clarity in that regard.<\/p><p> The sixth point relates to where a case is ongoing in any application for case management before the courts.  We believe that judicial notice could be taken of any determination under the proposed Act by an assessor that unreasonable delay has occurred and the reasons for same.<\/p><p> The final point relates to costs.  There is no provision under the heads of the Bill for the expenses of making a successful application to be discharged by the State or Minister.  Inevitably, this means that such costs will be taken from the award.  This could possibly undermine the effectiveness of such a remedy.  We are suggesting that this issue could be remedied by providing for a flat fee to a practitioner who assists the client to make a successful application.  Such a measure should, in turn, require the practitioner to undertake not to seek further payment for an award.<\/p><p> These are our summary comments on the Bill.

Generally, people only do that once or twice in their lives.  Some people are lucky and never have to do it.  It is an extremely stressful process.  The good aspect of having the Bar Council and FLAC in attendance is that they are aware of the stress that the invocation of one's rights and having to seek justice can place on individuals.  Sometimes, people on the outside do not appreciate that.  Delay can have an aggravating impact on that stress.  Recently, a woman who was a complainant disclosed her identity in a rape trial.  One of the things she said after the accused had been convicted was that she had found the delay of four years, from her making her complaint to the years spent in the court process, extremely stressful.  There is a purpose behind the provisions within the European Convention on Human Rights, ECHR, on why there should be a speedy and effective remedy when delay has been introduced into the system.<\/p> <p>  My first question is for the Bar Council.  I may be wrong but, when we contemplate delays, there are two types in the court system, the first of which is the delay caused by a case not getting on for a period of time.  For example, it might not be listed on the first occasion or the next occasion.  The second type is the delay caused by a judge who, after hearing the case, does not give judgment promptly.  Are those the two types of delay we are considering?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019011600002#T00400","speaker":"1296"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1547645400,"counter":841,"content":"<p>Yes, but I will address the Deputy's comments on the stress of court proceedings first.  In many respects, that is what is being directed by the jurisprudence of the ECHR.  An anomaly arising from the heads of the Bill is that a victim or complainant in, for example, a criminal trial who has suffered stress and damage as a result of delays in our system does not appear to be one of the categories of person who can seek compensation.<\/p><p>In relation to the delays, the two types of delay the Deputy identified are the ones which we have also identified.  These are, as the Deputy stated, the delay in a case getting on because of the shortage of judges or resources in the courts system to enable cases to get on when they should, and also the post hearing delay of a judge not giving judgment expeditiously.  Of course, the latter delay is not the fault of the judge.  That judge finishes one case on a given day, takes up another case the next morning and when he is finished that case, takes up yet another case.  The demands on judicial resources are such that it is difficult for judges to provide judgments in cases that they may have heard two, three or four cases ago within a reasonable and quick period of time such as to avoid any complaint or delay.  Those are the two principal types of delay.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019011600002#T00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Conor Dignam","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1547645400,"counter":843,"content":"<p>In terms of the latter delay where it is after a hearing has concluded, a judge in that case will have other factors or issues that he or she must deal with.

The Bar Council, as the representative body for barristers, is constantly engaged with the notion of systemic reform.  Yesterday, if not last week, we finalised a submission to a review that is under way at the moment on the civil justice side of the system, not the criminal side but the superior courts civil justice system.  Mr. Justice Peter Kelly, the President of the High Court, is conducting that review across a range of areas, for instance, judicial review, which is associated with supervising the powers and activities of lower tribunals and lower courts in the High Court.  It also includes the whole area of discovery, which is a big issue in litigation, including the costs associated with discovery, the delays that discovery brings and undesirable aspects of discovery.<\/p> <p>  We very much engaged with the process that is under way.  Various interested parties have put forward their views, not just lawyer groups but officials in the Courts Service and those involved in the system, with a view to trying to achieve efficiencies and improve access to justice, which is really what this should be all about, and also creating a situation where members of the public are informed about their rights so that they are encouraged to go to court and participate in what is a very important forum for the vindication of their rights.  These initiatives take many forms.  One simple path that we are following at the moment is an endeavour to try to make the law less mysterious and use plain ordinary English in legislation, regulations and submissions that barristers make.  There is an encouragement being given to people - I know this seems odd - to actually speak in the English language, rather than in obscure old fashioned legalese which, unfortunately, has been a feature of the system, certainly in the past and perhaps not only in the past.  The aim is to make the system more accessible and relevant to litigants and members of the public so that they will know their rights and have an opportunity to access the courts to vindicate those rights.  That is another project that is very much under way.  Much has been done under that heading but more remains to be done.<\/p> <p>  I agree with the Deputy that this is not a simple case of calling for more money or resources to be thrown at the courts.  Just as I am sure those advocating for reforms on the health side would say the solution is not all about appointing more doctors, nurses, hospital porters or whomever.  It is about channelling those resources, improving efficiencies and reforming the system so that a better product is delivered and a better service is provided to members of the public.  We are very much aware of that and that is why we have not just called for an increase in resources but, in fact, a correct channelling of those resources.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019011600002#X00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Miche&aacute;l P.

We are not suggesting it should be the High Court.  The reason we identified the Circuit Court as the appropriate court is that the Oireachtas has already identified the Circuit Court as being the appropriate court to deal with claims under section 3A of the Act.  From a consistency point of view, we do not see any good reason to depart from the model that was put in place by the Oireachtas as recently as 2014 when the amendment was introduced.<\/p> <p>  On the substance of the point, which is whether a court based system would be a disincentive to individuals, the first point to note is that there is an appeals process in place.  If the assessor model, as currently framed, is established, an individual can bring a claim to the assessor.  If he or she is successful in that claim, the award is then appealable by the State and the appeal goes directly from the assessor to the High Court.  This means the individual is then dragged into the High Court despite not wanting to be there.  Avoiding a court based model at first instance does not avoid an individual ending up before the courts.  For this reason, it seems to us there is no good reason the individual should not be permitted to go to court with his or her claim.<\/p> <p>  The second point is that individuals want their claims to be determined in a fair and transparent manner.  As I mentioned, the European Court of Human Rights, ECHR, has clearly stated that the question of a delay and compensation for delay is one of complexity.  An individual does not want his or her complex issue to be determined by an assessor on the basis of paperwork and written reports.  Some cases will be straightforward but others will not.  The claimant will want to have his or her say in regard to whether compensation should be awarded.<\/p> <p>  Equally, the assessor model deprives the State of the right to participate at that first stage.  The claim is submitted and the State has no right to participate or make submissions on whether compensation should be awarded.  If compensation is awarded, there is then an automatic appeal on the part of the State, not to the Circuit Court or District Court, but to the High Court.  There does not seem to us to be the disincentive which Deputy Chambers mentions attached to a court based system as opposed to an assessor system.  It would seem to us that the assessor system provides for greater curtailment on an individual's rights and entitlements to have his or her case disposed of fairly and transparently.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019011600002#Y00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Conor Dignam"},{"type":"speech","time":1547645400,"counter":888,"content":"<p>Does FLAC have an opinion on the matter?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019011600002#Z00100","speaker":"1255"},{"type":"speech","time":1547645400,"counter":889,"content":"<p>I invite Ms Barry or Ms Lucey to respond.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019011600002#Z00200","speaker":"1269"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1547645400,"counter":890,"content":"<p>We are not tied to any particular model but we are concerned that whatever model is adopted would be accessible, speedy and at a low cost.

This feeds into the efficiencies.  There has been an exponential rise in lay litigants going before the court, leading to judges having to spend a huge amount of time guiding the lay litigant through the system and procedures so they can at least get their cases heard.  While judges are very good at doing this, they do not really have the time to do it.

It is not simply a question of the ECHR case law making this clear or a question of looking at the raw level of the length of the delay.<\/p><p>Rather, it is a question of measuring the delay and assessing how culpable it is in the context of the nature of the proceedings at issue, what was at stake for the litigant and whether the justifications put forward on behalf of the responding party passed muster.

There are also people who are highly stressed, elderly or, perhaps, do not have long to live, or whatever the particular personal circumstances may be.  All of these feed into the measurement.

A section 3A claim for compensation for unlawful detention, which is directed into the Circuit Court by the ECHR Act, can only be made where there has already been a finding by a court that there was unlawful detention.  In such a case the substantive issue has already been decided and, in effect, what is being decided by the Circuit Court in this instance is the level of compensation.  Under the system being established in the Bill the first things that have to be decided is whether there was a delay, whether there was a culpable delay, in other words whether the State is guilty or responsible for that delay, and how much compensation should be paid.  Under the proposed system the first two elements, which are really the substantive findings that have to be made, are being passed to an assessor to determine on the basis of the papers.  To draw an analogy, it would be like having an assessor deciding based on papers whether a person has been unlawfully detained.  This would not allow the person to make full submissions or representations and would not allow the person alleged to have unlawfully detained the person to make submissions or representations on whether the detention was unlawful.  It seems anomalous to put a more complex issue, which is the compensation for delay, into an assessor system with the more straightforward issue of compensation for a detention that has already been found to be unlawful going to the Circuit Court.  That seems to give rise to an anomaly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019011600002#BB00100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Conor Dignam"},{"type":"speech","time":1547645400,"counter":905,"content":"<p>I wish to make several more points before I conclude.

The first relates to FLAC's submission but the Bar Council of Ireland might wish to comment also.  FLAC identified an inconsistency in the approach.  It identified inconsistency regarding the European Court of Human Rights Act 2003.  I understand it is related to the fact that compensation in the Bill is based on ECHR principles and that it is a sort of compromise based on the arrangements across the various jurisdictions under the ECHR, some are very different economically, socially and legally.  Could the delegates comment on that?<\/p> <p>  Let me refer to another point FLAC made, which also applies equally to the alternative put forward by the Bar Council of Ireland.  I refer to a case where there is a delay in determining the quantum of compensation and where that compensation is determined by the High Court.  When such a case returns to the High Court under the process, there is a perception of a conflict of interest or of a lack of independence, even if there are different judges.<\/p> <p>  Could the representatives from FLAC address both of those points?

Our point is that the State is really required to put in place a remedy that is effective in the domestic sense rather than replicate a remedy that might be available to a litigant that takes the very long road to get to the European Court of Human Rights.<\/p> <p>  The difficulty we perceive is that the quantum before the European court is quite different from what would be awarded by the Irish courts in similar cases but that is because the European court is doing a completely different job when it decides a case against the State than an Irish court or quasi-judicial tribunal when it decides on a dispute before it.  Often the European court will say it has decided there has been a breach of rights, in the view that the simple act of deciding the case in one's favour and declaring there has been a breach is adequate compensation or, as it often calls it, \"just satisfaction\".  It will often not provide any remedy in damages at all.  On other occasions, where it does consider providing remedy in damages, it is often an amount that might well be a very effective remedy in Bulgaria but that would hardly pay for one's flight from Ireland to Strasbourg if one were to go there to have one's case heard.  The same applies to legal aid.  That can be awarded by the European court.<\/p> <p>  It is like apples and oranges.  While we should be providing for apples, we have ended up providing for oranges, and that seems to be the proposal.  Consider the position if we were to reconsider all those cases that went before the European Court of Human Rights and found Ireland in default.  If we actually had a properly functioning system of compensation for delays operating in a domestic sense, there never would have been a finding against Ireland.  Therefore, the absence of a domestic remedy was the issue but there is now no need to bring in a European remedy and to try to transplant it into the Irish context.  To us, there seems to be no real justification for making the direct linkage, and that direct linkage is not made in the European Court of Human Rights Act 2003, which is the main legislation providing remedies for breaches of the convention.<\/p> <p>  The other problem we have identified, which is probably speculative to some extent, concerns the question of an excessive delay in obtaining a remedy for a breach of one's rights under EU law.  If somebody takes a case before the courts, where is he or she supposed to go for a remedy?<\/p><p>If machinery is already being put in place by the State for delays, why should it not accommodate delays in whatever context they arise, be it EU law or a breach of Article 6 of the convention?  Again, it seems to be a misplaced notion that this is purely a remedy that should stand in the European Court of Justice rather than before the domestic courts.<\/p><p> The other issue raised is the loop that seems to have been included in the legislation whereby an award made goes to the High Court to be approved and then to the same court for an appeal to be heard on it.  While a High Court judge will no doubt act independently if considering an appeal, it could create a perception that the appeals process is not wholly independent if the same forum that approves the award hears the appeal.  That is just a basic point.  Maybe it needs to be considered.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019011600002#CC00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Sin&eacute;ad Lucey","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1547645400,"counter":912,"content":"<p>Would the representatives from the Bar Council of Ireland like to add to that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019011600002#DD00200","speaker":"1269"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1547645400,"counter":913,"content":"<p>Everything has been said eloquently.

Where, for the sake of argument, the assessor would decide without the State being involved in the assessment, it would then go to the High Court without the State being involved and the High Court would approve the award.  The State would have a right of appeal against that award and the appeal would go to the High Court.  FLAC's concern is that the same court would be deciding on the award and the assessment.  We do not regard that, on the level of principle, as being a difficulty because High Court judges, day in, day out, have to exercise independent judgment and engage in independent decision-making.  Therefore, we do not see a difficulty with a High Court judge hearing an appeal where a different High Court judge has already approved the award.  This is because they would be hearing different arguments and would have the benefit of the argument made by the State.  What we do believe it underlines is that the drafters of the heads of Bill have identified that the question of compensation for a delay in proceedings is a very significant issue, so significant that it warrants the High Court being involved in deciding that the award is an appropriate award.  To us, that underlines that the matter is so significant it should actually be determined by the courts in the first instance rather than an assessor.  Other than somebody in drafting the heads of the Bill having identified it as a significant issue, we do not see any other reason the High Court could be involved.  If the High Court is to be involved in approving the award in the first place, why not simply have the courts determine the substantive issue and the quantum of damages?

I would like to read for her section (11) of the citation of the regulation:<\/p><blockquote>The importance of health aspects needs to be recognised in relation to noise problems, and it is therefore important that those aspects be taken into consideration in a consistent manner at all airports when a decision is taken on noise abatement objectives, taking into account the existence of common Union rules in this area.

I am not proposing to dictate to the noise regulator what its noise abatement objective should include, but, for the reasons I have given to the Deputy, I am very limited in what I can concede by way of amendments if I am to stick to the advice given to me, including the advice of legal counsel.  I have endeavoured to do so as much as I can and, where possible, taken on board the proposals made by other Deputies.

Perhaps we could determine for Report Stage whether there is another way of referring to the important report of the WHO.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTS2019011600002#F00400","speaker":"1301"},{"type":"speech","time":1547631000,"counter":940,"content":"<p>May I respond to those points?

The Minister talks about quality of life, but that is not health specifically.  Obviously health is an aspect of it.  However, because of the impact and the emphasis put on this question by the World Health Organization, WHO, because it is so important, we need to specify that we are not just talking about quality of life as something abstract or nice or an additional extra.  It is an integral part of people's right to health.  It has a severe impact on their mental health, their well-being and their physical health if they do not get enough sleep and if they are intruded upon negatively by noise.  My point is that while we know the legislation refers to quality of life, nowhere are we specifying health.

Many of us do not believe that Fingal County Council is the appropriate authority to carry out this function.  We all believe it was chosen in a hurry because the Minister had left it too late to bring in a competent authority on noise regulation and as a result, the deadline was missed by the time he realised that the Irish Aviation Authority, IAA, would not be allowed to carry out the function because it failed the independence test.  However, I am surprised that Fingal County Council passed the independence test given that it is paid rates by the airport and relies on the airport for part of its rates.  It is high time that we move away from having bodies regulate entities when they rely on those same entities for their income.  It is the same with the IAA and safety regulation, although apparently legislation is being introduced to break up the IAA for that very reason.  The Minister might correct me if I am wrong.  <\/p><p>If it is not appropriate in the case of the IAA and civil aviation regulation, why should it be allowed in the case of Fingal County Council?  Many Deputies are of this opinion, as are the residents who do not have any confidence in Fingal County Council overseeing matters because it relies on the airport for funds.  It does not inspire confidence in anybody.  The thinking is very much that it was a rush job by the Minister, and an 11th hour decision taken on his behalf.  That is the very reason why it should be replaced with the Commissioner for Aviation Regulation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTS2019011600002#H00200","speaker":"1333"},{"type":"speech","time":1547631000,"counter":953,"content":"<p>Does the Minister wish to respond?

This is the section that deals with who should be the competent authority.  It is a key part of the legislation and this is probably the most substantial group of amendments before us.  The key job of transposing EU Regulation No. 598\/2014 is to establish a competent authority which will be appointed to set up the rules and regulations for dealing with the impact of aircraft noise in line with the balanced approach.  The authority in the European Union is very clear on what the basis of the body should be.  I reiterate it states:<\/p><blockquote>The competent authority responsible for adopting noise-related operating restrictions should be independent of any organisation involved in the airport&rsquo;s operation, air transport or air navigation service provision, or representing the interests thereof and of the residents living in the vicinity of the airport.  This should not be understood as requiring Member States to modify their administrative structures or decision-making procedures. <\/blockquote> <p>A couple of years after saying that the IAA would be the body which would carry out this function, the Minister has done a massive somersault and is now saying that it will not be the IAA, but will be Fingal County Council.  There are several different solutions proposed as to how we should deal with this.<\/p><p>The Minister thinks it should be Fingal County Council and we will address that point in a minute because there are alternatives.  The first point I want to make is that we have to see what Ireland is doing in the context of what other countries are doing.  The Minister's proposition to appoint Fingal County Council not only does not meet the requirement for independence, as outlined by Deputy Munster, but is completely at variance with what every single other jurisdiction in the European Union has done.  We know that eight member states are not required to bring this in because their airports are too small.  Another eight member states have designated the Civil Aviation Authority, the equivalent of the Irish Aviation Authority, IAA.  Those eight member states did not seem to have a problem with independence and that is the biggest group of other member states.  Five member states have designated a Government Department.  Two members states have designated multiple bodies, including a Government Department and a national agency.  Two member states have not completed it yet.  Three member states have designated one or more local, regional or federal authorities.  The stance Ireland has taken is utterly bizarre.  It is unheard of for a local authority to take on the national regulatory responsibility of a competent national authority.  <\/p><p> I will not labour the points made by Deputy Munster but the residents know, as does everybody, from dialogue with Fingal County Council that so much of the council's rate base and influence comes from the DAA that it impairs the council's independence and there is no question or doubt about that.  I have seen the Minister's responses on that, where he says it is not really 20% and is only 8% when all the income streams are taken in.  That is splitting hairs because it is quite obvious that the DAA is the biggest payer to the income of Fingal County Council.  The council granted the original permissions for the airport runway and so on, so it is safe to say that not only is it not independent but it could never even be perceived to be independent.  There is a huge problem with Fingal County Council.<\/p><p> I do not want to repeat the Minister's words back to him, but in answers to parliamentary questions over recent years, he told us that the IAA was the best show in town and all that good stuff, and he is now standing that on its head.  The reports that the Department gave us as to why it had to be Fingal County Council and why the other organisations were not suitable did not add up.  Nobody is suggesting the IAA but the Minister does not seem to have taken on board the game-changing recommendation of the Commission for Aviation Regulation, CAR.  That is the favoured choice of residents.  It is not their exclusive choice because the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, may also be appropriate but most groups would prefer the CAR as the alternative to Fingal because the goalposts have now moved with the decision to split the IAA and the division of the commercial and regulatory functions.<\/p><p> The State is now on the cusp of bringing forward other legislation to have one single regulator for aviation which is a highly specialist and technical area.  We could bring it all under the one remit and the Minister chose not to include aircraft noise, a key regulatory function, under that brief.  It does not make sense.  The only answer we got as to why it was not suitable was that they do not have the capacity at the moment.  It is recognised that Fingal does not have the capacity at the moment.  The EPA would not have the capacity for dealing with this.  It is a highly specialist area.  The reason it fits better coming in under the CAR, with its aviation expertise, is precisely because the people who regulate aviation are highly skilled technicians.  They are of a pay grade and a level of expertise that is not replicated elsewhere.  It is not replicated in the EPA and it is certainly not replicated in Fingal County Council.  Fianna F&aacute;il's dressed up version of Fingal County Council is still Fingal County Council.  The suggestion that the council would set up an aircraft noise regulation division is not sufficiently independent from Fingal County Council.<\/p><p>In addition, an area set up solely for airport noise regulation will not be sufficiently busy to attract and maintain the level of expertise necessary to support this type of venture, if my point is understood.  That is critical if it is just airport noise.  In this group of amendments one of the solutions is the Fianna F&aacute;il idea of Fingal County Council setting up an independent noise regulator.  It is important to state, first, that the perceived link with Fingal is still there as it is still under Fingal County Council.  An office to the side, sitting in Fingal but called the airport noise regulator, will not be working morning, noon and night.  It will not have a critical mass of work or enough work to sustain the level of expertise necessary to be enticed into this outfit.  The only arena where one could get that is in the CAR, and it is not there at present.  Indeed, it is nowhere now.  However, that is the natural home for it and we must be clear about that.  Most of the residents' groups favour this as the alternative.<\/p><p> There was openness to the idea of the EPA possibly being considered as well.  It is not hard and fast but in terms of aviation expertise, the EPA is not really at the races.  Residents are highly aggrieved at this situation.  The Minister reports in other replies to parliamentary questions that the EPA has said it is not up to the job.  That is not true.  Residents have gone to the trouble of getting freedom of information responses regarding the EPA and its involvement in this, and there has been no substantial dialogue with the EPA in terms of whether it might want this function.  It is not true to say, as has been said, that the EPA does not want the gig.  The records show that it has not been asked about the gig.  It is important to put that on the record.<\/p><p> It is also important to record that concern has been expressed about the fact that the IAA submission to the recent airport noise plan by Fingal County Council was a little too deferential to the existing planning restrictions linked to the new runway.  It made the point that it was concerned about the operating restrictions.  That is beyond its remit.  This should not be the basis of the concern.  The concern is about the best way forward for reducing the impact of noise, not the airport restricting operations even though there is a knock-on in that regard.<\/p><p> For all those reasons the CAR is the best fit.  That is entirely in line with what most of the other member states have done.  We are setting up a new regulatory authority.  Everything is changing.  The impact on climate change, for example, means aircraft regulation is something that will have to be taken a great deal more seriously, and the impact of noise is a key component of that.  Leaving it out does not make any sense.  The points as to why it should not be Fingal County Council have been well made.  As to what else, the CAR is the best fit simply because of the technical expertise aspect and that level on the food chain, as it were.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTS2019011600002#H00700","speaker":"1259","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1547631000,"counter":960,"content":"<p>Five amendments in this group are in my name and I am the joint proposer of others.  My amendments are related to my view and that of my party and the residents.  They are based on my party's legal advice that Fingal County Council should not be designated the competent body because it is not independent enough.  An alternative body with the required independence is needed.  The Minister and his advisers have got it wrong.  It is no shame to admit that, even at this stage.  On Second Stage many of us asked the Minister to take on board what people were saying and to return on this Stage with an amended version of the legislation which took that on board.  We were not making it up just for the sake of it.  There is a real sense that it does not have independence, and there should be recognition of that from the Minister and his officials.<\/p><p>The two proposals in this grouping for alternative bodies are the Commission for Aviation Regulation, CAR, and the EPA.  My preference is for the CAR but I am not hung up on that.  If the Minister or Department officials felt that the EPA was better from their point of view, I would take that advice.  During the debate on Second Stage, I spoke about the lack of independence and gave the ESB as example of true independence, where we have EirGrid, Electric Ireland and the ESB itself.  They all have separate independent boards with no mixed or overlapping functions.<br\/><br\/>What the Minister is proposing here is that the CEO of Fingal County Council - referred to as FCC in the Bill - will not be independent of the local authority itself.  That is a fact.  The Bill, as proposed, does not achieve functional separation between the competent authority and the local residents.  Deputy Clare Daly has gone through section 13 and the need for independence.  Article 3.2 goes on to provide that:<\/p><blockquote>The competent authorities shall be independent of any organisation which could be affected by noise-related action.  That independence may be achieved through a functional separation.<\/blockquote><p>That is open to challenge because what is proposed here does not have that functional separation.  In respect of my amendments, my proposal is to go for the CAR as the competent authority.  My amendment No. 4 is about interpretation and it inserts &quot;CAR&quot;.  My amendment No. 6, in section 2, again on interpretation, deletes &quot;FCC&quot;.  My amendment No. 7, in section 3 on the designation of the competent authority, replaces &quot;FCC&quot; with &quot;CAR&quot;.  My amendment No. 10, in section 3 on the designation of competent authority, deletes lines 10 to 38 on page 7 and lines 1 to 12 on page 8 because that section deals specifically with a relationship with a local authority.  The best thing to do, therefore, is to eliminate those lines completely if the CAR, or somebody else, is designated rather than Fingal County Council.  My amendment No. 42 also just replaces &quot;FCC&quot; with the &quot;CAR&quot;.<br\/><br\/>I am not going to go over all that has been said.  There is general agreement across the board, even from Fianna F&aacute;il in respect of what it is proposing.  There is no acceptance that this is independent enough.  Something has to change and I will certainly be hoping to achieve that between today and Report Stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTS2019011600002#K00200","speaker":"1301","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1547631000,"counter":962,"content":"<p>I will speak on my amendments in this group now as well.  It has been well flagged to the Minister, before Christmas in the debate that took place in the full D&aacute;il and in much of the correspondence that he would have received from residents who have studied this, that it is not appropriate that Fingal County Council would be responsible for monitoring and protecting residents in respect of noise.  It is not even the councillors, by the way, who would have any oversight as members elected by the residents.  It would be the CEO of Fingal County Council.<\/p> <p>  I will refer to some reasons for making this change, including the issue of expertise but also conflict of interest.  The reality is that the rates base upon which Fingal County Council is reliant immediately means that it is loathe to challenge any major developments in the airport in the way that would be potentially required to protect residents from noise.  The council is also reliant on development contributions and many of us who have been members of the council have seen that the airport is a major part of Fingal's overall development.  Nobody is saying that the airport should not develop but it is necessary to have some independent body involved which is not linked to its development.<\/p><p>In terms of expertise, the Minister has received correspondence from residents.  On 10 December, a presentation was made on the Dublin Airport noise action plan to the full membership of Fingal County Council, but that presentation did not even meet the requirements of the environmental noise directive.  It was meant to be a graphical presentation and include maps disclosing the areas where the noise limits were exceeded.  It is meant to show differences, the current position and the potential position if a new runway is built or an enhancement at the airport takes place, but none of that has been done.  Planning permission was given for the north runway and the construction contract awarded.  Therefore, at a minimum, one would expect the council to show difference maps and compare them with the existing position.  <\/p><p> The other issue is that noise levels increased dramatically between 2006 and 2016, but there was nothing in the plan to suggest Fingal County Council had done or was going to do anything about it.  It was very evident in the recent presentation that the council had taken quite a light touch regulation approach to noise issues at the airport.  On there being a conflict of interest, when the council grants planning permission to Aer Rianta, it receives &euro;21 million in development levies.  One can see, therefore, that it is implicated.  The authority that deals with noise regulation should be completely independent.  I am open on what that authority should be.  When I discussed the matter with some residents with whom I had been dealing, we felt the EPA would more be appropriate.  <\/p><p> On that subject, it was stated at previous meetings of this committee that the EPA would not be considered because it had not shown that it could step up to the plate.  It was also implied that it had indicated that it was not interested, which is completely untrue.  A resident made a FOI request to try to delve into this issue and iIt emerged that the EPA had not even been consulted.  No records showing that it had ever stated it was not interested were found in the trawl that took place.  Therefore, misinformation was given to this committee ruling out the EPA as a factor.  I can pass this information around if the Minister wants me to do so.  What was said was that discussions with individual members of staff had been checked and that they could not find any record.  All relevant persons in the EPA were asked if they had had any interaction on the issue and they had not.  Why, therefore, did somebody from the Department say they had?  It seems that residents are being given false information, for which the Minister should account.  <\/p><p> The Minister needs to listen.  Why would he not have the interests of residents at heart and appoint an independent body to regulate noise levels, rather than the planning authority which clearly has a conflict of interest and does not have the staff to do so?  I do not know if it wants to do so, but it would need to recruit a whole department.  I think it has enough on its plate in building housing during the worst housing crisis it has ever seen.  It seems that the EPA would be more appropriate, but I am open to the others mentioned in the other amendments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTS2019011600002#L00200","speaker":"1434","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1547631000,"counter":964,"content":"<p>I will speak to amendment No. 9 in my name which is included in this grouping.  <\/p> <p>  With the exception of Deputy Clare Daly, I have been the Member of the D&aacute;il who has been most vocal on the need to accelerate implementation of the EU regulation which was first requested of the Government almost four years ago.<\/p><p>I have repeatedly raised this issue with the Minister by way of parliamentary questions, priority questions, oral questions and written questions.  The manner in which he has handled the matter to date has contributed to the anxiety, fear and worry of the residents who need to be protected.  He has left us in a position where there is an urgent requirement at the 11th hour to have this EU regulation transposed onto the Irish Statute Book.  The Minister has even missed the timeline he set out last July and continues to miss every timeline he has set down.  He changes as he goes along.<\/p><p> In February 2018, the Minister first indicated that Fingal County Council would be made the competent authority.  I raised concerns then about the council's capacity and whether it would have the relevant expertise to ensure it would be independent and address the concerns of neighbours and residents, while at the same time allowing the airport to develop and grow.  We cannot ignore that the airport directly employs 20,000 people and indirectly employs a further 45,000 people.  It is, therefore, of great strategic importance not just to the local economy and the livelihoods of many people living in close proximity to it but also to the economy as a whole.  We are an island nation and given the serious uncertainties arising from Brexit, we need to realise how important a role Dublin Airport plays.<\/p><p> As I said, we raised the issue of the expertise as opposed to independence of Fingal County Council.  If we were to go down the route that other Deputies are suggesting, we would decide that Fingal County Council and every other county council could not adjudicate planning applications independently or fairly because all planning applications have the potential to deliver returns by way of development levies or commercial rates if the building or development in question is allowed to progress.  We are effectively saying that every decision a council will ever take could be compromised because it would have a financial net benefit to the local authority.<\/p><p> I put forward my amendment in conjunction with my colleague who represents the area to ensure there is independence.  One of the reasons given for designating Fingal County Council as the competent authority as opposed to other entities such as the Commissioner for Aviation Regulation, CAR, and the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, was the council's capacity to build a Chinese wall and have a dedicated, independent body operating within the organisation.  For this reason, we have tabled specific amendments on this matter to ensure there is independence.<\/p><p> I ask the Minister to indicate what will be done to ensure the necessary expertise and capabilities will be acquired, sourced or recruited for Fingal County Council.<\/p><p>What structure does he envisage within Fingal County Council if this legislation is passed?  Time is of the essence in this matter and that is the fault of the Minister and the Government rather than anyone on this side of the room.  We have a responsibility to ensure that a robust and independent regulatory regime is put in place to facilitate the sustainable growth of a major strategic economic hub on which tens of thousands of people within the constituency in which the airport is located and much further afield depend for their livelihood and income.  We depend on the airport to grow in order to facilitate further connectivity and our tourism industry.

It is a small economic regulatory body responsible for determining the maximum level of charges which may be charged at Dublin Airport.  It has no expertise or statutory remit in regard to environmental noise, environmental protection or planning and development, all of which issues are critical elements of the Bill.  Furthermore, it has no current capacity to or experience of running the type of extensive public consultations required by regulation 598.  Importantly, it does not have the organisational capacity to absorb a substantive new function within a relatively short timeframe.  It is a small economic regulator with some additional consumer protection functions and has approximately 20 staff.  It simply is not currently equipped to undertake the role of noise regulator within any reasonable timeframe.<\/p> <p>  The Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, was also considered as an option.  It has a statutory remit in regard to environmental protection.  It has an oversight role in terms of ensuring compliance by State bodies under the environmental noise directive in respect of noise maps and noise action plans produced by local authorities.  It is the considered view that the regulatory requirements under regulation 598 are very different to the licensing, audit and inspection role of the EPA.  The role under regulation 598 would represent a step change from what it is currently set up to do.<\/p> <p>  On Second Stage I addressed the decision to appoint Fingal County Council to this role and outlined the reasons I believe the council is the best fit.  I will briefly reiterate those points for clarity.  There is significant overlap between regulation 598, the planning process and environmental protection requirements.  In that respect, Fingal County Council is well suited to the job in light of its extensive experience in planning and development, land use planning and management, appropriate assessment, environmental impact assessment and managing large public consultations.<\/p><p>Providing the council with additional legal powers to regulate noise at Dublin Airport builds on its functions relating to noise under the environmental noise directive, END, and the planning code generally.  As will be discussed further under section 5 of the Bill, Fingal County Council will impose a levy on the DAA to cover the costs of carrying out its functions under this Act.  This will allow the council to bring in the expertise necessary to make evidence-based regulatory decisions on the most appropriate measures to be imposed at the airport.  It will also allow it to build upon its in-house capacity.  The decision of the noise regulator will be open and transport, subject to appeal and judicial review.  I am satisfied that the proposal on the implementation of EU Regulation No. 598\/2014 is wholly aligned with the long established multifunctional role played by all local authorities and, in my view, Fingal County Council is the most suitable body to take on this role.<\/p><p> I will answer the question posed by Deputy Troy because it took a slightly different line than seeking to have a different regulator.  I understand the Deputy is concerned to make sure the regulatory process is robust, rigorous and immune from any inappropriate outside influence.  I share his concern and recognise that he has consistently pursued this objective.  In some ways, he has bane of my life for the past 18 months.  The Deputy can be assured that I posed the same questions to my officials.  The matter has been subjected to serious and rigorous examination, including legal examination.  The conclusion is that the current provisions in the Bill are sound and meet the requirements the Deputy addressed.<\/p><p> Fingal County Council will establish a new, well resourced and dedicated aircraft noise regulation office within the executive branch, which will include the appropriate noise expertise sought by the Deputy.  The office will be headed at a senior level by a director of services with all of the appropriate arrangements to ensure decisions are taken fully in accordance with the law, as happens in planning and development, for example.  The Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government recently gave sanction to Fingal County Council to take on up to nine permanent staff for its new office.  I am confident that the council will have all of the tools at its disposal to reach a decision in line with EU Regulation No. 598\/2014.  The legislation sets out the legal framework that the noise regulator will need to work to.  It is a matter for Fingal County Council to determine how best to administer that function.<\/p><p> I will respond to members' specific questions which share a common theme.  While I do not want to repeat myself, I am happy to do so.  Deputy Munster said that Fingal County Council is not independent and she seemed to indicate that the IAA was the preferred and original choice.  She also claimed that this has been a rushed job.  That is a fair comment in many ways.  We are absolutely satisfied that Fingal County Council will be independent.  We have examined the independence of the council.  I understand Dublin Airport accounts for 7% of its income and we are perfectly happy with that percentage.  That decision or verdict of independence is supported by the Government's legal adviser, namely, the Attorney General.  I remind members of one important fact.<\/p><p>It was the Attorney General's office that decided that the IAA was not independent.  That was the problem.  Presumably using the same criteria, which it obviously has, to judge the independence of the IAA and Fingal County Council, it has decided that the council is independent.  I cannot take higher or more compelling advice.  The Attorney General's legal advice is something of which we have to take heed.  Were we to defy it in any way, members would be the first people to come to me and say doing so was reckless.  The Attorney General has said that Fingal County Council is independent.  Even Opposition Members must consider that a serious point.<\/p><p> Deputy Munster said this was a rushed job.  I accept fully the criticism that it has taken too long.  I will put my hands up - the problems involved were not necessarily of my making, but I take responsibility for them.  That this has taken too long has been the result of various legal advices and other matters.  However, having been criticised for two and a half years for this taking too long and, after accepting that perfectly legitimate criticism and making haste in response, it is difficult to now be told it is a rushed job.  We are in haste and we want to get this Bill through quickly.  We are late.  It is important for many reasons that the Bill be expedited.  I am grateful to the committee members for at least assisting in that and giving plenty of time for a valuable debate on the merits of whichever body they believe would best be the competent authority.<\/p><p> I have probably dealt with the issue of independence that Deputy Daly raised, although I am sure she does not agree with me.  She referred to our \"somersault\".  It was good rhetoric, but what we have done is make a decision on the back of legal advice that the IAA was not the right body and then moved on to what we now believe is a very good body to do this work.  We are accepting the legal advice that was given in that regard.<\/p><p> The Deputy referred to EU member states.  Ireland is in line with other member states in its choice of competent authority.  Member states are notable for the diversity of their competent authorities.  I can see no formula, template or common theme.  There are five or six categories from which such authorities have been chosen.  The Deputy is correct in much of what she said.  For example, yet to designate are Belgium and Spain.  They will do so shortly, but we do not know which way they will go.  France and Romania have designated multiple bodies.  A government department has been designated by Austria, Greece, Hungary, Luxembourg and the Netherlands.  The aviation authority has been designated by the Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, Italy, Latvia, Poland, Portugal and Sweden.  Probably because the regulation is qualified by the numbers involved, it does not apply to Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Estonia, Lithuania, Malta, Slovakia and Slovenia.  In common with us, Germany and the UK have designated local or regional authorities, so we are not an outrider completely.  There is great variety.  I do not know enough about the situation to know why every country chose particular bodies, but I expect those countries were considering the same criteria as us.  Their various bodies have different levels of independence.  To say that we are on our own is not true.  Germany and the UK have made similar decisions.<\/p><p>The rate base is 7% of Fingal's income.  Deputies Daly and Coppinger talked about the Environmental Protection Agency.  The EPA was consulted.  I do not know about freedom of information data.  It is useful to have it but the agency was consulted.  I can assure Deputies of that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTS2019011600002#O00700","speaker":"1213","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1547631000,"counter":976,"content":"<p>Is the Minister saying the agency was consulted?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTS2019011600002#R00200","speaker":"1434"},{"type":"speech","time":1547631000,"counter":977,"content":"<p>It was.

There was certainly communication with all those bodies.<\/p> <p>  I wish to respond to Deputy Brendan Ryan, who made the same point about the lack of independence or not being independent enough.  I hope I have answered that by saying that we have taken opinion on the matter from outside the Department, in particular, from the Office of the Attorney General.  It is important that we should get that from the office that rejected the proposal relating to the Irish Aviation Authority.<\/p> <p>  There is a common theme running through much of what people have said to the effect that I should take on board what people are saying.  I wish to say one thing that is important.  I absolutely commend Deputies Daly, Troy, Coppinger and Munster for what they are doing in representing the residents.  That is a useful and effective democratic procedure.  Undoubtedly what they have said has had an effect on the Bill.  However, I do not accept in any sense the criticism that I have ignored local residents.  My guess is that no Minister would have met more local residents.  I have not met them all - there are many groups - but I have met a vast number of residents from the areas involved as well as various delegations that Deputies have asked me to meet.  These are not people in my constituency but from north Dublin.  I welcome that and I have taken those views on board.<\/p> <p>  I have asked the DAA in various circumstances to meet these people and to take into account various points of view.  I believe it is the right thing to do.  It has taken some time and it has been useful but it is what a Minister ought to do and it is reflected in the Bill.  The points of view of residents are paramount and have to be taken into account.  There must be a balanced approach of course.  The idea that this has been done in any way regardless of their views or the real fears, difficulties and problems this may entail for them is not true.  They have had a welcome audience.  I have no wish to make this into some sort of pious statement.  There may be one or two whom I have not met but I have met a great many.  I have met several delegations and I have not been reluctant to meet them at all.  I hope that is reflected in everything I have been saying and in the Bill.

Let us look back on the reasons the IAA was not permitted.  It was because the authority failed the independence test.<\/p><p>I had asked the Minister to confirm whether legislation was being drawn up to break up the IAA.  I refer to the independence of the IAA in safety regulation.  If it is not appropriate in the case of the IAA and civil aviation regulation, why should it be allowed in the case of Fingal County Council and noise regulation?  The Minister also said that the CAR would not be equipped to take on the role of regulator and that there was no expertise.  Those same things, however, could be said of Fingal County Council.  Returning to the making of the decision, it was rushed into because of the circumstances.  It was an 11th hour decision to appoint Fingal County Council, but it also does not have the required in-house expertise.  At an earlier meeting, one of the Minister's colleagues mentioned about having to seek and bring in outside expertise.  It was also mentioned that nine permanent staff would have to be recruited to deal with this.<\/p><p> The other issue I want to take up also goes back to independence being the key.  People are looking for that and for transparency in decision-making right across the board.  That is all that communities are looking for.  They are looking for safeguards so that they can feel confident that their issues and concerns about health and well-being will all be considered independently and in a very transparent way.  The Minister referred to 7% of the income from Fingal County Council.  That is not small change in respect of the budget.  It is a substantial part of the budget of a council of the size of Fingal and yet it is being brushed off as something and nothing, as if it were spare change.  The key aspect here is independence and people do not have confidence that Fingal County Council has the required ability, expertise or, in particular, independence in decision-making.  Therein lies the problem.  There is no other reason for choosing Fingal County Council than the Minister getting into a tizzy when he realised the IAA was not suitable.  It was the 11th hour and he went with it.  People have a serious issue with that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTS2019011600002#R01500","speaker":"1333","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1547631000,"counter":991,"content":"<p>Deputy Coppinger has indicated and then Deputy Clare Daly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTS2019011600002#S00200","speaker":"1329"},{"type":"speech","time":1547631000,"counter":992,"content":"<p>On the competent authority which could best provide the kind of service we are referring to in respect of noise, the reason I put in the EPA is because it currently does noise mapping.  If we go onto the EPA website now, <i>www.epa.ie<\/i>, and then click into EPAMaps, it can be seen that in Tyrrelstown, which I looked up because it is a community very near me, the noise level during the day is 55 to 59 decibels.  It is in that contour.  The World Health Organization, WHO, recommendation is actually 45 decibels, so that is exceeding it.  Hollywoodrath, the new estate that people are going to be moving into very shortly and which councillors saw fit to put on the fringe of the airport with its associated noise level, already has a noise level of 60 to 64 decibels during the day.  Again, the WHO recommendation is 45 decibels.  At night, Tyrrelstown's noise level is between 50 to 54 decibels when the WHO recommends a level of 40 decibels.  I am giving those data because I could not have got them anywhere else except the EPA.  It seems bizarre that anyone could speak at a Joint Committee on Transport, Tourism and Sport and state that the EPA could not be considered to do this while it seems well positioned to do it, with extra resources and expertise.

He continued by stating that he supposed that was because of its inability to step up to the plate.

I am seeking a brief comment on the Fianna F&aacute;il proposal.  I do not think that does it.  It does not deliver the independence required.<\/p> <p>  I have argued about the lack of independence of Fingal County Council but I did not mention anything about the income from rates.<\/p><p>I made my argument based on the content of the regulation.  I read out Article 3.2 and Deputy Clare Daly read out Article 13.  Do the words contained in the regulation not have any meaning?  We read the words.  We are reasonably intelligent people and can say that words mean something.  The Minister's response is that everything is grand, but we are specifically referring to words in the regulation.  They must have meaning.  They refer to functional separation and being independent of the people who are affected.  If those words have no meaning, the Minister's response earlier regarding the balanced approach will have no meaning either because he is relying on definitions relating to the balanced approach in the regulation.  We are directly citing the words contained in the regulation yet the Minister is dismissing them as if they do not exist.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTS2019011600002#T01500","speaker":"1301","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1547631000,"counter":1009,"content":"<p>I have a question about something that is unclear.

It may be shocking for people but it is not surprising in the context that we know the Minister and the Cabinet made the decision to appoint Fingal County Council prior to the enactment of this legislation.  It is a matter we have discussed before.  I have put it to the Minister that designating Fingal County Council as the competent authority, in advance of the Oireachtas approving it, is a pretty dodgy course of action to take, particularly when he does not have a plan B.<\/p> <p>  The simple fact of the matter is that nobody agrees with the Minister&rsquo;s proposition to designate Fingal County Council as the competent authority for noise regulation in the airport.  Fianna F&aacute;il&rsquo;s attitude is a bit of a fudge.  Nobody has given the Minister everything he wants in terms of this.  The idea the recruitment for a unit has been sanctioned is not surprising.  What is more shocking about it is the level at which the Minister has pitched the recruitment grades.  It shows a total lack of understanding of what is necessary in terms of the technical expertise and ability of the people who will form the basis of this competent authority.<\/p> <p>  When I referred to a somersault earlier, the Minister replied that while that may be nice political rhetoric, it did not mean anything.  I put it to the Minister that it means quite a lot because it goes to the heart of the credibility of the information the Minister and his Department have given the committee and D&aacute;il over the past several years.  The Minister claimed he had taken this course of action because of legal advice.  Two years ago, having met the Attorney General who was a week away from finalising the seventh and hopefully last draft of the regulations, the Minister told me that there was broad agreement that the Irish Aviation Authority was best positioned to take on this role and to do it to the highest standard of professional competence.  He said it had a strong and internationally verified track record in the area of aviation security and inspection, functions for which it already had legal responsibility.  He also said making it responsible for noise regulation made sense.<\/p><p>That was discussed by the committee.  The previous Attorney General stated that the Irish Aviation Authority, IAA, is best placed to deal with this issue.  It is a bit like the point regarding the EPA and the freedom of information request made by a resident.  It gets to the accuracy of the information that is given.  At the heart of this matter is deciding when we can believe the Minister and when we cannot.  If some of the information which we have been given is easily contradictable, how can we accept anything we are told?  Which answer should be accepted?  That is at the heart of this issue.<\/p><p> The Minister stated that he has met many residents.  Obviously, we appreciate the meetings he attended with residents but we are not raising the issue just to kowtow to residents.  Many people in the communities we represent depend on the airport for their livelihood.  Some very capable people have given their professional as well as residential input on the arguments and the merits of the proposition before us.  It is not grandstanding.  Nobody agrees with the way in which the Government has set this up in terms of Fingal County Council being the competent authority.   The points made by Deputy Brendan Ryan will come back to haunt the Minister.  The Minister cannot demonstrate a functional separation and that will be open to legal challenge.  Even the proposed staffing levels serve to strengthen any potential legal challenge.  We are digging an enormous hole for ourselves in terms of how it is proposed that this will be done.<\/p><p> In response to queries on why other organisations were not selected, the Minister read to us the notes in that regard which we were given a couple of months ago.  We read those notes some time ago and did not agree with them.  The points made in that have been reflected upon by members of the affected communities as well as by Oireachtas Members.  The key point in regard to the Commission for Aviation Regulation, CAR, is exactly the point that has changed.  All the way along, everybody agreed the IAA is best placed in terms of aviation regulation.  At the 11th hour, the Government decided there might be a problem in terms of independence, so the IAA was axed from consideration.  That is where we were.  I referred the Minister to the level of expertise within the IAA.  It still has that expertise but the game changer is that it is being moved and split and the regulatory functions for aviation will be held by a new aviation regulator.  That is the key issue but the Minister did not address it.  The 2017 annual report of the IAA confirms that this idea was being looked at.  In the report the IAA pledged to work with the Department throughout 2018 to make this aviation regulatory function a reality.  On the previous occasion I raised it with the Minister, he assured me that it is well under way.  If it is not progressing quickly enough, that is not the fault of the Opposition or the people who will live with this decision for decades to come.  The process was under way but the Minister has not reflected that in the argument.<\/p><p> I agree that the EPA would be a better fit for the role than Fingal County Council as it is responsible for mapping noise, but it does not have any aviation expertise in terms of taking the balanced approach necessary in tackling the sources of noise.  The CAR would be better placed as regulator because it has expertise in all of the aviation rules and procedures except noise.  The Minister should not rule it out because it does not have noise expertise and then justify the selection of Fingal County Council by reference to its using the levies it will receive from the Dublin Airport Authority, DAA, to acquire the necessary expertise.  The proposed staffing arrangements will not provide the necessary expertise.  I do not know why nine people are needed at lower grades.  Rather, a couple of highly skilled people at far more technical grades are required.<\/p><p> There is a real problem here.  We must cut to the chase.  It comes down to Fianna F&aacute;il.  Deputy Troy is correct.  He has consistently raised this issue with the Government in recent years, pointing out that the regulation must be implemented and why Fingal County Council is not suitable to be responsible for that implementation.<\/p><p>What Fianna F&aacute;il is proposing will not provide adequate protection.  It is not functionally separate enough.  I know that is what Deputy Troy is attempting to do, but even if the function of separation were there, it would not be sufficient.  There is not sufficient work in a stand-alone capacity for nine people, and certainly not at that level.  Much of the time they would not have anything to do.  It fits in more with aviation in that it is not a nine to five, 365 day a year briefing for this role, so if it were to be set up in that way, there would not be sufficient meat, as it were, to attract people of sufficient capabilities.  That would be a real problem.<\/p><p> The Minister did not answer the point about the other countries because he repeated back to me the points I had made, thus avoiding the principal point that no other jurisdiction has brought it in the way that we have.  Britain and Germany have not brought it in the way that we have.  What they have is either a local or a regional authority being set up, and let us face the fact that a German regional authority is bigger than Fingal County Council.  In each and every case, however, the Minister for transport of various state departments is also involved in the process and is part of the competent authority.  There is not one local authority on its own.  Therefore, no Administration has brought it in the same way that Ireland has and that point has not been answered yet.<\/p><p> We are looking for information and concrete answers to questions that are being raised here.  It is not just that we are representing the residents' views or providing rhetoric.  We are not getting the proper and accurate answers on this and it is not our fault that the rush is on now because the preparation was inadequate to begin with.  We are in a difficult situation and this stage of the process can be difficult for people to understand because there are not many votes and maybe we need to explain how that works because it is a bit confusing.  We are trying to move the debate on because the general points have been well articulated.  Most members do not agree with Fingal County Council and nobody outside of the Minister and presumably Fine Gael agrees with what the Minister is doing.  If that is accepted, then the alternative has to be looked at and the Minister has not listened to that.  That is what we are here to do-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTS2019011600002#V01700","speaker":"1259","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1547631000,"counter":1033,"content":"<p>That is what this debate is about-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTS2019011600002#X00200","speaker":"1329"},{"type":"speech","time":1547631000,"counter":1034,"content":"<p>But the problem is that for the Minister to come back with points that have been raised months ago and rehash those does not bring the argument on and he does not demonstrate that he is listening to what members have said and making adaptations based on that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTS2019011600002#X00300","speaker":"1259"},{"type":"speech","time":1547631000,"counter":1035,"content":"<p>In fairness to the Minister, he has answered openly every question he has been asked openly, and there is also Report Stage of the Bill, regardless of what happens today, so there are many opportunities for members to express their views and to get answers to questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTS2019011600002#X00400","speaker":"1329"},{"type":"speech","time":1547631000,"counter":1036,"content":"<p>I refer to the recruitment and the indication that sanction for it has been given.

This is time-sensitive, and the reason it is time-sensitive is because of the procrastination by the Minister over the last two years.  We want to take this Bill and improve it.  That is why we have put forward amendments in that regard.  Listening to the Minister's reply in the last few minutes I have concerns about the level of expertise of the staff members that have been sanctioned by the Department.

The Minister is the person responsible for this piece of legislation.<\/p> <p>  I acknowledge that these members of staff have been sanctioned.  That is fine.  They have not been recruited.  However, I am concerned with the grade of staff that is being sanctioned.  In my initial contribution I asked the Minister to outline clearly how we could have confidence that the staff that would be made responsible for conducting and implementing this regulation would have the necessary expertise and qualifications.  The Minister is talking about planners and engineers.  I have concerns about that and I hope the Minister can clarify that.<\/p> <p>  It is also worth noting, and it has not been acknowledged by the Minister or indeed by any speaker, that there is an appeals mechanism here.  The appeals mechanism is An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  Ultimately Fingal County Council is not going to be the final decision-maker.  There will be an appeals mechanism, that is, An Bord Plean&aacute;la, and a further appeals mechanism by way of judicial review.  We do not want to have to go that far.  We reluctantly acknowledge given the work that has been done in relation to Fingal County Council, that independence can be established by creating a body within Fingal County Council by creating a directorate there which is not answerable to anybody else, which can act independently and which must have the required expertise, skill and knowledge to ensure that this EU regulation is implemented to the letter of the law.<\/p><p>The director would also ensure a balanced approach, that the residents&rsquo; concerns were addressed and that noise mitigation measures were implemented, while at the same time enabling the airport to grow and develop.  It is now at capacity and if we push this down the line, we will put its further development and jobs in the region at risk.

It shows a misconception or lack of understanding and is more prevalent in the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government than the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport because, when we had briefings, the staff who attended from the Department responsible for the environment were saying the council could, of course, do as described, that it would receive a planning consideration and go to the Department responsible for roads or water services to get advice and factor it in.  It demonstrates a complete lack of understanding of the point to state a competent authority has the right, when the planning authority goes to it, to state, \"Thus far and no further.\"  The competent authority must be obeyed.  That the authority can be duly ignored by the planning system represents an unhealthy influence on the part of the Department responsible for the environment.  It actually undermines what should be the independent role of a noise regulator in that regard.  It is actually very unhelpful.<\/p> <p>  My other point is on the need.  It is the case that we need a competent authority.  That is absolutely true and we have long been campaigning to try to have one.  How time-sensitive is it and what would be the impact?  Who will suffer because of the delay?  The DAA, for example, is on record as stating it does not mind at all who the competent authority is as long as we get our act together and get the legislation through, thus providing for more clarity.  What we are saying strongly is that we all want to see legislation and see this process through, but we want to see it being set up on the right basis in order that we can do both.<\/p> <p>  A reply I received to a parliamentary question to the Minister in December referred to the plans for the new commission for aviation regulation.  It indicated that work was well under way.  It referred to a high-level project management board, to much due diligence work being done and to numerous working groups.<\/p><p>Discussions had begun with the trade union F&oacute;rsa.  It involved complex competencies but the Minister was looking at it.  There were a number of stages to be done but it was under way.  If we are doing the job we should be doing it right.  We need to do it right.  I appeal to Fianna F&aacute;il.  We can set up a competent authority, but let us set it up in the flipping right way because this is going to be in place for years to come.  That is important.  The Minister has not really addressed those points at all.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTS2019011600002#Z00500","speaker":"1259","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1547631000,"counter":1052,"content":"<p>Finishing up on the issue of where we all stand, my impression before Christmas was that all parties barring Fine Gael were putting it to the Minister that Fingal County Council was not appropriate, that it was important to have complete independence, and that we had to be honest with residents.  That does not now seem to be the case because if Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael vote for the Bill as it stands, the council will be the competent authority.  We have to be upfront with people that this is what is happening.  I hope that will change before Report Stage as a result of dialogue with the residents, but that is where it stands now.<\/p> <p>  Amendment No. 9, which Deputy Troy just mentioned, provides that the director of the aircraft noise regulator section of the council shall not be subject to the direction of any other person.  First, as Deputy Munster has said, the CEO is the top person in the council.  Not only that, but page 7 of the legislation itself makes it absolutely and abundantly clear that the \"the functions of the competent authority [...] shall be performed by the chief executive\".  The chief executive of the council will over-ride any other section in the council so Deputy Troy's amendment will do nothing to protect the regulator's independence.<\/p> <p>  On the issue of time, we absolutely agree that we do not want to delay necessary development but no matter whether one is recruiting for the council, the EPA or the Commission for Aviation Regulation, it takes the same amount of time so that argument is completely redundant.  The people with the necessary skills will need to be found regardless of which body is made the competent authority.  <\/p> <p>  Obviously Deputy Troy is the spokesperson for the biggest Opposition party and he has been doing the running all along, but there is no point doing the running and then falling back at the time when one is needed, that is, at the finish line.

That is prudent and a sensible thing to do in anticipation of what we expect to happen in order to introduce noise regulation.  It is not arrogance; it is just the approval of various posts which will require certain expertise.  It is very important to do that.

I do not think that will be a problem.  When the Deputy says that I have repeated answers I have produced before, if she asks the same questions she will get the same answers.  I do not mind if the Deputy wants to go over the old coals of this long saga time and time again, that is up to her, but she will get the same responses.  Those same responses are the same reasons there has been a delay and I will give those responses every time she asks the same question.  That is fine.  People should be reminded of the difficulties we have faced but the reasons for them will be consistent.<\/p> <p>  I was asked if the delay is time sensitive and of course it is.  We want to resolve the uncertainty that exists.  The Deputy is representing a large number of residents here today, some of whom are in the Public Gallery, and they are welcome, but we want to make sure that the difficulties and uncertainties which they face and are living through, and I apologise for the delays, are ended.  It is time sensitive and those residents should know exactly what the consequences of what we are doing will be for them and we are determined to do that.  There is a lot in this directive which is balanced and in which those residents should find reassurance.  There is no noise regulator there at all at the moment.<\/p> <p>  I wish to address what Deputy Troy said.  His amendment looks for a robust body and his concern for independence is one which we share.  I do not envisage any great difficulty with having a chief executive in that situation because of the safeguards which exist.  It would be extraordinary if the chief executive were to do anything to compromise the independence because of the transparency of the process.  That would obviously emerge immediately and the safeguards which are there in the appeals mechanism which we have already mentioned, the commitment to public consultation through the appeals and noise regulation process and the judicial review to which we referred are adequate safeguards to make sure the transparency and independence is there.  <\/p> <p>  I also wish to assure Deputy Troy that resources and expertise will be brought to bear and, if there are mistakes, the appeal process will catch them.  This is a very thorough process.<\/p><p>It is a long and arduous process and people will be complaining for a long time to come.  An Bord Plean&aacute;la has 18 weeks yet and there are four weeks for appeals, which is to protect residents and the consumer.  The length of time to make sure the process is transparent and thorough is built into the legislation.  That is why it is there.  It is irritating.  We have so many cases of An Bord Plean&aacute;la annoying people because of delays in its decisions but the flip side of that is that the public and all sorts of stakeholders are protected by this and everything is taken into account.  I do not think anybody needs to fear that the process is not transparent and full.  It will be very thorough and forensic.  <\/p><p> It provides for a new regulatory regime to assess, monitor and enforce noise management at Dublin Airport.  We have had various suggestions about the competent authority here today.  People have suggested the EPA; the Commission for Aviation Regulation, CAR; and the Irish Aviation Authority, IAA, in a post-split situation.  All of them have a bit to offer and all of them have merit but on balance, I am adamant that the best choice is Fingal.  I do not dispute that everything that has been said here today has merit but it is a bit more nuanced.  Fingal has a great deal of expertise.  Overall, it has greater expertise and there is a better case for it than there is for the others.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTS2019011600002#BB00400","speaker":"1213","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1547631000,"counter":1059,"content":"<p>Does Deputy Clare Daly wish to comment?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTS2019011600002#CC00200","speaker":"1329"},{"type":"speech","time":1547631000,"counter":1060,"content":"<p>The Minister made the point that if one asks the same question, one will get the same answer but the problem is that we have been asking some of the same questions and have got either no answer or contradictory answers.

Which one is the right answer when at various times, the Minister have given two diametrically opposed answers to the same question?  The point I made about the Minister referring to past information referred to his critique of the other agencies that might act as a competent authority and the briefing from his Department in November 2018 that he rehashed for us today when he dealt with points and dismissed the CER using the same line he took in November but where he failed to address the question he was being asked.  He has not reflected the fact that aviation regulation and the IAA's regulatory functions are being subsumed in this new CER and that this is the body we envisage would take ownership of all regulatory functions relating to aviation.  The Minister cannot have his cake and eat it.  He cannot say that he is sorry for delaying the Bill, that he knows he is partly responsible for that and that we must rush it now because we are all to blame.  We are not all to blame.

It is not that the Minister is dealing solely with the 2002 directive to which nothing has been added.

Is the Minister telling me that no other jurisdiction in the European Union has incorporated these guidelines in legislation or regulation?  I doubt that no country has done so.  Has the Minister examined the way in which the directive has been implemented in each jurisdiction?

When we made the point this morning, the Minister said that health is covered in the regulation anyway so there is no need for it and that was his first argument.  The Minister's other argument was that he will not add it in as part of this at this stage.  Those two points are, in part, contradictory.<\/p> <p>  It also comes back to the point I made earlier about cost-effectiveness.  For example, under the process of aircraft noise regulation, the Bill states, \"the competent authority shall ensure ... the Balanced Approach\" and it goes on, and takes into account the likely cost-effectiveness of the measure.  The Bill later states that the following combination of measures must be considered with a view to what is the most cost-effective.  All of these amendments are simply seeking to ensure that the impact on health is also factored into the considerations when the competent authority is adjudicating and implementing the balanced approach.  It is not tying their hands.  It is just saying they must be mindful in assessing whatever approach they adopt to include health as a consideration.<\/p> <p>  The Minister said he is going to come back in the context of Deputy Troy's amendment and the guidelines and maybe we can factor something in around that.  The point here, for all of these amendments, is we cannot have this Bill without any reference to health specified in it or any reference in it to the modern guidelines and best scientific advice, because the impetus behind this regulation is to deal with and restrict aviation practices and the noise they create to benefit the health of residents.  The idea that we could not put that somewhere in the Bill is mad.  I am not going to drone through the pages of other criteria that the competent authority has to take into account but it does not refer to health.

There are a whole number of different amendments in this and the health impact assessment is an add-in, something different, and it would obviously put a more considerable burden, as it were, on the competent authority in evaluating these measures.  I do not have a problem with that because, if they were really doing their job properly, carrying out an impact assessment from a health perspective, something we do not do enough in this country, would be precisely the type of impact assessment that should be done.  We are all used to environmental impact assessments but we are not so used to health impact assessments.  I realise that is raising the bar but that is appropriate in the context of this legislation, although I realise I am pushing the boundary on that.  I will park that for now, with the right to re-enter it, but, having genuinely said that, I do not accept what the Minister says about the other points on health.  We have been here for in the region of four hours, so maybe I am just not getting it.

I do not have it in the definitions either and I would need to have it in there.  While that is a whole new arena, mentioning health is not.  It is much more straightforward.  It is striking that every Opposition committee member has said clearly that they expect health and the guidelines to be factored in in some format when we get to Report Stage.

The legislation states only the airport authority may, by notice in writing given to the competent authority, request the competent authority to assess a noise issue.  I am looking to ensure the airport authority or any organisation or individual impacted on by airport noise would be able to approach the competent authority because as of now only the airport authority is allowed to initiate the process under EU Regulation No. 598.  The problem concerns the criteria.  On the one hand, the DAA may do so at its discretion.  That has to be changed.  What does &quot;may at its discretion mean&quot;?  What is the threshold?  What if the DAA decides not to go to the competent authority?  Who would stop it in that regard?  Why does the DAA have control over whether it should do so?  Should it not be mandatory?

I have always supported responsible and reasonable growth of the airport, which is very important.  Residents and people in north Dublin also support this.  As I said to the Minister during meetings of this committee in the summer, the airport is a major employer and investor and a crucial part of our national infrastructure.

The Minister talks about appeals processes as if everything that happens in the airport that has a noise implication goes through the planning process first, life goes on as normal and nothing happens outside either the noise plan that is produced every couple of years or the planning application when some major change is proposed and people have an input under Part 3 of the Act.  This legislation is about how the noise regulator does its job.  The Minister asks how the noise regulator would know whether there is an impact from noise.  At the moment, the Bill provides that the noise regulator can only intervene when the DAA goes to it.  There is no facility for a resident to do so.  What happens if there is a change to aircraft noise testing?  I live in River Valley and planes keep me awake at night.  There is no mechanism to address this because the matter falls outside the review that takes place every couple of years and the planning application.  I feel I am being negatively impacted by noise.  As this is specified, there is no route for me to go to the competent authority because the role of the competent authority is only to assess applications that come from the DAA, not from residents.

It would at least have to write back to the person making the application and let him or her know that the authority was not invoking the procedure for whatever reason.

Again, this is partially linked to the last amendment we dealt with a minute ago.

I am not sure if the Bill is doing what I thought it was doing.  To be honest, I found it hard to negotiate what was being said in it.  It appeared to me that it was providing an out.

It is suggested a measure would be deferred if not practical to implement.  How can we include a provision that stops the clause being used to delay and frustrate the implementation of a noise-mitigation measure?  I am seeking to include a provision meaning there cannot be a delay for ridiculous reasons, for example.  I was not entirely happy with my amendment.  I proposed the insertion of \"if immediate implementation is not possible\".  At all times we should be trying to have whatever decision the competent authority makes implemented immediately.  I am worried about a reference in the legislation to an ability to defer so I am trying to include something to cushion it by stating the only reason one might defer is if immediate implementation is not possible.  I did not know the correct technical term, or whether it should be \"possible\" or \"practicable\".  I am not sure but the amendments are trying to avoid what I describe.  I am not sure whether my amendments succeed or whether the Minister has others that might address the issue.

Obviously, the authority should have power where a measure requires a lead-in period but Deputy Brendan Ryan's point in this regard is exactly right in that if we are giving it the power of deferral, we have to include some caveats; otherwise it should not be given the power to defer because its job is supposed to be implementing noise-mitigation measures.  The Minister is the one who introduced the concept of deferring.  We are just trying to add safeguards, in a common-sense way.
