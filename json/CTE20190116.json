The board&rsquo;s remit is to design, build and equip the new children&rsquo;s hospital for the island of Ireland.  The proposed new children&rsquo;s hospital development is the most significant capital investment project ever undertaken in healthcare in Ireland, bringing together three children&rsquo;s hospitals in a modern custom-designed building to deliver the best care and treatments for Ireland&rsquo;s sickest children.<\/p> <p>  I was joined on the board by 11 other dedicated members with the collective skills and experience of major projects to deliver on the responsibility with which we were entrusted, namely, to build a world-class children&rsquo;s hospital on the site of St. James&rsquo;s campus.  The urgent need for a new children&rsquo;s hospital for the country has been recognised for decades.  Acknowledging the importance of the challenge ahead of us and the realisation that we were building a hospital that will care for sick children and their families for many generations to come, we set out a bold vision for the project.<\/p> <p>  The project aims to deliver one of the finest children&rsquo;s hospitals in the world and specifically a hospital that provides a truly supportive and therapeutic environment for children and their families.  It will also provide a safe and stimulating environment for staff, recognising the importance of wellness.  It will be a hospital sensitive to and positively enhancing of its urban setting and the quality of life of the local population.<\/p><p>Its layout, detailed design and construction quality will facilitate the optimum delivery of all aspects of leading current and developing clinical practice.  It will be a leading edge fully digital hospital.  It will be cost effective in terms of capital and whole-life costs, with sustainable solutions integrated into all stages of the project life cycle.  In that regard, we have targeted a Building Research Establishment environmental assessment method, BREEAM, rating of \"excellent\" and BER A3 standards.<\/p><p> On design team selection, with a clear vision for the project and an experienced executive team in place, the board put in place a structure and process for design team procurement, securing planning permission and the procurement of contractors to ensure the timely delivery of the new hospital, while working closely with St. James's Hospital in decanting buildings from the 12-acre site identified for the new children&rsquo;s hospital.  Following a comprehensive procurement process, we reached our first major milestone with the appointment of the design team in August 2014.  Thereafter, the design for planning was produced in a most expeditious manner.  A planning application was lodged in August 2015 and An Bord Plean&aacute;la granted planning permission in April 2016.  This represented the crossing of a major hurdle for the project in the light of the previous experience with the Mater site.  The decanting of buildings from the 12-acre site identified for the children's hospital commenced immediately and an enabling works contract focused on demolition commenced in July 2016.<\/p><p> Importantly, shortly after receipt of planning permission, the procurement process for contractors began in June 2016.  A procurement sub-group had earlier been established to define the most appropriate approach to contractor procurement.  The group included our board, HSE estates and members of the Government construction contracts committee.  Given the history of cost overruns and adversarial behaviour on public sector projects, it was decided to consider alternatives to the traditional form of tendering.  Reference was made to lessons learned and evolving best practice in the UK and internationally.  The universal challenge in all was to replace adversarial cultures with collaborative ones.  The construction of terminal 5 at Heathrow airport is held up as a prime example of collaborative working.  Prior to its construction, the British Airport Authority, BAA, conducted a two-year study in which every major UK construction project of over &euro;1 billion completed in the previous ten years was investigated.  The two main areas identified by the BAA as contributing to the general poor performance across all projects were a lack of collaboration among project partners and the clients' reluctance to assume responsibility for project risk.<\/p><p> The procurement model for the national children's hospital had to align with EU procurement rules and work closely with established government construction contract forms.  Following deliberations over several months, which included presentation of the proposed option to the Government construction contracts committee, the strategy group recommended a two-stage tender process for procurement of contractors.  This process was and remains the accepted best international practice for procurement of large-scale complex projects such as the children's hospital.  Among the clear and defined benefits of the two-stage approach are that it attracted the desired calibre and number of local and international contractors to bid competitively for the project and it enabled tendering to occur prior to the completion of full detailed drawings for phase B, meaning that phase A construction could start two years earlier than if a traditional procurement strategy was deployed, thus allowing the bulk of costs to be secured at 2016 levels, that is, when they were tendered.  It also facilitated early involvement by contractors in the design development process, with critical input on buildability, contractor and supply chain integration, risk management and innovation resulting in the completion of a fully integrated design.  Critically, prior to commitment of expenditure on the main building works there is now certainty on cost and programme, with client and contractor risks reduced or eliminated.  The programme includes delivery of a fully commissioned and quality assured building.  The two-stage tender process has and will continue to foster a collaborative culture, eliminating traditional adversarial and opportunistic behaviour.<\/p><p> Stage 1 of the two-stage tender process involved the works being bid oon on the basis of a preliminary design and an approximate itemised bill of quantities based on that design.  The contractors provided rates for all elements of the works.  Stage 2 included the designers and contractors working together to develop the design to completion.  The tendered rates were then applied to the final bill of quantities produced by our quantity surveyor.  The actual cost is determined by multiplying the final quantities by the tendered rates.  Where there is disagreement between our quantity surveyor &ndash; Linesight &ndash; and the contractors, it is resolved by the independent expert whose decision is binding on both parties.<\/p><p> Following our meeting in November 2018, the board made a recommendation to the HSE and the Department of Health that the works should proceed as set out in the agreed tender process and that BAM should be instructed to proceed with phase B, the main building works.<\/p><p> I will go through some of the detail on the cost but we can go into greater detail later on.  I will switch the two around in the sense that I will deal first with the construction costs at a high level.  The sum of &euro;570 million, which was included in the approval of the overall &euro;983 million in early 2017, increased by &euro;320 million up to &euro;890 million.  As I mentioned earlier, we had targeted savings of &euro;66 million.  At the end of the day we achieved &euro;20 million.  That added &euro;46 million to the project.  Statutory issues, such as fire regulations following the Grenfell fire and additional sprinklers, added &euro;27 million to the project.  Engagement with clinicians on the final design added a further &euro;21 million.  Between those three elements, &euro;94 million was added to the figure of &euro;570 million.  In essence, the result of the stage 2 process, that is, the design and development element, accounted for an additional &euro;94 million.  There were omissions in the design at tender stage that were brought into the final design during the design and development process at a cost of &euro;20 million.  The impact of the nine-month extension of the programme and the additional scope added &euro;90 million.  Then, as happens in construction contracts, there were additional claims from the contractors to reflect the changes in scope.  At the end of the day, through the intervention of the independent expert, they were settled and agreed at &euro;22 million, which takes us up to &euro;890 million.  We can go into greater detail on that later.  <\/p><p> As well as an increase in construction costs of &euro;320 million, there were additional costs of &euro;130 million.  These included &euro;50 million in VAT, additional costs on the satellite centres at Tallaght Hospital and Connolly hospital, staff, site supervision, design team, medical equipment and risk and contingency costs.  The final project cost is now &euro;1.433 billion, which is &euro;450 million higher than the figure of &euro;983 million approved by the Government in 2017.<\/p><p> Following the Government's approval of the investment decision, the phase B works and the main building works have now been instructed to BAM, with construction works of the main hospital on the St. James's Hospital campus to be completed in mid-2022.  Close to the end of my submission I address benchmarking.  In early 2014, the paediatric hospital board prepared a preliminary budget.  That is detailed on slide 11.  It showed project costs of &euro;800 million.  This was based on advice from AECOM, the quantity surveyors for the Mater children's hospital proposal.  The estimate included construction costs of &euro;2,500 per square metre, which was the appropriate cost at the time.  We were in a deep deflationary period at the time.  We allowed an inflation allowance of 3% per annum in accordance with the trend at the time.  In the AECOM estimate, which totalled &euro;800 million, there was an overall cost of &euro;2,875 per square metre.  An international benchmarking report completed by AECOM in October 2018 concludes that the average construction cost for an international hospital project similar to the national children's hospital is now &euro;5,951 per square metre, more than twice the estimated cost of construction in 2016.  Indeed, this is borne out by information from the industry on the decade up to 2022, which indicates that construction costs for large, complex projects in the Dublin area will have increased by up to 100%.<\/p><p> The cost per square metre for the children's hospital is &euro;6,500.<\/p><p>It is above the average of &euro;5,951 per sq. m but not above the maximum costs.<\/p><p> The timeline to deliver the new children's hospital from the appointment of the board in August 2013 to project completion in mid-2022 is a total of nine years.  I am satisfied that the board and executive team have set about the task in a competent and professional manner, putting in place the most appropriate structures and processes based on best international practice.  If we were to start again on a project of this scale and complexity we would adopt the same procurement approach.  Notwithstanding this we are deeply disappointed and acknowledge the very significant cost increases and the challenges these pose.  There are lessons to be learned regarding the wisdom of pursuing cost reductions on competitive tenders and ensuring the sufficiency of tender information, in particular, mechanical and electrical services at tender stage.  This would have ensured a more accurate prediction of actual quantities and costs at the tender stage and, to a large extent, would have reduced the under-estimation of costs at stage 1.<\/p><p> With cost and programme certainty now achieved, our focus is on ensuring that all parties work safely and collaboratively and deliver a hospital of outstanding quality in a project of which we all will be proud, namely, one of the finest children&rsquo;s hospitals in the world providing unsurpassed care for the nation&rsquo;s sick children for generations to come.  At the same time, we are mindful of the Government's concerns to ensure the project is indeed delivered within the agreed time and within the revised budget.  We welcome the planned independent review of board&rsquo;s processes and procedures.  Any issues identified will be dealt with speedily and comprehensively in the interests of successful completion of the project and the effective management of public funds.<\/p><p> I thank the members of the committee for their attention and my colleagues and I will be delighted to answer any questions they might have. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019011600002#H00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tom Costello","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1547629200,"counter":12,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Costello.  Will he explain why these overruns were not anticipated?  Was it a fault in procurement, tendering or both?  An expression of deep disappointment does not reflect the frustration and anger felt by this committee over what has happened.  We want to find out who was responsible for these failures as this is an unprecedented overrun in one of the largest infrastructural developments in Ireland.  The consequences of these overruns are not confined to the national children's hospital, but will have knock-on effects in all capital investment in our health service over coming years, including the National Maternity Hospital, the national forensic hospital, the National Rehabilitation Hospital, the building of elective-only hospitals as identified by Sl&aacute;intecare, the primary care programme and the replacement of equipment, which is necessary in all our hospitals, as well as the transitional funding that will be required to develop Sl&aacute;intecare reform.  It is not only a question of an overrun in the children's hospital, as it will be extremely damaging to all capital investment of the next few years.  Therefore, I would like Mr. Costello to answer why these overruns were not anticipated.<\/p> <p>  Second, what has the board identified as the premium for building the hospital at the St. James's site rather than a greenfield site?  There is obviously a huge cost in decanting buildings, as Mr. Costello described it, and demolition before construction was to take place.  <\/p> <p>  Third, why has the cost exceeded the international average and become the most expensive children's hospital in the world and one of the most expensive hospitals in the world?  What factors have led to that overrun?  Why were they not anticipated?  There are knock-on effects that will affect our health service.

It is likely that building costs will have increased by up to 100%.  We set out on a journey.  We had a deliberate approach in how we structured the project.<\/p><p>The two-stage tender process was internationally regarded as the best approach, whereby one goes to the market with a preliminary design and every element of the project identified but the quantities not finalised.  We went through the process and I earlier went through the advantages of going this route.  These are advantages which have accrued now and will in the future so that we are now at a stage whereby, through that process, we now have firm price and programme certainty.<\/p><p> I mentioned there were two issues in terms of lessons learned around seeking to get cost reductions when there was a competitive tender process.  In hindsight, there was pressure on the budget, mainly driven by tender price inflation, and pressure to reduce the costs.  People must remember that it is a huge project.  It is one of the most expensive hospitals in the world but it is also one of the biggest children's hospitals in the world.  It is important to remember that and because it is big, it is extraordinarily complex.  People might walk into a room and say a room is a room but the infrastructure behind the delivery of that room to deliver a fully digital hospital is absolutely enormous.  At the early stage of the design, the complexity of those services and the quantities involved were not fully recognised within the early stage tender.  That became clear as the design developed over 2018.<\/p><p> It is important to remember that the quantities that are now applied to the rates we got in 2016 are the quantities that are required to deliver the project.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019011600002#M00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tom Costello","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1547629200,"counter":15,"content":"<p>My question was why those were not anticipated.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019011600002#N00200","speaker":"1275"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1547629200,"counter":16,"content":"<p>It is a complex project.

It is now fully defined and, when we learned of the large increase, we sought an outside review to consider if we had over-designed the building.  The feedback at the end of that exercise was that the building is fit for purpose for a modern, fully digital hospital.  The quantities that have come out of that two-stage process are applied to the rates we got at tender in 2016 and that gives us the final cost.  Does that deal with that question?  In fairness, it is complex and difficult to understand because of the quantum but that is the nature of it.

These are costs that would have occurred on any site.  For example, statutory issues arose around sprinklers and the Grenfell Tower fire and we had to comply with those changing regulations.<\/p><p> Regarding omissions in the bill of quantities, the scale and complexity of this job is that it has an area of 158,000 sq. m, which is the size of Dundrum Shopping Centre, and within those 158,000 sq. m, there is a great deal of complexity with the 6,000 rooms and the level of services involved.  Mr. Costello has spoken about the digital hospital.  This is the first public digital hospital in Ireland and that comes with cost impacts.  People might ask what is meant by a digital hospital.  It means that we no longer rely on paper records.  Everything is digitised.  We have electronic healthcare records so clinicians will use their iPads and tablets to connect with records.  Every piece of equipment requires an interface with the electronic healthcare records so everything is stored centrally.  That has an enormous impact for the design of the building to ensure there is resilience built into the hospital.  If the IT systems crashed the entire system would go down, whereas in the old days one might have lost a piece of paper.  In all the 6,000 rooms there are multiple data points for pieces of equipment and for staff to connect to, but each of those data points is replicated in case something goes down.  There is an A and a B.  They must go to a separate computer room rather than to the same computer room in case a computer room fails.  They also each need a separate power supply and back-up generator.  There is a huge amount of resilience and duplication in a digital hospital.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019011600002#N01000","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Pollock","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1547629200,"counter":25,"content":"<p>Why would that not have been anticipated in the original design, procurement and tendering?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019011600002#O00200","speaker":"1275"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1547629200,"counter":26,"content":"<p>The user engagement piece that we set out on day one in terms of getting on the site two years earlier than with our traditional procurement model was that we engaged with the users and we took typical rooms.

The highest cost of the hospitals was &euro;8,000 per square metre.

The original bid from BAM came in at about &euro;640 million.  When the dust has settled, I do not think we are going to see any change from much less than &euro;2 billion.  When this is all done, I think the overspending will be somewhere between &euro;1 billion and &euro;1.5 billion - and it could be higher.<\/p> <p>  The fiscal space for the entire country last year was less than a billion euro.  Think of the work, the analysis and the oversight involved in deploying that &euro;800 million, or so, while Mr. Costello and his team in St. James's Hospital were spending more than that.  As the Chair said, a Cabinet memo from December began to outline the costs of that.  What will not happen includes additional hospital beds, new emergency cancer and cardiac facilities, primary care facilities, long-term residential units, accommodation in the community for people with disability, new laboratories, new operating theatres, investment in paediatric blood services, the second catheterisation laboratory in Waterford, a new emergency department and cystic fibrosis facilities at Beaumont Hospital and no development of appraisals and early planning for Sl&aacute;intecare capacity projects until 2022 at least.  <\/p> <p>  That is the reality of the incompetence and failure that I think we are seeing from Mr. Costello and his board in respect of the financial control of this project.  He keeps talking about a figure of &euro;890 million.  The figure the Taoiseach gave to the D&aacute;il was &euro;1.433 billion and the memo which the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, presented to Cabinet referred to &euro;1.73 billion.  Can Mr. Costello tell us the total cost at this stage?  I am not interested in phase one and phase two, above ground or below ground, kit out or commissioning.  What will be the total cost to the State by the time the doctors, nurses and children actually get to walk into this hospital?  Is it the &euro;890 million that Mr. Costello keeps talking about, the &euro;1.4 billion to which the Taoiseach referred, the &euro;1.7 billion stated by the Minister for Health or, indeed, a higher figure than all of those?  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019011600002#P00300","speaker":"1436"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1547629200,"counter":35,"content":"<p>I will try to clarify that.  I respect the fact that it is perhaps confusing with so many numbers.  It is certainly complicated.

It does not include the satellite centres or design fees.

I do not accept the rationale for the benchmarking that has been used, according to which the cost of &euro;2,500 per square metre four years ago now stands at &euro;5,500 per square metre.  The only explanation the witnesses seem to have given is that it somehow has become twice as expensive to build in Dublin.  However, the site cost has not gone up because the State owned the site.  Bricks have not become twice as expensive in three years and labour wages have not increased by 300% in the past four years.  I do not accept this increase.  When this project is finished, the cost per bed to the State will be twice the cost of the most expensive hospital ever built anywhere in the world.

While Deputy Donnelly was teasing out the figures, it struck me that, whereas we all know that cost overruns can happen, in this case, the overruns are on a monumental scale.

The board seems to have great faith in their ability to deliver, notwithstanding that the costs keep increasing.<\/p> <p>  This question was asked previously but I want to get to the bottom of this matter.  In terms of the additional capacity for sick children, I fully appreciate and welcome that the hospital will have single occupancy rooms.  The Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation only started to count the number of children waiting on trolleys just over a year ago.  Its figures would lead us to believe we have a capacity problem, which we clearly have.  Is it the case that the sum total of additional beds being provided is four?  Will there be only four additional beds?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019011600002#T00400","speaker":"1302"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1547629200,"counter":104,"content":"<p>I am happy to answer that question for Deputy O'Reilly.  I agree with her that there are challenges in respect of the existing hospitals which are trying to accommodate and meet care needs.  I want to clarify that children's emergency medicine is different from adult services.  I know that, unfortunately, the reason all but one of the children who are waiting this morning are in the emergency department is isolation.  We have beds in the hospital but they are multiple-use beds and because these children have influenza and other infectious diseases we cannot place them in the wards.  There is an absolute crisis.  We need to get the hospital built as fast as possible because of the additional need for isolation specific to paediatric healthcare.<\/p> <p>  To answer the Deputy's question on the number being added to the existing bed base within the three children's hospitals, as a total number there will be 68 more beds.  It is important, however, to break down that figure in order that it is understood.  It is not just about numbers, but about the types of beds we are trying to introduce.  The most important figure relates to inpatient and day cases, for which there will be 44 beds.  Within that there are new beds for mental health and for children with eating disorders, of which we currently have none.  Most important, we will also have 60 critical care beds.  This will be the largest critical care unit on the island of Ireland.  It will provide paediatric critical care for all of the sickest children in Ireland.  It will provide the cardiac critical care for the whole of Ireland's services, because we are now providing cardiac services on an all-island basis.  It will also have neonatal intensive care and critical care beds.  That is a fundamental change.  The greatest challenge for us in paediatrics is dealing with critical care needs and getting really sick children transferred from the regions quickly when they need to be transferred.<\/p><p>There also are the isolation requirements.<\/p><p> As for what is new, another 24 beds are based within the paediatric outpatient urgent care centres and in the emergency department as short-stay beds.  We have demonstrated and already put them into Tallaght Hospital and we started to do so at Temple Street this year.  I can report that for the children waiting for emergency care, our access for admissions in 2017 and 2018 has consistently reduced throughout the TrolleyGAR system because of these new ways of working.  This hospital will address the critical need for isolation facilities for paediatric care, which has a greater demand for such facilities than in adult services.  This year, we will open up the services at Connolly Hospital Blanchardstown.  By July, we will have opened an urgent care centre and outpatient unit at the hospital.  It will be the first time that there will be paediatric services in north County Dublin that will meet the vast majority of the requirements for that population.  We have major pressures in this area, particularly at the facility at Temple Street, because 124,000 children avail of our paediatric emergency care facilities and 48,000 of them make use of the smallest unit at Temple Street.  We anticipate that from this year, the investment that has been made in paediatrics will bear fruit and reduce some of the pressures being experienced at Connolly hospital.<\/p><p> We are dealing with a different way of working on the part of GPs.  As we have demonstrated, by having short-stay beds we do not need to admit as many patients as at present and consequently, the initiative should help to alleviate any bed capacity issues.  The initiative will be rolled out in Tallaght Hospital next year and then it will be rolled out in the hospitals.  We have a highly integrated phased approach to how we are going to transform services for children, particularly in the areas of general paediatrics, trauma orthopaedics, in which we have seen significant improvements due to the investment that has been made in paediatrics, and of course urgent and emergency care.  In line with the rest of the system and the Sl&aacute;intecare report, we are increasing the bed capacity but we are doing so in a very niche way.  It is not the same old, same old.  We are identifying and future-proofing where we anticipate the future healthcare requirements are.   <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019011600002#T00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Eil&iacute;sh Hardiman","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1547629200,"counter":106,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Hardiman for her comments.

This was a major topic of conversation over Christmas and the new year when politicians have time to reflect and talk to people at length.  This will be a case study for years to come.  It will affect future projects, as the Chairman outlined, and it will have a considerable impact on future capital projects in health.  I was a member of the Government that made the decision to build the new children's hospital and it was the right decision.  I was a Minister of State when the then T&aacute;naiste, Eamon Gilmore, and then Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny, allocated approximately &euro;450 million for the project and I was part of the Government that made the decision to go ahead with the project.  I would not have been part of a Government that would have made a decision to go ahead with a new children's hospital for &euro;1.7 billion because the impacts on other health capital projects would have been so dramatic.

We must learn from it, but we must also have accountability, given the scale of the overrun.

It is not apples and apples and oranges and oranges, it is a completely different jurisdiction so there is no best practice.  This is the first time ever and to be frank, we obviously have failed massively.  There are learnings here but best practice does not cut it.

We have nine outpatient suites which are meeting that requirement.  Paediatrics has considerably less private practice than adult medicine.  I have to bow to Mr. Pollock, who knows what the construction contracts are.  However, that component is very small and it meets the contractual obligations we have in employing those consultants.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019011600002#DD00700","nonspeaker":"Dr. Emma Curtis"},{"type":"speech","time":1547629200,"counter":239,"content":"<p>Can Mr. Pollock indicate what the quantum is?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019011600002#DD00800","speaker":"1349"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1547629200,"counter":240,"content":"<p>My recollection is that it was about &euro;2 million.

The committee members have that.  Sharing that information is no problem.  With regard to how we deliver paediatric services, it is important to understand that the vast majority of the services we deliver are outpatient-based services and emergency and urgent care.  The committee will note that in the planning for this hospital we have seen significant increases in provision for outpatients.  We would have a total of 141 outpatient rooms.<\/p><p>They are spread between the outpatient centres in Connolly and Tallaght in addition to the new children's hospital.  The vast majority of services can and should be delivered in paediatrics on the same day through outpatient facilities.  Again, that reflects how we are moving, with Sl&aacute;intecare, to much more nurse-led and health and social care professional-led clinics, not just consultant-based clinics. <\/p><p> We have considered the activity and planning and projected the future requirements and we have mapped them into the particular rooms.  We can give the members a breakdown because the mapping is based on different specialties.  Let me give an example.  Some clinics usually involve once-off visits.  Some 25% of the population are children and because we are dealing with all those with the tertiary needs and those who require the high-end specialties, many have multiple appointments.  Sometimes they come to our hospitals and spend the whole day going between the various specialties.  The cystic fibrosis children take up the whole day in one room because we do not mix them with others for infection-control reasons.  Sometimes one child can take up a whole day in clinic.  The breakdown accounts for this.  The activity and planning analysis can map this.<\/p><p> It is important to note a children's hospital is different from an adult hospital and needs very many auxiliary supports.  We have facilities for parents to stay in the hospital close to the critical care, or what we call \"within dressing-gown distance\".  The mothers and fathers and other family members are with critically ill children and we need to support them.  This is different from other cases.<\/p><p> It is important to note that the hospital is to be the only one educating future healthcare professionals in paediatrics.  All the undergraduates in medicine and nursing and the health and social care professionals will be based there.  The hospital includes the education centres to facilitate this.  We have developed these with the universities.  All seven universities will have some association with the hospital.  That has to be taken into account.<\/p><p> One must consider the sheer volume of support required.  In our planning, we have prioritised to ensure that all the clinical requirements are met.  We have sought and optimised the support structure.  That was one of the benefits of being co-located on a large medical campus, namely, the 50-acre campus at St. James's.  We have managed to achieve some efficiencies in this regard through shared services.  We are utilising services that are for the whole of the campus and not just for the children's hospital.  We have actually built in capacity to take on the maternity hospital also.  All these factors need to be taken into account.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019011600002#DD01300","nonspeaker":"Ms Eil&iacute;sh Hardiman","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1547629200,"counter":246,"content":"<p>In fairness, trying to explain to the public that there are 6,000 rooms is the issue.

No more than the rules of EU procurement are very prescriptive, the rules around stage one and the bill of quantities, the development of the stage two process, and ultimately the finalisation of the contract price are also very prescriptive.  The revised quantity in the bill of quantities is prepared again not by the contractor but by our quantity surveyor.  The Senator will know that nowadays, with the benefit of building information modelling, BIM, and because of the complexity of this, the BIM model, in essence, takes the uncertainty out of it.  The BIM model will prepare the bill of quantities in association with our own quantity surveyor so there cannot be arguments over measurements because the BIM model verifies the quantities.

I welcome the witnesses and thank them for coming along this morning.<\/p> <p>  This project is an emotive project nationally among professionals and the general public.  Anybody who has spoken with the parents of sick children over the past 20 years will say always that there is a burning requirement for a modern hospital.  In fact, the argument and debate has taken place over the past 20 years with little progress.  I mention that as a backdrop to what we are talking about now.<\/p> <p>  Tendering, particularly in relation to inflation, is a sensitive issue at present.  It does not take too much inflation in a particular area to increase suddenly and dramatically the cost of a project.  There are one or two questions that I would put.<\/p> <p>  First, in the number of tenders received, will the witnesses remind me what was the difference between the lowest tender and the highest tender, and the extent to which the specification was observed in each?<\/p> <p>  Another question relates to the &euro;890 million plus the ancillaries that affect other locations and sites.  Is the cost likely to increase further under any of those headings and, if so, to what extent?  I refer to the &euro;1.4 billion eventual cost.  To what extent can the cost be retained at that?<\/p> <p>  It is &euro;890 million excluding VAT.  I thought there was a clause somewhere that VAT was not chargeable on some State projects.  How does that apply to this case?  If one is building local authority houses, it does not apply anyway.  Maybe we could get clarification.  How much would the VAT be?  I do not want to get a calculator.  It is not too difficult a job but it is a contributory factor.<\/p> <p>  Were the various bids in any way date conditioned?<\/p><p>In many cases it is usual to specify that a bid will last for a specified time and then there is a question of what it will cost after that time.<br\/><br\/>Is the project in accord with international norms regarding the specification for hospitals of different categories, A, B, or C, for instance?  I ask because if we want a state-of-the-art world-class hospital, and the parents of sick children want nothing less than a world-class hospital, then we must be careful not to dumb it down before it even starts and create a situation where we expect to get it for half price.  It will not work that way and we will not get what we are looking for, which is the highest possible standards of care for sick children in the future.<br\/><br\/>To what extent did the hospital's internal quantity surveyor and evaluation show any discrepancies?  Did a discussion take place <i>vis-&agrave;-vis <\/i>the various tenders?  Were they compared and if so, how?  Was it pointed out that tenders A, B, or C, had more or less than was required and so on?  <br\/><br\/>Was a request made or recognition given to the impact of inflation on various building works, whether it was in construction, electrical works or whatever and if so, what were they?  Were they marked as being of a particularly sensitive nature?  To what extent were they likely to change over a period of years?<br\/><br\/>How satisfied was the evaluation team that it was dealing with the best that could be done and that its efforts were not upstaged by any of the bodies involved seeking to increase the cost extent, scale or value of the project beyond what the board itself required?  <br\/><br\/>I am aware that since last July, the group has spent considerable time discussing what would be done next after it discovered the price overrun.  By what amount did it overrun in the period between July 2018 and November or December?  There definitely was an overrun during that period so was it wise to delay at that stage beyond acknowledging that there were cost increases in excess of what had been anticipated?<br\/><br\/>Were the cost levels anticipated at every level and potential increases identified at an early stage?  I refer especially to the lowest, middle and highest bids.  Is the board satisfied that at all times that each body which tendered was <i>ad idem <\/i>with its intention, namely, to put in place the most cost-effective building and facilities in line with the project's specification and regulations?<br\/><br\/>I am sorry to link all the questions together but it cannot be helped. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019011600002#NN00400","speaker":"1322","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1547629200,"counter":276,"content":"<p>There are probably seven or eight questions.

At that stage our board requested that the executive go back and look at alternative options for the project, conscious that we did not have to award the phase B works to BAM Ireland.  We had the option to tell BAM Ireland to complete the phase A works and go back out to the market so it did not have any entitlement to get the next phase of the project.  It was important for us to conclude the process to say definitively what the overall cost of the project was and in parallel with that, to look at what our other options were.<\/p> <p>  We looked at two other options, one of which was that we now had a totally completed design with all 6,000 rooms fully designed and detailed.  We had a fully detailed specification, bills of quantities and everything had now been itemised out so we could have gone back out to the market with that and re-tendered the project.  The issue with that was that it would cost a further &euro;300 million, additional to the &euro;1.4 billion we are reporting today and it would also delay the project by up to two years.  We looked at a traditional model of procurement in going back out to the market and we looked at a construction management model of going back out to the market which might have saved us some time but this had not been done under the public construction contracts and an increased risk would fall back to the client.  Having done that evaluation, it was clear that far and away the best option remained to award phase B to BAM Ireland, notwithstanding the cost challenge it poses.<\/p> <p>  The HSE carried out its review of that process as well as our internal review.  We met with the HSE and we presented to them over two days challenging whether that logic still held up but the clear recommendation was that it would delay the project further and it would cost more so the best option in procurement was to award phase B at that stage.  That was the decision our board made in November 2018 which was subsequently approved by Government in December.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019011600002#PP00100","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Pollock"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1547629200,"counter":278,"content":"<p>The Deputy asked about the difference between the lowest and the highest and that came to &euro;180 million.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019011600002#PP00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tom Costello"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1547629200,"counter":279,"content":"<p>To attract contractors to tender for this price we were conscious of the need to get Irish contractors and international contractors because there were a limited number of contractors in Ireland that could take on a job of this scale and we wanted to make sure that we maximised competition in the marketplace so we went to the UK to meet with contractors and present meet the buyer events there, encouraging them to tender for this project.  We shortlisted five companies to tender for it but notwithstanding that, in the end we only received four tenders.  The perception was that contractors would be falling over themselves for a project of this size but we only received four tenders.  However, it was important for us that we had managed to get international contractors.  Three international contractors made our shortlist, which sent out a message to the marketplace that this was a competitive process and that there would be high quality companies from abroad, which obviously delivered a competitive price at the end of the day.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019011600002#PP00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Pollock"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1547629200,"counter":280,"content":"<p>On the question of a fair price or the contractors abusing their position, which they could not have done in any case as they did not have an entitlement to the contract afterwards as Mr. Pollock has said, the procedures were clearly set down on how to get from stage one to stage two.  As I mentioned, the contractors and the design team worked together to develop the design to completion and to remove the risk because risk ultimately comes back to the client.<\/p><p>We are pleased to see that the HSE has commissioned a review of the stage two process and the determination of the final cost.  That is due to start next week and will be carried out over an eight-week period.  That is another level of due diligence that will happen on top of the due diligence we have done ourselves.<\/p><p> In evaluating the tenders our quantity surveyors go through the bill of quantities line by line for every item.  They carry out an analysis, in this case across the four bidders, to see if there are any outliers in costs, percentage add-ons or whatever.  That is why the process took a long time, from October 2016 when the bids went in to the final award in February 2017.  Before the contractors know where they are placed, there is an opportunity to seek clarifications.  A very detailed questionnaire goes back from the quantity surveyor to each of the four bidders seeking a document clarifying perceptions.  For instance, if an item did not have a price, it will clarify whether the price is deemed to be zero.  There is a due diligence process that goes on around that.<\/p><p> There was a very robust process to make sure that at the end of the day they were in line.  In the case of the lowest bidder, because it was very competitive, its tender naturally got a lot of scrutiny to make sure there were no gaps in it.

It was reported across the water that Carillion was building the Midland Metropolitan Hospital in the UK and because the firm went bust, the project will overrun by an estimated &euro;300 million and be delayed by a further three years.  People do not fully understand that consumer price inflation is very different from construction tender inflation.  The Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland publishes on its website construction tender inflation figures on a half-yearly and yearly basis.<\/p> <p>  People say costs do not come down but they do at times.  In 2007, when the construction industry was running full steam ahead, the fall in tenders to 2010 was measured at 50%.  If a party bought a project in 2007 at &euro;100 million, in 2010 contractors would price it at &euro;50 million.  That is a major drop and people at that stage were trying to buy business and protect their organisations.  They were trying to use their balance sheet to trade.  They were looking to avoid adversarial claims in their approach to projects.  From approximately 2013 onwards, construction inflation started to rise at 3% and it has been trending now nationally at approximately 7%.  In Dublin it trends higher than that.

As I stated to Deputy O'Reilly earlier, the analysis that was done prior to making the recommendation to go ahead factored in all of this.  One could make the assumption described by the Chairman but there is an opt-out clause.  Contractors do not always behave well and if the contractor took a really aggressive approach towards us, we could find while working with the design team that there was no collaboration.  Our contract is based on that.  The right answer in such a scenario is not to go ahead with another phase.  Sometimes this depends on money and we are talking about that today because it is very important.  In order to achieve project certainty, having had it tough to get to this stage of cost and programme certainty, it is important that everybody on the team, including contractors, the client and those relaying the requirements of the Children's Hospital Group, accept that it is fully defined.  Everybody must work together to honour this.  There is a contractual risk and associated responsibility in any case.

The risk has been wholly costed in this and it is being borne by the taxpayer.  If this came in at the average price of a hospital, I would say it was fair enough.  A hospital is to be built and we would have agreed a price that is approximately how much it costs to build hospitals, so the risk would be with the contractor.  The reality is this will be the most expensive hospital built anywhere in the world.  Anybody in the country looking to build a house or extension, or who gets in a builder to do any work, can have a fixed-price contract that will put the risk on the contractor.<\/p><p>If they have been quoted by the contractor the highest price ever quoted anywhere in the world to do the work, clearly they are being hoodwinked and taken for fools if they think any of the risk, in a real sense, is with the contractor.  I just find it extraordinary that the board maintains we are going to have the most expensive hospital ever built anywhere on earth but that we are very clever because the risk of the construction costs is with the contractor.<\/p><p> Will the board release the various reports to the committee?  I would be very surprised if several of the figures we are discussing were like for like comparisons.  For example, the board's initial estimate was based on AECOM stating in 2014 that the cost would be &euro;2,500 per sq. m.  The size of the project is 160,000 sq. m, which gives a total construction cost of &euro;400 million.  I was a member of the finance committee when the national lottery was sold for &euro;400 million.  The conversation we had was that the &euro;400 million would pay for the national children's hospital because that was the estimated cost.  That is where is all started - at a figure of &euro;400 million.  If AECOM stated in 2014 that the cost would be &euro;2,500 per sq. m for a building 160,000 sq. m in size, that gave a figure of &euro;400 million.  The board's representatives have said inflation was factored in and it was.  If one factors in inflation at a rate of 3%, the figure moves from &euro;400 million to &euro;460 million.  AECOM's estimated price would have given us a total building cost of &euro;460 million in 2018, yet the board states AECOM gave it another report in 2018 that stated the cost was not, in fact, &euro;2,800 per sq. m but &euro;6,000.  Somehow, within a short period of four years, the estimated cost per square metre had jumped from &euro;2,800 to &euro;6,000.  I do not believe that and fundamentally do not accept that they are like for like comparisons.  The material, labour and professional services used on a project of this size are not all being sourced in Ireland.  They are international commodities.  There is no way the cost of bricks and mortar and the amount of money paid to sparkies, chippies and engineers doubled in a four year period.  I just do not accept that it did.<\/p><p> There is a second report from Linesight that conveniently states there has been 95% tender price inflation, which fits in quite neatly with the massive overruns we are discussing.  Two international benchmarking studies are also referenced, one of which I presume is the Linesight report.  Can the board release to the committee AECOM's work in 2014 that started with a figure of &euro;2,500 per sq. m, giving a total estimated cost of &euro;400 million, the 2018 figures - somehow the figure moved from &euro;2,500 per sq. m to &euro;6,000 - and the Linesight report that states there was 95% tender price inflation?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019011600002#TT01100","speaker":"1436","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1547629200,"counter":334,"content":"<p>We can.

Were the witnesses at those meetings making sure that the Minister was kept in the loop, kept informed, and that the concerns of the witnesses were shared with the most senior person within the health arena?  I think we all understand the structure, so there is no need to describe that.  Were the witnesses satisfied that their concerns about the cost overruns had been fully made known to the Minister and he was fully across it back in August?  As there were meetings on a weekly basis, I am sure that would have caused some concern.<\/p> <p>  A number of the questions I was going to ask have been covered already, so I will stick to the ones that have not been asked.  Who owns the land that the proposed children's research and innovation centre is being built on?  Who will own the building and how will the construction be paid for?  Is it to be paid for through some sort of philanthropic fund?  How is it envisaged that will be paid for?<\/p><p> My next question relates to the naming of the hospital and the concern regarding a memo brought to Cabinet which alluded to the naming rights being sold.  The Minister moved quickly to say that he would not sell the naming rights for the hospital but he did not say he would not sell the naming rights for individual areas within the hospital.  Does this feature in the board's plans?  Notwithstanding the opposition of other parties in the D&aacute;il, Sinn F&eacute;in believes there is good reason the hospital should be called the Kathleen Lynn hospital.  As in the case of many of our universities, is it intended to sell the naming rights for a particular area of research and so on and, if so, have any discussions in this regard taken place to date and do the witnesses have ballpark figures with regard to investment which they may be able to share with us?<\/p><p> With regard to the Crumlin children's hospital site, what are the plans for it?  Will it be available to the board?  I would like to return to an issue I raised earlier with regard to the additionality of beds.  Will beds in hospitals other than the three children's hospitals, for example, Limerick hospital, be closed on the basis of bed capacity at the new hospital?  Obviously, this would have an impact on the sum total of beds available for children.  Mr. Costello said in his opening statement that there are lessons to be learned in regard to the wisdom of pursuing cost reductions on competitive tenders and ensuring the sufficiency of tender information.  Will he identify those lessons, perhaps, in detailed follow-up correspondence?  Mr. Costello used the word \"disappointment\" in his opening statement.  I would use a much stronger word than that.  The lessons being learned are extremely expensive.  Has Mr. Costello communicated the lessons learned to the Department of Health and, if so, is he in a position to share that correspondence with us?  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019011600002#XX02400","speaker":"1302","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1547629200,"counter":413,"content":"<p>I will ask Ms Hardiman to respond to the Deputy's questions regarding the children's research and innovation centre, CRIC, the naming of the children's hospital and the additionality of beds.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019011600002#YY00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tom Costello"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1547629200,"counter":414,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for her questions.  It is important to speak to the broader health system.  From the get-go, the planning for this hospital has been a whole of Ireland approach.  There is a national model of care for paediatrics that underpins the policy position as to why we need to consolidate the high-end tertiary, quaternary requirements into one hospital and for it to be based in Dublin.  Through the HSE, we have been working with our colleagues across the system to ensure that we are planning in a collaborative way around children's health.  We have an integrated care programme for children, such that we engage not only with our colleagues in Cork, Limerick and Galway in the acute system but with colleagues in social care, community and mental health, which is important in terms of the experiences of First World countries with young people and mental health issues.  We have identified that there are services that could and should be done locally in the regional units.  The model of care maps the services that can be done in regional units and the services that can be done in local units and the required resourcing of them.  We have appointed a paediatric network lead, a surgeon, to work with the regional units on the appropriate utilisation of their beds.  This is about transforming children's health care.<\/p> <p>  The biggest transformation is around ambulatory services.  What we are putting out at Connolly Hospital and Tallaght Hospital is testing within the Irish system the feasibility of safely delivering outpatient, trauma, orthopaedic and urgent care in an efficient manner.<\/p><p>We would envision that in testing it in these units, it is something that the wider system could look at in terms of bed utilisation.  There is repatriation needed from the Dublin hospitals to the regional units, but only in a supported way.  We work closely with the clinician we have put in place in regard to the putting in place of education and supports in the regional units.  Increasingly, we are holding shared clinics in the regional units.  We are trying to keep services child and family centric so that service users can access services locally and only need to come to Dublin as required.  There is no additionality.  Cork has plans for a hospital.  In regard to the plans for the elective hospitals, we have been working with our colleagues in the regional units identifying the parameters that we use for the model of care to try to ensure the most efficient use of bed planning.  Cork is the only region that has identified additional plans.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019011600002#YY00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Eil&iacute;sh Hardiman","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1547629200,"counter":416,"content":"<p>My question was if there are plans to close beds that are currently being utilised for paediatrics.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019011600002#ZZ00200","speaker":"1302"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1547629200,"counter":417,"content":"<p>No.  We are testing the model of care with the ambulatory and other care centres that could possibly bring benefits around that, but that would need to be tested and demonstrated and then taken into consideration as part of the transformation programme.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy asked about the Crumlin children's hospital site.  It is important to record our appreciation of the committee's help in getting the legislation to merge the three children's hospitals through in 2018.  As of 1 January, Children's Health Ireland governs the provision of paediatric services in the Dublin hospitals at Crumlin, Temple Street and Tallaght and will open services in Connolly hospital in the middle of this year.  Under the legislation, the voluntary boards of Crumlin and Temple Street hospitals had to voluntarily transfer their assets and liabilities to the new entity.  The Crumlin hospital campus was owned by the board and it has transferred to Children's Health Ireland.  We can only use our assets to deliver services to children.  The future use of the campus has not been explored.  We will use it to deliver children's services until such time as the new children's hospital has opened and, as such, it will be occupied for the next four years.  We will have to engage in a planning process in regard to the future use of the site.  Following on from the merger, we see it as a planning option that we will put into place over the next few years.  We certainly have use of the site for the next four years.  Its future use has to benefit the children's hospitals.  That is the condition under which it was transferred and it is the only purpose for which we can use it.<\/p> <p>  On the naming of the hospital, I am happy to clarify that there is no proposal to sell the name of the children's hospital, which the Minister has confirmed.  We have already reported that there is a process to be engaged in for naming the hospital.  It will acknowledge the work that has been done to date and take into consideration nominations and submissions made.  We intend to kick off the process of naming the hospital soon.<\/p> <p>  On the Deputy's question as to whether there will be an opportunity to have philanthropic fundraising for parts of the hospital recognised, that is up for consideration.  Many of the children's hospitals already do this.  On the children's research and innovation centre, planning permission has been secured.  The lands on which the centre will be built are owned by the HSE and so whatever is constructed on the land will be owned by the HSE.  As in the case of Crumlin children's hospital, funding for the children's research and innovative centre will come from philanthropic fundraising.  We see this as an ideal opportunity for naming one part of the building.<\/p><p>There are commercial elements that are feasible that we are exploring.  Those are only in the discussion stages and will work through the HSE and the Department.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019011600002#ZZ00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Eil&iacute;sh Hardiman","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1547629200,"counter":419,"content":"<p>On that point, I saw a posting on social media from somebody who was outraged at the suggestion that the naming rights for any part of the national children's hospital would be sold off.  The individual wondered, no doubt tongue in cheek, whether we could see the name of a brand of cigarettes being borne by the national children's cancer research centre.  The fact is that once that process is started, there is less and less control over it.  I could point to examples in the third level sector where this practice does not only represent poor value for money but also assists individuals in purchasing a certain amount of credibility that they possibly should not have.  I am referring to very wealthy individuals who, in a very tax efficient manner, channel money into certain causes.<\/p> <p>  That would concern me.

As part of the exercise we have done, and ultimately the report to the HSE, we have learned lessons.  As always, there were positives as well as negatives, and we identified two in my statement.  I will go through them a little.  On cost reductions, because we are in an inflationary cycle, the tenders received were higher than the pre-tender estimates.  In those cases, people invariably look for cost reductions.  Again, in hindsight, we are referring to looking for a cost reduction at a time when prices were still inflating at 6% or 7%.  A cost reduction might also be an alternative material.  While in that inflationary cycle, however, there is no guarantee that the cost reduction will come to anything and eventually one may end up back where one started.  That was a lesson learned in the cycle.  Those things cannot necessarily be predicted.  They were all done with good intentions and the contractors bought into it, but when we interrogated deliverability over the months, we found it was not possible.<\/p> <p>  The other question was on reporting.  We were meeting regularly.

Like many members of the committee I feel that Irish children have been neglected for a long time at Our Lady's Children's Hospital, Crumlin.  I have reason to be there a bit myself, and I often send the Minister for Health photographs of the walls to remind him what it is like.  I look forward to this project reaching completion in 2022.<\/p> <p>  I am not a big fan of fellows learning on the job when they are getting paid to do a job.  It is quite shocking that Mr. Costello would say that a process has worked well when we are at the price we are at currently.  It is rule 101 that the difference between the tendering price and the contract price must be watched.  Who was watching this?  Was a team of quantity surveyors employed in the initial tendering phase?  Regarding the differential between the tender price and the contract price, I am assuming that a team of quantity surveyors was involved, and I am assuming that all of the work it did was therefore pointless if there was such a difference between point 1 and point 2.  Perhaps Mr. Costello can elaborate on that. <\/p> <p>  Deputy Louise O'Reilly was talking about this as I was coming in.  I missed the start of what she was saying.  Can the witnesses clarify that other than the three bits the witnesses identified as being operated by other people, the land will all be kept under HSE ownership?  Can they also clarify that no external private company will be contracted to provide services in the hospital?  For example, can we be assured that the cath lab, the minor injuries unit, if there is one, or whatever facilities there are will not be run by a private entity?  Can we be assured that we are not going to carve bits out and allow them to be operated by a private medical company despite being owned by the HSE?  It is something we will probably discuss in this term at the Joint Committee on Health.  I have seen an emerging trend of private companies operating in sites with HSE logos over the door.  It is something that concerns me.  Perhaps the witnesses could clarify that for me.  <\/p> <p>  Mr. Pollock referred to the change in clinical standards.  I assume he is saying that if some piece of equipment or infrastructure that will be of benefit to the hospital comes on board between now and 2022, the hospital will want to move with the times.  Technically, there could be another bill if a new type of magical cable comes out and the board will just have to pay it.  I am assuming as much.

That is my point.  At the start of this meeting, the witnesses spoke about cables.  They had a price for cables.  It seems insane that they had 5.5 km of cable but in their first phase of pricing, they did not know how many strips of cable would be needed and whether it would be 5 x 5 km.  How could they start off a tendering process without knowing how much wire they needed or without having a sum built in for that so that they could say it could go between X and X x 10?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019011600002#GGG00800","speaker":"1297"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1547629200,"counter":555,"content":"<p>I will explain the process again.  First, we did deep analysis in terms of ultimately deciding that the two-stage process was appropriate for this project.  One thing that is certain and that has been learned in Ireland, the UK and internationally is that the model of traditional tendering where the client designs it without any involvement with contractors has been proven to fail repeatedly because the contractors invariably bid at or below cost and try to exploit the opportunities if there is a looseness in the contract documentation.  It is a very competitive marketplace.  With the two-stage tender, one works on the basis of a preliminary design, the contractor then works with the design team to develop that to completeness and the contractor takes the risk from that day forward.

We have put together a submission that the committee may have seen and it conveys the points we wish to make; I will speak to that rather than read it for the committee in order to highlight a few points.  Mr. Dignam will deal with any queries on what we suggest might be imperfections in the Bill as it currently stands but I will speak more to the main point in the submission, which is the suggestion that perhaps the model selected in the draft Bill is not the best way to go about addressing what is an important matter.<\/p> <p>  I should start by saying that it is to be welcomed that there is a legislative response to the important issue of Ireland being in default with respect to its international obligations under the European Convention on Human Rights.  It has been made clear in court and Ireland has accepted it in a number of cases.  Perhaps it is boring to say it but it must be said that the root cause of court delays is the fact that our courts are not properly resourced.  There are not enough appointed judges, registrars or support for the judges.  If this persists, it is likely the problems associated with court delays will also persist.  Nonetheless, it is proper to address the concerns raised in the Bill.<\/p> <p>  The Bill chooses a non courts-based model of providing compensation to those affected by court delays.  The Bill envisages there would be an administrative tribunal or body set up that would be staffed by a retired judge or judges, who would then adjudicate on the question of whether compensation should be awarded, and if so, in what amount.<\/p><p>The point we have offered is that while it might appear superficially attractive to take the function out of the courts, take it away from lawyers and, as it were, make it simplified and cheaper, and while those are legitimate and proper concerns, we believe that it may not be in the public interest, as we have laid out in our submission.  It may not be the best way of approaching this issue and delivering on the objectives the Bill is directed to meet.<\/p><p> One of the reasons is expense.  It is difficult to identify a good, valid reason as to why the Exchequer should be hit with the undoubted significant cost associated with setting up a whole new administrative structure, staffing it, paying salaries, paying for clerical staff, paying for an office through rent or purchase, and resourcing it.  For this reason we suggest that this is perhaps not the ideal way to proceed.<\/p><p> There is a pre-built, existing structure that is very efficient when it is working well, which is the courts.  We make the point in our paper that the Oireachtas, in earlier legislative provisions, decided that the best way to deal with meeting our objectives under the European Convention on Human Rights and providing justice for our citizens across a range of legal areas is to do it on the courts-based model.  For instance, section 3 of the existing European Convention on Human Rights Act allows a citizen who has been wrongly deprived of his or her liberty to go to the Circuit Court to make a case to be awarded compensation if he or she has been locked up unlawfully and suffered the indignity of being put into prison without just cause.  That was a legislative decision made by the Oireachtas, and the Bar Council of Ireland feels that it is difficult to identify a good reason the same model should not be followed here.  It is not known quite how many cases there might be of plaintiffs seeking relief for court delays.  There are likely to be more than those who would seek damages for being unlawfully imprisoned, but there may not be too many.<\/p><p> This is the other point.  Whatever about the issue of principle, it is difficult to see why it would be justified economically.  The pure, raw numbers make it difficult to see how it could be justified to set up an entirely new administrative structure for what may not be ultimately a large number of cases.  That issue, however, is a little bit unknown.<\/p><p> At the level of principle and given the potential legal complexity that is associated with claims for compensation for breaches of Article 13 and the right to speedy access to justice, and given that the European Convention on Human Rights has identified that these claims can be really quite complex, although not always, this is an issue that is best left to the courts that are well used to receiving submissions, weighing up competing interests and judging how best to give justice when there has been a breach of rights.  These are routine matters for a Circuit Court, High Court or District Court judge or whoever it might be to add to his or her bundle of cases.  There would not have to be the extra amount of training and costs associated with setting up an entirely new separate structure.  The Bar Council of Ireland believes that this can be properly dealt with under the existing courts structure.  That would be most fair to the citizen and best suited to the public interest with regard to these various headings.<\/p><p> There is also a risk, if one proceeds down the road of setting up a separate administrative body, that the body itself could be at risk of being judicially reviewed or having complaints made against it on grounds of delay.  It also could be challenged for making what might be thought of as unreasonable decisions if it decides to refuse an application for compensation or if it awards what the citizen feels is too little.  We believe that this is a further stand-alone ground for leaving these cases to the parties that are best equipped to deal with the issues, namely, trained judges who are independent and well used to dealing with legal cases and the complexity of legal issues.<\/p><p> We have made a number of recommendations in our paper, which members may have seen.  We suggest that these matters be left to the courts and perhaps a similar model chosen along the lines of section 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights Act.<\/p><p>The idea is simply to create the statutory remedy of going to court and allowing that to be done.  As to which court, it would be a matter entirely for the Legislature of course.  We do not believe there is any particular reason to depart from the pre-existing model of doing it in the Circuit Court or perhaps doing it in the High Court.  That is entirely a matter for the Legislature.  We acknowledge there may be different reasons for choosing whichever comment committee members might make.<\/p><p> It is undoubtedly an issue that has a degree of urgency in that Ireland is in default.  That is not inconsequential and needs to be immediately addressed.  We believe that delayed claims need to be considered and dealt with properly under the existing and well-provided established structure.  The ideal environment for the fair and just determination of these Article 6 breach claims is the court's model.  By taking that approach we believe there would be consistency in the law.  It is already being done in that way and we do not find the case persuasive &ndash; although it is a matter entirely for the Houses &ndash; for lifting it and creating an entirely new structure.  We do not find that would really be the way to proceed from a practical point of view, from a justice point of view or from a principle point of view.  I would be happy to take any questions on the issues arising.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019011600002#O00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Miche&aacute;l P.

We are a voluntary independent legal rights organisation that exists to promote access to justice.  We believe access to justice includes not only legal aid but access to the courts, to effective remedies and to fair, just and socially inclusive laws.  We welcome the opportunity to contribute to this pre-legislative scrutiny and we welcome that the matter will be put on a legislative basis.<\/p> <p>  We also view delay as the major inhibitor of access to justice.  From our work we see that delay arises in several arenas, including waiting times for legal aid.  The most recent figures from the Legal Aid Board show a waiting time of up to 42 weeks for a first appointment in the Blanchardstown Legal Aid Board law centre and more than six months in several other centres.  The processing time for social welfare appeals is a problem.  The most recent social welfare appeals report showed that the average time to process social welfare appeals was 23.6 weeks and 30.3 weeks in the case of supplementary welfare allowance, which is supposed to provide a basic safety net payment.  The most recent report of the social welfare appeals office states that 63.6% of oral appeals were successful.  The Court of Appeal was set up to reduce delay but individuals now must wait for up to two years before getting an appeal heard there.<\/p> <p>  We are keen for the committee to look at the issue of delay not only in respect of the contents of the Bill but as a systemic issue.  There is a commitment in the programme for Government to commission an annual study on court efficiency and sitting times to provide accurate measures for improving access to justice.  We urge that this commitment would be fulfilled.  There is a real need to have accurate measures to measure improvements in access to justice.<\/p> <p>  A review of the administration of civil justice is ongoing.  It is being carried out by the High Court President, Mr. Justice Peter Kelly.  One of the aims of the review is to improve access to justice.  Clearly, the issue of delay will be looked at by this review group.  We submit that the outcome of this review should be of fundamental interest to the committee.  We ask that the committee would make access to justice a central ongoing feature of its work.<\/p> <p>  I will comment on the heads of the Bill.   We have seven basic points to make and I will go through them quickly.  Delays that occur before quasi-judicial bodies and tribunals should be included in the legislation.  This is important from the perspective of calculating when proceedings commence and should be taken into account in determining any compensatory remedy for unreasonable delays that arise in proceedings before such bodies.<\/p> <p>  Whether a delay in a particular case arises directly or indirectly through delays in a related case should not make any difference to the entitlement to apply for compensation and to be awarded it, if merited.<\/p><p> Our third comment on the heads of the Bill is that the direct linking of any financial compensation payable under the proposed legislation to the principles and practices of the European Court of Human Rights is problematic and undesirable.  We suggest that the removal of specific references to the ECHR and Article 41 under head 8 would provide a more fluid and flexible remedy for court-based delays.  In turn, we could more readily provide a remedy for any breach of EU law that might arise in that regard than the present formulation would allow.<\/p><p> The fourth point in respect of the heads of the Bill is that, as proposed, the assessor would be a retired judge.  It is unclear to us why there is a need for a requirement for the High Court to approve awards of compensation given that it is also the forum for the determination of appeals under the proposed legislation.<\/p><p> Our fifth point relates to multiple claims.  The proposed Bill is silent in respect of further delays that might accrue after an award has been made and if the proceedings are not determined by that time.  We believe that the legislation should provide clarity in that regard.<\/p><p> The sixth point relates to where a case is ongoing in any application for case management before the courts.  We believe that judicial notice could be taken of any determination under the proposed Act by an assessor that unreasonable delay has occurred and the reasons for same.<\/p><p> The final point relates to costs.  There is no provision under the heads of the Bill for the expenses of making a successful application to be discharged by the State or Minister.  Inevitably, this means that such costs will be taken from the award.  This could possibly undermine the effectiveness of such a remedy.  We are suggesting that this issue could be remedied by providing for a flat fee to a practitioner who assists the client to make a successful application.  Such a measure should, in turn, require the practitioner to undertake not to seek further payment for an award.<\/p><p> These are our summary comments on the Bill.  Ms Lucey will be happy to answer any detailed questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019011600002#Q00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Eilis Barry","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1547645400,"counter":589,"content":"<p>I will now open the discussion up to members.

Often, these matters would be cost neutral.  For instance, the courts system earns money from court pleadings and filing charges.

In addition, the State earns a sizeable income stream from taxation on the professional fees of lawyers operating in the system as well as value added tax on those fees.  This is a point that we sought to make in our proposal to the Government, which thankfully the Government has accepted and decided to support.

Generally, people only do that once or twice in their lives.  Some people are lucky and never have to do it.  It is an extremely stressful process.  The good aspect of having the Bar Council and FLAC in attendance is that they are aware of the stress that the invocation of one's rights and having to seek justice can place on individuals.  Sometimes, people on the outside do not appreciate that.  Delay can have an aggravating impact on that stress.  Recently, a woman who was a complainant disclosed her identity in a rape trial.  One of the things she said after the accused had been convicted was that she had found the delay of four years, from her making her complaint to the years spent in the court process, extremely stressful.  There is a purpose behind the provisions within the European Convention on Human Rights, ECHR, on why there should be a speedy and effective remedy when delay has been introduced into the system.<\/p> <p>  My first question is for the Bar Council.  I may be wrong but, when we contemplate delays, there are two types in the court system, the first of which is the delay caused by a case not getting on for a period of time.  For example, it might not be listed on the first occasion or the next occasion.  The second type is the delay caused by a judge who, after hearing the case, does not give judgment promptly.  Are those the two types of delay we are considering?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019011600002#T00400","speaker":"1296"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1547645400,"counter":607,"content":"<p>Yes, but I will address the Deputy's comments on the stress of court proceedings first.  In many respects, that is what is being directed by the jurisprudence of the ECHR.  An anomaly arising from the heads of the Bill is that a victim or complainant in, for example, a criminal trial who has suffered stress and damage as a result of delays in our system does not appear to be one of the categories of person who can seek compensation.<\/p><p>In relation to the delays, the two types of delay the Deputy identified are the ones which we have also identified.  These are, as the Deputy stated, the delay in a case getting on because of the shortage of judges or resources in the courts system to enable cases to get on when they should, and also the post hearing delay of a judge not giving judgment expeditiously.  Of course, the latter delay is not the fault of the judge.  That judge finishes one case on a given day, takes up another case the next morning and when he is finished that case, takes up yet another case.  The demands on judicial resources are such that it is difficult for judges to provide judgments in cases that they may have heard two, three or four cases ago within a reasonable and quick period of time such as to avoid any complaint or delay.  Those are the two principal types of delay.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019011600002#T00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Conor Dignam","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1547645400,"counter":609,"content":"<p>In terms of the latter delay where it is after a hearing has concluded, a judge in that case will have other factors or issues that he or she must deal with.

The Bar Council, as the representative body for barristers, is constantly engaged with the notion of systemic reform.  Yesterday, if not last week, we finalised a submission to a review that is under way at the moment on the civil justice side of the system, not the criminal side but the superior courts civil justice system.  Mr. Justice Peter Kelly, the President of the High Court, is conducting that review across a range of areas, for instance, judicial review, which is associated with supervising the powers and activities of lower tribunals and lower courts in the High Court.  It also includes the whole area of discovery, which is a big issue in litigation, including the costs associated with discovery, the delays that discovery brings and undesirable aspects of discovery.<\/p> <p>  We very much engaged with the process that is under way.  Various interested parties have put forward their views, not just lawyer groups but officials in the Courts Service and those involved in the system, with a view to trying to achieve efficiencies and improve access to justice, which is really what this should be all about, and also creating a situation where members of the public are informed about their rights so that they are encouraged to go to court and participate in what is a very important forum for the vindication of their rights.  These initiatives take many forms.  One simple path that we are following at the moment is an endeavour to try to make the law less mysterious and use plain ordinary English in legislation, regulations and submissions that barristers make.  There is an encouragement being given to people - I know this seems odd - to actually speak in the English language, rather than in obscure old fashioned legalese which, unfortunately, has been a feature of the system, certainly in the past and perhaps not only in the past.  The aim is to make the system more accessible and relevant to litigants and members of the public so that they will know their rights and have an opportunity to access the courts to vindicate those rights.  That is another project that is very much under way.  Much has been done under that heading but more remains to be done.<\/p> <p>  I agree with the Deputy that this is not a simple case of calling for more money or resources to be thrown at the courts.  Just as I am sure those advocating for reforms on the health side would say the solution is not all about appointing more doctors, nurses, hospital porters or whomever.  It is about channelling those resources, improving efficiencies and reforming the system so that a better product is delivered and a better service is provided to members of the public.  We are very much aware of that and that is why we have not just called for an increase in resources but, in fact, a correct channelling of those resources.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019011600002#X00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Miche&aacute;l P.

We are not suggesting it should be the High Court.  The reason we identified the Circuit Court as the appropriate court is that the Oireachtas has already identified the Circuit Court as being the appropriate court to deal with claims under section 3A of the Act.  From a consistency point of view, we do not see any good reason to depart from the model that was put in place by the Oireachtas as recently as 2014 when the amendment was introduced.<\/p> <p>  On the substance of the point, which is whether a court based system would be a disincentive to individuals, the first point to note is that there is an appeals process in place.  If the assessor model, as currently framed, is established, an individual can bring a claim to the assessor.  If he or she is successful in that claim, the award is then appealable by the State and the appeal goes directly from the assessor to the High Court.  This means the individual is then dragged into the High Court despite not wanting to be there.  Avoiding a court based model at first instance does not avoid an individual ending up before the courts.  For this reason, it seems to us there is no good reason the individual should not be permitted to go to court with his or her claim.<\/p> <p>  The second point is that individuals want their claims to be determined in a fair and transparent manner.  As I mentioned, the European Court of Human Rights, ECHR, has clearly stated that the question of a delay and compensation for delay is one of complexity.  An individual does not want his or her complex issue to be determined by an assessor on the basis of paperwork and written reports.  Some cases will be straightforward but others will not.  The claimant will want to have his or her say in regard to whether compensation should be awarded.<\/p> <p>  Equally, the assessor model deprives the State of the right to participate at that first stage.  The claim is submitted and the State has no right to participate or make submissions on whether compensation should be awarded.  If compensation is awarded, there is then an automatic appeal on the part of the State, not to the Circuit Court or District Court, but to the High Court.  There does not seem to us to be the disincentive which Deputy Chambers mentions attached to a court based system as opposed to an assessor system.  It would seem to us that the assessor system provides for greater curtailment on an individual's rights and entitlements to have his or her case disposed of fairly and transparently.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019011600002#Y00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Conor Dignam"},{"type":"speech","time":1547645400,"counter":654,"content":"<p>Does FLAC have an opinion on the matter?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019011600002#Z00100","speaker":"1255"},{"type":"speech","time":1547645400,"counter":655,"content":"<p>I invite Ms Barry or Ms Lucey to respond.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019011600002#Z00200","speaker":"1269"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1547645400,"counter":656,"content":"<p>We are not tied to any particular model but we are concerned that whatever model is adopted would be accessible, speedy and at a low cost.

This feeds into the efficiencies.  There has been an exponential rise in lay litigants going before the court, leading to judges having to spend a huge amount of time guiding the lay litigant through the system and procedures so they can at least get their cases heard.  While judges are very good at doing this, they do not really have the time to do it.

The emphasis has been on an examination of the subject matter of the proceeding and the level of complexity involved in the proceedings.  The ultimate question that the assessor, the judge in the model we are suggesting, would be the relative causes for the delay and the justifications for it.  It is not simply a question of the ECHR case law making this clear or a question of looking at the raw level of the length of the delay.<\/p><p>Rather, it is a question of measuring the delay and assessing how culpable it is in the context of the nature of the proceedings at issue, what was at stake for the litigant and whether the justifications put forward on behalf of the responding party passed muster.  It involves measuring and weighing up justifications against one another with a view to arriving at an answer to whether the delay was unreasonable, has it been justified and is it just to award compensation by reason of the delay.<\/p><p> Something else that must be borne in mind regarding how the ECHR jurisprudence treats of this issue is an assessment of the impact the delay has had on the individual litigant.  Some litigants are stoic and can deal with a lot of delay, such as, perhaps, a young person who is not terribly bothered.  There are also people who are highly stressed, elderly or, perhaps, do not have long to live, or whatever the particular personal circumstances may be.  All of these feed into the measurement.  We do not suggest every case is hugely complex but many cases have these complexities.  The drafters of the Bill seem to acknowledge this because they have provided that it should be a judge or retired judge who is the assessor.  For this reason it appears to be common case that these issues are somewhat complex, or certainly have the potential for complexities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019011600002#Z00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Miche&aacute;l P.

There is a difficult to calculate advantage and positive element to litigants feeling they have had their day in court with barristers standing up for them and telling the judge there was a wrong done.

A section 3A claim for compensation for unlawful detention, which is directed into the Circuit Court by the ECHR Act, can only be made where there has already been a finding by a court that there was unlawful detention.  In such a case the substantive issue has already been decided and, in effect, what is being decided by the Circuit Court in this instance is the level of compensation.  Under the system being established in the Bill the first things that have to be decided is whether there was a delay, whether there was a culpable delay, in other words whether the State is guilty or responsible for that delay, and how much compensation should be paid.  Under the proposed system the first two elements, which are really the substantive findings that have to be made, are being passed to an assessor to determine on the basis of the papers.  To draw an analogy, it would be like having an assessor deciding based on papers whether a person has been unlawfully detained.  This would not allow the person to make full submissions or representations and would not allow the person alleged to have unlawfully detained the person to make submissions or representations on whether the detention was unlawful.  It seems anomalous to put a more complex issue, which is the compensation for delay, into an assessor system with the more straightforward issue of compensation for a detention that has already been found to be unlawful going to the Circuit Court.

It is the court where citizens of the country have the most interface and contact with the criminal justice system.

The first relates to FLAC's submission but the Bar Council of Ireland might wish to comment also.  FLAC identified an inconsistency in the approach.  It identified inconsistency regarding the European Court of Human Rights Act 2003.  I understand it is related to the fact that compensation in the Bill is based on ECHR principles and that it is a sort of compromise based on the arrangements across the various jurisdictions under the ECHR, some are very different economically, socially and legally.  Could the delegates comment on that?<\/p> <p>  Let me refer to another point FLAC made, which also applies equally to the alternative put forward by the Bar Council of Ireland.  I refer to a case where there is a delay in determining the quantum of compensation and where that compensation is determined by the High Court.  When such a case returns to the High Court under the process, there is a perception of a conflict of interest or of a lack of independence, even if there are different judges.<\/p> <p>  Could the representatives from FLAC address both of those points?  Could the representatives from the Bar Council of Ireland address them briefly also?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019011600002#CC00100","speaker":"1287"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1547645400,"counter":676,"content":"<p>Our point on head 8 was on the quantum effectively being linked to the approach of the European Court of Human Rights.  Our point is that the State is really required to put in place a remedy that is effective in the domestic sense rather than replicate a remedy that might be available to a litigant that takes the very long road to get to the European Court of Human Rights.<\/p> <p>  The difficulty we perceive is that the quantum before the European court is quite different from what would be awarded by the Irish courts in similar cases but that is because the European court is doing a completely different job when it decides a case against the State than an Irish court or quasi-judicial tribunal when it decides on a dispute before it.  Often the European court will say it has decided there has been a breach of rights, in the view that the simple act of deciding the case in one's favour and declaring there has been a breach is adequate compensation or, as it often calls it, \"just satisfaction\".  It will often not provide any remedy in damages at all.  On other occasions, where it does consider providing remedy in damages, it is often an amount that might well be a very effective remedy in Bulgaria but that would hardly pay for one's flight from Ireland to Strasbourg if one were to go there to have one's case heard.  The same applies to legal aid.  That can be awarded by the European court.<\/p> <p>  It is like apples and oranges.  While we should be providing for apples, we have ended up providing for oranges, and that seems to be the proposal.  Consider the position if we were to reconsider all those cases that went before the European Court of Human Rights and found Ireland in default.  If we actually had a properly functioning system of compensation for delays operating in a domestic sense, there never would have been a finding against Ireland.  Therefore, the absence of a domestic remedy was the issue but there is now no need to bring in a European remedy and to try to transplant it into the Irish context.  To us, there seems to be no real justification for making the direct linkage, and that direct linkage is not made in the European Court of Human Rights Act 2003, which is the main legislation providing remedies for breaches of the convention.<\/p> <p>  The other problem we have identified, which is probably speculative to some extent, concerns the question of an excessive delay in obtaining a remedy for a breach of one's rights under EU law.  If somebody takes a case before the courts, where is he or she supposed to go for a remedy?<\/p><p>If machinery is already being put in place by the State for delays, why should it not accommodate delays in whatever context they arise, be it EU law or a breach of Article 6 of the convention?  Again, it seems to be a misplaced notion that this is purely a remedy that should stand in the European Court of Justice rather than before the domestic courts.<\/p><p> The other issue raised is the loop that seems to have been included in the legislation whereby an award made goes to the High Court to be approved and then to the same court for an appeal to be heard on it.  While a High Court judge will no doubt act independently if considering an appeal, it could create a perception that the appeals process is not wholly independent if the same forum that approves the award hears the appeal.  That is just a basic point.  Maybe it needs to be considered.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019011600002#CC00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Sin&eacute;ad Lucey","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1547645400,"counter":678,"content":"<p>Would the representatives from the Bar Council of Ireland like to add to that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019011600002#DD00200","speaker":"1269"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1547645400,"counter":679,"content":"<p>Everything has been said eloquently.

If that is intended to mean that one must produce a medical report to show a psychiatric injury or such like, for instance, it would be setting the bar too high and would cut away from a right to compensation people who have suffered stress, a loss of enjoyment of their life, or who have had an unnecessary disappointment visited upon them.

Where, for the sake of argument, the assessor would decide without the State being involved in the assessment, it would then go to the High Court without the State being involved and the High Court would approve the award.  The State would have a right of appeal against that award and the appeal would go to the High Court.  FLAC's concern is that the same court would be deciding on the award and the assessment.  We do not regard that, on the level of principle, as being a difficulty because High Court judges, day in, day out, have to exercise independent judgment and engage in independent decision-making.  Therefore, we do not see a difficulty with a High Court judge hearing an appeal where a different High Court judge has already approved the award.  This is because they would be hearing different arguments and would have the benefit of the argument made by the State.  What we do believe it underlines is that the drafters of the heads of Bill have identified that the question of compensation for a delay in proceedings is a very significant issue, so significant that it warrants the High Court being involved in deciding that the award is an appropriate award.  To us, that underlines that the matter is so significant it should actually be determined by the courts in the first instance rather than an assessor.  Other than somebody in drafting the heads of the Bill having identified it as a significant issue, we do not see any other reason the High Court could be involved.  If the High Court is to be involved in approving the award in the first place, why not simply have the courts determine the substantive issue and the quantum of damages?

It would be remiss of us if we did not reflect this in the definition as one of the guiding principles to which the competent authority must pay attention.<\/p><p>The WHO&rsquo;s 2018 environmental noise guidelines for the European region stated:<\/p><blockquote>For average noise exposure, the [guideline development group, GDG,] strongly recommends reducing noise levels produced by aircraft below 45 dB, as aircraft noise above this level is associated with adverse health effects.<br \/><br \/>For night noise exposure, the GDG strongly recommends reducing noise levels produced by aircraft during night time below 40 dB, as night-time aircraft noise above this level is associated with adverse effects on sleep.<br \/><br \/>To reduce health effects, the GDG strongly recommends that policy-makers implement suitable measures to reduce noise exposure from aircraft in the population exposed to levels above the guideline values for average and night noise exposure.<br \/><br \/>For specific interventions the GDG recommends implementing suitable changes in infrastructure.<\/blockquote><p>If we do not reflect the health impacts in our opening premise of a balanced approach, we are leaving ourselves a little open.  They need to be put in at this stage.  I strongly suggest that they be included.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTS2019011600002#D00700","speaker":"1259","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1547631000,"counter":700,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for her contribution and agree with her on the importance of health in dealing with this issue.  She mentioned the World Health Organization's guidelines.  She also said the Bill was too silent on the issue of health, but I point out that the EU regulation is not silent on the issue.  I would like to read for her section (11) of the citation of the regulation:<\/p><blockquote>The importance of health aspects needs to be recognised in relation to noise problems, and it is therefore important that those aspects be taken into consideration in a consistent manner at all airports when a decision is taken on noise abatement objectives, taking into account the existence of common Union rules in this area.  Therefore, health aspects should be assessed in accordance with Union legislation on the evaluation of noise effects.<\/blockquote> <p>It is recognised as a very important aspect of noise regulation.  As a result and of the fact that the purpose of the Bill is to make provision for implementation of EU Regulation No. 598\/2014 and keep strictly to it, I cannot accept the amendment as we have to abide by the regulation to the letter.  That is the legal advice we have received.  However, the issue is covered comprehensively by the regulation.  <\/p><p>The approach to aircraft noise mitigation set out in EU Regulation No. 598\/2014 is based entirely on the so-called balanced approach developed by the United Nations International Civil Aviation Organization.  It will ensure a consistent approach across Europe to mitigating aircraft noise.  The balanced approach process includes the setting of a noise abatement objective.  It will be a matter for the noise regulator as part of the process to set out the parameters to be met within that objective.  I am not proposing to dictate to the noise regulator what its noise abatement objective should include, but, for the reasons I have given to the Deputy, I am very limited in what I can concede by way of amendments if I am to stick to the advice given to me, including the advice of legal counsel.  I have endeavoured to do so as much as I can and, where possible, taken on board the proposals made by other Deputies.  When it comes to adding to or taking away provisions directly lifted from the EU regulation, I am simply not allowed to do so, but I think the Deputy will acknowledge that the health aspects are well covered in the regulation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTS2019011600002#E00300","speaker":"1213"},{"type":"speech","time":1547631000,"counter":701,"content":"<p>I cannot accept the Minister's reply on that issue.  On the one hand, he is saying he has to enact the regulation to the letter of the law and that because the issue is covered, the amendment is not really needed, but, on the other, the legislation specifies the cost-effectiveness of all of the measures.  It is repeated <i>ad nauseam<\/i>that in dealing with the issue the competent authority must pay attention to cost-effectiveness.  Why can he not pay similar attention to the health consequences if, as he says, they are covered by the regulation?  If it is not silent on them, as it is not, including the amendment in the legislation would not be a contradiction, particularly when the Minister has transferred other issues into the Bill.  It does not add up.  If we were to enact the legislation as it stands, it would not be balanced.  It is tilted as it pays deference to cost-effectiveness but not to health, something the Minister says is covered by the regulation.  If it is covered by the legislation, there is no problem, but, of course, we all know that there is a problem because the health consequences have not been treated adequately, particularly in the light of the more recent scientific research in that regard and the decibel ratings for planning permissions and other practices engaged in at the airport which already breaches them.  Unless it is centre stage, we are <i>de facto<\/i>diminishing the issue of health.  The Minister cannot just say that as it is covered, it is all right; it is not.  There is an imbalance and the issue has to be centre stage.<\/p><p>This is important because of adverse health effects among the exposed population.  Many individuals have to adapt their lives to cope with the noise at night, and vulnerable groups are more severely affected.  Therefore, we need to put what I propose in the definitions.

In addition to drawing the Minister's attention to communities in Fingal, I draw his attention to those in Tyrrelstown and Mulhuddart, and also those in Dublin West, which are on the western approach to the airport and suffer severely because of noise.  People can live with noise during the day but at night it is really important that some restrictions be placed on flights to ensure night sleep is not interfered with.  I live in Mulhuddart, where, because of noise at night, I noticed it is almost impossible to leave a bedroom window open in the summer.  I can only imagine the noise level closer to the airport.

The Minister talks about quality of life, but that is not health specifically.  Obviously health is an aspect of it.  However, because of the impact and the emphasis put on this question by the World Health Organization, WHO, because it is so important, we need to specify that we are not just talking about quality of life as something abstract or nice or an additional extra.  It is an integral part of people's right to health.  It has a severe impact on their mental health, their well-being and their physical health if they do not get enough sleep and if they are intruded upon negatively by noise.

Many of us do not believe that Fingal County Council is the appropriate authority to carry out this function.  We all believe it was chosen in a hurry because the Minister had left it too late to bring in a competent authority on noise regulation and as a result, the deadline was missed by the time he realised that the Irish Aviation Authority, IAA, would not be allowed to carry out the function because it failed the independence test.  However, I am surprised that Fingal County Council passed the independence test given that it is paid rates by the airport and relies on the airport for part of its rates.  It is high time that we move away from having bodies regulate entities when they rely on those same entities for their income.  It is the same with the IAA and safety regulation, although apparently legislation is being introduced to break up the IAA for that very reason.  The Minister might correct me if I am wrong.  <\/p><p>If it is not appropriate in the case of the IAA and civil aviation regulation, why should it be allowed in the case of Fingal County Council?  Many Deputies are of this opinion, as are the residents who do not have any confidence in Fingal County Council overseeing matters because it relies on the airport for funds.  It does not inspire confidence in anybody.  The thinking is very much that it was a rush job by the Minister, and an 11th hour decision taken on his behalf.  That is the very reason why it should be replaced with the Commissioner for Aviation Regulation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTS2019011600002#H00200","speaker":"1333"},{"type":"speech","time":1547631000,"counter":719,"content":"<p>Does the Minister wish to respond?

This is the section that deals with who should be the competent authority.  It is a key part of the legislation and this is probably the most substantial group of amendments before us.  The key job of transposing EU Regulation No. 598\/2014 is to establish a competent authority which will be appointed to set up the rules and regulations for dealing with the impact of aircraft noise in line with the balanced approach.  The authority in the European Union is very clear on what the basis of the body should be.  I reiterate it states:<\/p><blockquote>The competent authority responsible for adopting noise-related operating restrictions should be independent of any organisation involved in the airport&rsquo;s operation, air transport or air navigation service provision, or representing the interests thereof and of the residents living in the vicinity of the airport.  This should not be understood as requiring Member States to modify their administrative structures or decision-making procedures. <\/blockquote> <p>A couple of years after saying that the IAA would be the body which would carry out this function, the Minister has done a massive somersault and is now saying that it will not be the IAA, but will be Fingal County Council.  There are several different solutions proposed as to how we should deal with this.<\/p><p>The Minister thinks it should be Fingal County Council and we will address that point in a minute because there are alternatives.  The first point I want to make is that we have to see what Ireland is doing in the context of what other countries are doing.  The Minister's proposition to appoint Fingal County Council not only does not meet the requirement for independence, as outlined by Deputy Munster, but is completely at variance with what every single other jurisdiction in the European Union has done.  We know that eight member states are not required to bring this in because their airports are too small.  Another eight member states have designated the Civil Aviation Authority, the equivalent of the Irish Aviation Authority, IAA.  Those eight member states did not seem to have a problem with independence and that is the biggest group of other member states.  Five member states have designated a Government Department.  Two members states have designated multiple bodies, including a Government Department and a national agency.  Two member states have not completed it yet.  Three member states have designated one or more local, regional or federal authorities.  The stance Ireland has taken is utterly bizarre.  It is unheard of for a local authority to take on the national regulatory responsibility of a competent national authority.  <\/p><p> I will not labour the points made by Deputy Munster but the residents know, as does everybody, from dialogue with Fingal County Council that so much of the council's rate base and influence comes from the DAA that it impairs the council's independence and there is no question or doubt about that.  I have seen the Minister's responses on that, where he says it is not really 20% and is only 8% when all the income streams are taken in.  That is splitting hairs because it is quite obvious that the DAA is the biggest payer to the income of Fingal County Council.  The council granted the original permissions for the airport runway and so on, so it is safe to say that not only is it not independent but it could never even be perceived to be independent.  There is a huge problem with Fingal County Council.<\/p><p> I do not want to repeat the Minister's words back to him, but in answers to parliamentary questions over recent years, he told us that the IAA was the best show in town and all that good stuff, and he is now standing that on its head.  The reports that the Department gave us as to why it had to be Fingal County Council and why the other organisations were not suitable did not add up.  Nobody is suggesting the IAA but the Minister does not seem to have taken on board the game-changing recommendation of the Commission for Aviation Regulation, CAR.  That is the favoured choice of residents.  It is not their exclusive choice because the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, may also be appropriate but most groups would prefer the CAR as the alternative to Fingal because the goalposts have now moved with the decision to split the IAA and the division of the commercial and regulatory functions.<\/p><p> The State is now on the cusp of bringing forward other legislation to have one single regulator for aviation which is a highly specialist and technical area.  We could bring it all under the one remit and the Minister chose not to include aircraft noise, a key regulatory function, under that brief.  It does not make sense.  The only answer we got as to why it was not suitable was that they do not have the capacity at the moment.  It is recognised that Fingal does not have the capacity at the moment.  The EPA would not have the capacity for dealing with this.  It is a highly specialist area.  The reason it fits better coming in under the CAR, with its aviation expertise, is precisely because the people who regulate aviation are highly skilled technicians.  They are of a pay grade and a level of expertise that is not replicated elsewhere.  It is not replicated in the EPA and it is certainly not replicated in Fingal County Council.  Fianna F&aacute;il's dressed up version of Fingal County Council is still Fingal County Council.  The suggestion that the council would set up an aircraft noise regulation division is not sufficiently independent from Fingal County Council.<\/p><p>In addition, an area set up solely for airport noise regulation will not be sufficiently busy to attract and maintain the level of expertise necessary to support this type of venture, if my point is understood.  That is critical if it is just airport noise.  In this group of amendments one of the solutions is the Fianna F&aacute;il idea of Fingal County Council setting up an independent noise regulator.  It is important to state, first, that the perceived link with Fingal is still there as it is still under Fingal County Council.  An office to the side, sitting in Fingal but called the airport noise regulator, will not be working morning, noon and night.  It will not have a critical mass of work or enough work to sustain the level of expertise necessary to be enticed into this outfit.  The only arena where one could get that is in the CAR, and it is not there at present.  Indeed, it is nowhere now.  However, that is the natural home for it and we must be clear about that.  Most of the residents' groups favour this as the alternative.<\/p><p> There was openness to the idea of the EPA possibly being considered as well.  It is not hard and fast but in terms of aviation expertise, the EPA is not really at the races.  Residents are highly aggrieved at this situation.  The Minister reports in other replies to parliamentary questions that the EPA has said it is not up to the job.  That is not true.  Residents have gone to the trouble of getting freedom of information responses regarding the EPA and its involvement in this, and there has been no substantial dialogue with the EPA in terms of whether it might want this function.  It is not true to say, as has been said, that the EPA does not want the gig.  The records show that it has not been asked about the gig.  It is important to put that on the record.<\/p><p> It is also important to record that concern has been expressed about the fact that the IAA submission to the recent airport noise plan by Fingal County Council was a little too deferential to the existing planning restrictions linked to the new runway.  It made the point that it was concerned about the operating restrictions.  That is beyond its remit.  This should not be the basis of the concern.  The concern is about the best way forward for reducing the impact of noise, not the airport restricting operations even though there is a knock-on in that regard.<\/p><p> For all those reasons the CAR is the best fit.  That is entirely in line with what most of the other member states have done.  We are setting up a new regulatory authority.  Everything is changing.  The impact on climate change, for example, means aircraft regulation is something that will have to be taken a great deal more seriously, and the impact of noise is a key component of that.  Leaving it out does not make any sense.  The points as to why it should not be Fingal County Council have been well made.  As to what else, the CAR is the best fit simply because of the technical expertise aspect and that level on the food chain, as it were.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTS2019011600002#H00700","speaker":"1259","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1547631000,"counter":726,"content":"<p>Five amendments in this group are in my name and I am the joint proposer of others.  My amendments are related to my view and that of my party and the residents.  They are based on my party's legal advice that Fingal County Council should not be designated the competent body because it is not independent enough.  An alternative body with the required independence is needed.  The Minister and his advisers have got it wrong.  It is no shame to admit that, even at this stage.  On Second Stage many of us asked the Minister to take on board what people were saying and to return on this Stage with an amended version of the legislation which took that on board.  We were not making it up just for the sake of it.  There is a real sense that it does not have independence, and there should be recognition of that from the Minister and his officials.<\/p><p>The two proposals in this grouping for alternative bodies are the Commission for Aviation Regulation, CAR, and the EPA.  My preference is for the CAR but I am not hung up on that.  If the Minister or Department officials felt that the EPA was better from their point of view, I would take that advice.  During the debate on Second Stage, I spoke about the lack of independence and gave the ESB as example of true independence, where we have EirGrid, Electric Ireland and the ESB itself.  They all have separate independent boards with no mixed or overlapping functions.<br\/><br\/>What the Minister is proposing here is that the CEO of Fingal County Council - referred to as FCC in the Bill - will not be independent of the local authority itself.  That is a fact.  The Bill, as proposed, does not achieve functional separation between the competent authority and the local residents.  Deputy Clare Daly has gone through section 13 and the need for independence.  Article 3.2 goes on to provide that:<\/p><blockquote>The competent authorities shall be independent of any organisation which could be affected by noise-related action.  That independence may be achieved through a functional separation.<\/blockquote><p>That is open to challenge because what is proposed here does not have that functional separation.  In respect of my amendments, my proposal is to go for the CAR as the competent authority.  My amendment No. 4 is about interpretation and it inserts &quot;CAR&quot;.  My amendment No. 6, in section 2, again on interpretation, deletes &quot;FCC&quot;.  My amendment No. 7, in section 3 on the designation of the competent authority, replaces &quot;FCC&quot; with &quot;CAR&quot;.  My amendment No. 10, in section 3 on the designation of competent authority, deletes lines 10 to 38 on page 7 and lines 1 to 12 on page 8 because that section deals specifically with a relationship with a local authority.  The best thing to do, therefore, is to eliminate those lines completely if the CAR, or somebody else, is designated rather than Fingal County Council.

There is general agreement across the board, even from Fianna F&aacute;il in respect of what it is proposing.  There is no acceptance that this is independent enough.  Something has to change and I will certainly be hoping to achieve that between today and Report Stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTS2019011600002#K00200","speaker":"1301","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1547631000,"counter":728,"content":"<p>I will speak on my amendments in this group now as well.  It has been well flagged to the Minister, before Christmas in the debate that took place in the full D&aacute;il and in much of the correspondence that he would have received from residents who have studied this, that it is not appropriate that Fingal County Council would be responsible for monitoring and protecting residents in respect of noise.  It is not even the councillors, by the way, who would have any oversight as members elected by the residents.  It would be the CEO of Fingal County Council.<\/p> <p>  I will refer to some reasons for making this change, including the issue of expertise but also conflict of interest.  The reality is that the rates base upon which Fingal County Council is reliant immediately means that it is loathe to challenge any major developments in the airport in the way that would be potentially required to protect residents from noise.  The council is also reliant on development contributions and many of us who have been members of the council have seen that the airport is a major part of Fingal's overall development.  Nobody is saying that the airport should not develop but it is necessary to have some independent body involved which is not linked to its development.<\/p><p>In terms of expertise, the Minister has received correspondence from residents.  On 10 December, a presentation was made on the Dublin Airport noise action plan to the full membership of Fingal County Council, but that presentation did not even meet the requirements of the environmental noise directive.  It was meant to be a graphical presentation and include maps disclosing the areas where the noise limits were exceeded.  It is meant to show differences, the current position and the potential position if a new runway is built or an enhancement at the airport takes place, but none of that has been done.  Planning permission was given for the north runway and the construction contract awarded.  Therefore, at a minimum, one would expect the council to show difference maps and compare them with the existing position.  <\/p><p> The other issue is that noise levels increased dramatically between 2006 and 2016, but there was nothing in the plan to suggest Fingal County Council had done or was going to do anything about it.  It was very evident in the recent presentation that the council had taken quite a light touch regulation approach to noise issues at the airport.  On there being a conflict of interest, when the council grants planning permission to Aer Rianta, it receives &euro;21 million in development levies.  One can see, therefore, that it is implicated.  The authority that deals with noise regulation should be completely independent.  I am open on what that authority should be.  When I discussed the matter with some residents with whom I had been dealing, we felt the EPA would more be appropriate.  <\/p><p> On that subject, it was stated at previous meetings of this committee that the EPA would not be considered because it had not shown that it could step up to the plate.  It was also implied that it had indicated that it was not interested, which is completely untrue.  A resident made a FOI request to try to delve into this issue and iIt emerged that the EPA had not even been consulted.  No records showing that it had ever stated it was not interested were found in the trawl that took place.  Therefore, misinformation was given to this committee ruling out the EPA as a factor.  I can pass this information around if the Minister wants me to do so.  What was said was that discussions with individual members of staff had been checked and that they could not find any record.  All relevant persons in the EPA were asked if they had had any interaction on the issue and they had not.  Why, therefore, did somebody from the Department say they had?  It seems that residents are being given false information, for which the Minister should account.  <\/p><p> The Minister needs to listen.  Why would he not have the interests of residents at heart and appoint an independent body to regulate noise levels, rather than the planning authority which clearly has a conflict of interest and does not have the staff to do so?  I do not know if it wants to do so, but it would need to recruit a whole department.  I think it has enough on its plate in building housing during the worst housing crisis it has ever seen.  It seems that the EPA would be more appropriate, but I am open to the others mentioned in the other amendments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTS2019011600002#L00200","speaker":"1434","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1547631000,"counter":730,"content":"<p>I will speak to amendment No. 9 in my name which is included in this grouping.  <\/p> <p>  With the exception of Deputy Clare Daly, I have been the Member of the D&aacute;il who has been most vocal on the need to accelerate implementation of the EU regulation which was first requested of the Government almost four years ago.<\/p><p>I have repeatedly raised this issue with the Minister by way of parliamentary questions, priority questions, oral questions and written questions.  The manner in which he has handled the matter to date has contributed to the anxiety, fear and worry of the residents who need to be protected.  He has left us in a position where there is an urgent requirement at the 11th hour to have this EU regulation transposed onto the Irish Statute Book.  The Minister has even missed the timeline he set out last July and continues to miss every timeline he has set down.  He changes as he goes along.<\/p><p> In February 2018, the Minister first indicated that Fingal County Council would be made the competent authority.  I raised concerns then about the council's capacity and whether it would have the relevant expertise to ensure it would be independent and address the concerns of neighbours and residents, while at the same time allowing the airport to develop and grow.  We cannot ignore that the airport directly employs 20,000 people and indirectly employs a further 45,000 people.  It is, therefore, of great strategic importance not just to the local economy and the livelihoods of many people living in close proximity to it but also to the economy as a whole.  We are an island nation and given the serious uncertainties arising from Brexit, we need to realise how important a role Dublin Airport plays.<\/p><p> As I said, we raised the issue of the expertise as opposed to independence of Fingal County Council.  If we were to go down the route that other Deputies are suggesting, we would decide that Fingal County Council and every other county council could not adjudicate planning applications independently or fairly because all planning applications have the potential to deliver returns by way of development levies or commercial rates if the building or development in question is allowed to progress.  We are effectively saying that every decision a council will ever take could be compromised because it would have a financial net benefit to the local authority.<\/p><p> I put forward my amendment in conjunction with my colleague who represents the area to ensure there is independence.  One of the reasons given for designating Fingal County Council as the competent authority as opposed to other entities such as the Commissioner for Aviation Regulation, CAR, and the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, was the council's capacity to build a Chinese wall and have a dedicated, independent body operating within the organisation.  For this reason, we have tabled specific amendments on this matter to ensure there is independence.<\/p><p> I ask the Minister to indicate what will be done to ensure the necessary expertise and capabilities will be acquired, sourced or recruited for Fingal County Council.<\/p><p>What structure does he envisage within Fingal County Council if this legislation is passed?  Time is of the essence in this matter and that is the fault of the Minister and the Government rather than anyone on this side of the room.  We have a responsibility to ensure that a robust and independent regulatory regime is put in place to facilitate the sustainable growth of a major strategic economic hub on which tens of thousands of people within the constituency in which the airport is located and much further afield depend for their livelihood and income.  We depend on the airport to grow in order to facilitate further connectivity and our tourism industry.  How does the Minister propose to ensure that Fingal County Council will have an independent unit which will be adequately staffed by employees with the necessary expertise and capabilities to ensure that residents' concerns will be dealt with in a balanced manner as stipulated in the EU regulation?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTS2019011600002#M00200","speaker":"1250","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1547631000,"counter":733,"content":"<p>I will ask the Minister to respond and then revert to members who wish to address other amendments.

It is a small economic regulatory body responsible for determining the maximum level of charges which may be charged at Dublin Airport.  It has no expertise or statutory remit in regard to environmental noise, environmental protection or planning and development, all of which issues are critical elements of the Bill.  Furthermore, it has no current capacity to or experience of running the type of extensive public consultations required by regulation 598.  Importantly, it does not have the organisational capacity to absorb a substantive new function within a relatively short timeframe.  It is a small economic regulator with some additional consumer protection functions and has approximately 20 staff.  It simply is not currently equipped to undertake the role of noise regulator within any reasonable timeframe.<\/p> <p>  The Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, was also considered as an option.  It has a statutory remit in regard to environmental protection.  It has an oversight role in terms of ensuring compliance by State bodies under the environmental noise directive in respect of noise maps and noise action plans produced by local authorities.  It is the considered view that the regulatory requirements under regulation 598 are very different to the licensing, audit and inspection role of the EPA.  The role under regulation 598 would represent a step change from what it is currently set up to do.<\/p> <p>  On Second Stage I addressed the decision to appoint Fingal County Council to this role and outlined the reasons I believe the council is the best fit.  I will briefly reiterate those points for clarity.  There is significant overlap between regulation 598, the planning process and environmental protection requirements.  In that respect, Fingal County Council is well suited to the job in light of its extensive experience in planning and development, land use planning and management, appropriate assessment, environmental impact assessment and managing large public consultations.<\/p><p>Providing the council with additional legal powers to regulate noise at Dublin Airport builds on its functions relating to noise under the environmental noise directive, END, and the planning code generally.  As will be discussed further under section 5 of the Bill, Fingal County Council will impose a levy on the DAA to cover the costs of carrying out its functions under this Act.  This will allow the council to bring in the expertise necessary to make evidence-based regulatory decisions on the most appropriate measures to be imposed at the airport.  It will also allow it to build upon its in-house capacity.  The decision of the noise regulator will be open and transport, subject to appeal and judicial review.  I am satisfied that the proposal on the implementation of EU Regulation No. 598\/2014 is wholly aligned with the long established multifunctional role played by all local authorities and, in my view, Fingal County Council is the most suitable body to take on this role.<\/p><p> I will answer the question posed by Deputy Troy because it took a slightly different line than seeking to have a different regulator.  I understand the Deputy is concerned to make sure the regulatory process is robust, rigorous and immune from any inappropriate outside influence.  I share his concern and recognise that he has consistently pursued this objective.  In some ways, he has bane of my life for the past 18 months.  The Deputy can be assured that I posed the same questions to my officials.  The matter has been subjected to serious and rigorous examination, including legal examination.  The conclusion is that the current provisions in the Bill are sound and meet the requirements the Deputy addressed.<\/p><p> Fingal County Council will establish a new, well resourced and dedicated aircraft noise regulation office within the executive branch, which will include the appropriate noise expertise sought by the Deputy.  The office will be headed at a senior level by a director of services with all of the appropriate arrangements to ensure decisions are taken fully in accordance with the law, as happens in planning and development, for example.  The Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government recently gave sanction to Fingal County Council to take on up to nine permanent staff for its new office.  I am confident that the council will have all of the tools at its disposal to reach a decision in line with EU Regulation No. 598\/2014.  The legislation sets out the legal framework that the noise regulator will need to work to.  It is a matter for Fingal County Council to determine how best to administer that function.<\/p><p> I will respond to members' specific questions which share a common theme.  While I do not want to repeat myself, I am happy to do so.  Deputy Munster said that Fingal County Council is not independent and she seemed to indicate that the IAA was the preferred and original choice.  She also claimed that this has been a rushed job.  That is a fair comment in many ways.  We are absolutely satisfied that Fingal County Council will be independent.  We have examined the independence of the council.  I understand Dublin Airport accounts for 7% of its income and we are perfectly happy with that percentage.  That decision or verdict of independence is supported by the Government's legal adviser, namely, the Attorney General.  I remind members of one important fact.<\/p><p>It was the Attorney General's office that decided that the IAA was not independent.  That was the problem.  Presumably using the same criteria, which it obviously has, to judge the independence of the IAA and Fingal County Council, it has decided that the council is independent.  I cannot take higher or more compelling advice.  The Attorney General's legal advice is something of which we have to take heed.  Were we to defy it in any way, members would be the first people to come to me and say doing so was reckless.  The Attorney General has said that Fingal County Council is independent.  Even Opposition Members must consider that a serious point.<\/p><p> Deputy Munster said this was a rushed job.  I accept fully the criticism that it has taken too long.  I will put my hands up - the problems involved were not necessarily of my making, but I take responsibility for them.  That this has taken too long has been the result of various legal advices and other matters.  However, having been criticised for two and a half years for this taking too long and, after accepting that perfectly legitimate criticism and making haste in response, it is difficult to now be told it is a rushed job.  We are in haste and we want to get this Bill through quickly.  We are late.  It is important for many reasons that the Bill be expedited.  I am grateful to the committee members for at least assisting in that and giving plenty of time for a valuable debate on the merits of whichever body they believe would best be the competent authority.<\/p><p> I have probably dealt with the issue of independence that Deputy Daly raised, although I am sure she does not agree with me.  She referred to our \"somersault\".  It was good rhetoric, but what we have done is make a decision on the back of legal advice that the IAA was not the right body and then moved on to what we now believe is a very good body to do this work.  We are accepting the legal advice that was given in that regard.<\/p><p> The Deputy referred to EU member states.  Ireland is in line with other member states in its choice of competent authority.  Member states are notable for the diversity of their competent authorities.  I can see no formula, template or common theme.  There are five or six categories from which such authorities have been chosen.  The Deputy is correct in much of what she said.  For example, yet to designate are Belgium and Spain.  They will do so shortly, but we do not know which way they will go.  France and Romania have designated multiple bodies.  A government department has been designated by Austria, Greece, Hungary, Luxembourg and the Netherlands.  The aviation authority has been designated by the Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, Italy, Latvia, Poland, Portugal and Sweden.  Probably because the regulation is qualified by the numbers involved, it does not apply to Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Estonia, Lithuania, Malta, Slovakia and Slovenia.  In common with us, Germany and the UK have designated local or regional authorities, so we are not an outrider completely.  There is great variety.  I do not know enough about the situation to know why every country chose particular bodies, but I expect those countries were considering the same criteria as us.  Their various bodies have different levels of independence.  To say that we are on our own is not true.  Germany and the UK have made similar decisions.<\/p><p>The rate base is 7% of Fingal's income.  Deputies Daly and Coppinger talked about the Environmental Protection Agency.  The EPA was consulted.  I do not know about freedom of information data.  It is useful to have it but the agency was consulted.  I can assure Deputies of that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTS2019011600002#O00700","speaker":"1213","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1547631000,"counter":742,"content":"<p>Is the Minister saying the agency was consulted?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTS2019011600002#R00200","speaker":"1434"},{"type":"speech","time":1547631000,"counter":743,"content":"<p>It was.

It is important that we should get that from the office that rejected the proposal relating to the Irish Aviation Authority.<\/p> <p>  There is a common theme running through much of what people have said to the effect that I should take on board what people are saying.  I wish to say one thing that is important.  I absolutely commend Deputies Daly, Troy, Coppinger and Munster for what they are doing in representing the residents.  That is a useful and effective democratic procedure.  Undoubtedly what they have said has had an effect on the Bill.  However, I do not accept in any sense the criticism that I have ignored local residents.  My guess is that no Minister would have met more local residents.  I have not met them all - there are many groups - but I have met a vast number of residents from the areas involved as well as various delegations that Deputies have asked me to meet.  These are not people in my constituency but from north Dublin.  I welcome that and I have taken those views on board.<\/p> <p>  I have asked the DAA in various circumstances to meet these people and to take into account various points of view.  I believe it is the right thing to do.  It has taken some time and it has been useful but it is what a Minister ought to do and it is reflected in the Bill.  The points of view of residents are paramount and have to be taken into account.  There must be a balanced approach of course.  The idea that this has been done in any way regardless of their views or the real fears, difficulties and problems this may entail for them is not true.  They have had a welcome audience.  I have no wish to make this into some sort of pious statement.  There may be one or two whom I have not met but I have met a great many.  I have met several delegations and I have not been reluctant to meet them at all.  I hope that is reflected in everything I have been saying and in the Bill.

Let us look back on the reasons the IAA was not permitted.  It was because the authority failed the independence test.<\/p><p>I had asked the Minister to confirm whether legislation was being drawn up to break up the IAA.  I refer to the independence of the IAA in safety regulation.  If it is not appropriate in the case of the IAA and civil aviation regulation, why should it be allowed in the case of Fingal County Council and noise regulation?  The Minister also said that the CAR would not be equipped to take on the role of regulator and that there was no expertise.  Those same things, however, could be said of Fingal County Council.  Returning to the making of the decision, it was rushed into because of the circumstances.  It was an 11th hour decision to appoint Fingal County Council, but it also does not have the required in-house expertise.  At an earlier meeting, one of the Minister's colleagues mentioned about having to seek and bring in outside expertise.  It was also mentioned that nine permanent staff would have to be recruited to deal with this.<\/p><p> The other issue I want to take up also goes back to independence being the key.  People are looking for that and for transparency in decision-making right across the board.  That is all that communities are looking for.  They are looking for safeguards so that they can feel confident that their issues and concerns about health and well-being will all be considered independently and in a very transparent way.  The Minister referred to 7% of the income from Fingal County Council.  That is not small change in respect of the budget.  It is a substantial part of the budget of a council of the size of Fingal and yet it is being brushed off as something and nothing, as if it were spare change.  The key aspect here is independence and people do not have confidence that Fingal County Council has the required ability, expertise or, in particular, independence in decision-making.  Therein lies the problem.  There is no other reason for choosing Fingal County Council than the Minister getting into a tizzy when he realised the IAA was not suitable.  It was the 11th hour and he went with it.

If we go onto the EPA website now, <i>www.epa.ie<\/i>, and then click into EPAMaps, it can be seen that in Tyrrelstown, which I looked up because it is a community very near me, the noise level during the day is 55 to 59 decibels.  It is in that contour.  The World Health Organization, WHO, recommendation is actually 45 decibels, so that is exceeding it.  Hollywoodrath, the new estate that people are going to be moving into very shortly and which councillors saw fit to put on the fringe of the airport with its associated noise level, already has a noise level of 60 to 64 decibels during the day.  Again, the WHO recommendation is 45 decibels.  At night, Tyrrelstown's noise level is between 50 to 54 decibels when the WHO recommends a level of 40 decibels.  I am giving those data because I could not have got them anywhere else except the EPA.  It seems bizarre that anyone could speak at a Joint Committee on Transport, Tourism and Sport and state that the EPA could not be considered to do this while it seems well positioned to do it, with extra resources and expertise.  That was the only way I could get the information to which I referred.<\/p><p>On the Minister stating that the EPA was consulted, this is about accountability in public life.  At a meeting in October, Mr. Gallagher, who is present, stated that a few existing agencies were looked at, including the EPA, which was quickly ruled out by its line Department and the agency.  He continued by stating that he supposed that was because of its inability to step up to the plate.

It may be shocking for people but it is not surprising in the context that we know the Minister and the Cabinet made the decision to appoint Fingal County Council prior to the enactment of this legislation.  It is a matter we have discussed before.  I have put it to the Minister that designating Fingal County Council as the competent authority, in advance of the Oireachtas approving it, is a pretty dodgy course of action to take, particularly when he does not have a plan B.<\/p> <p>  The simple fact of the matter is that nobody agrees with the Minister&rsquo;s proposition to designate Fingal County Council as the competent authority for noise regulation in the airport.  Fianna F&aacute;il&rsquo;s attitude is a bit of a fudge.  Nobody has given the Minister everything he wants in terms of this.  The idea the recruitment for a unit has been sanctioned is not surprising.  What is more shocking about it is the level at which the Minister has pitched the recruitment grades.  It shows a total lack of understanding of what is necessary in terms of the technical expertise and ability of the people who will form the basis of this competent authority.<\/p> <p>  When I referred to a somersault earlier, the Minister replied that while that may be nice political rhetoric, it did not mean anything.  I put it to the Minister that it means quite a lot because it goes to the heart of the credibility of the information the Minister and his Department have given the committee and D&aacute;il over the past several years.  The Minister claimed he had taken this course of action because of legal advice.  Two years ago, having met the Attorney General who was a week away from finalising the seventh and hopefully last draft of the regulations, the Minister told me that there was broad agreement that the Irish Aviation Authority was best positioned to take on this role and to do it to the highest standard of professional competence.  He said it had a strong and internationally verified track record in the area of aviation security and inspection, functions for which it already had legal responsibility.  He also said making it responsible for noise regulation made sense.<\/p><p>That was discussed by the committee.  The previous Attorney General stated that the Irish Aviation Authority, IAA, is best placed to deal with this issue.  It is a bit like the point regarding the EPA and the freedom of information request made by a resident.  It gets to the accuracy of the information that is given.  At the heart of this matter is deciding when we can believe the Minister and when we cannot.  If some of the information which we have been given is easily contradictable, how can we accept anything we are told?  Which answer should be accepted?  That is at the heart of this issue.<\/p><p> The Minister stated that he has met many residents.  Obviously, we appreciate the meetings he attended with residents but we are not raising the issue just to kowtow to residents.  Many people in the communities we represent depend on the airport for their livelihood.  Some very capable people have given their professional as well as residential input on the arguments and the merits of the proposition before us.  It is not grandstanding.  Nobody agrees with the way in which the Government has set this up in terms of Fingal County Council being the competent authority.   The points made by Deputy Brendan Ryan will come back to haunt the Minister.  The Minister cannot demonstrate a functional separation and that will be open to legal challenge.  Even the proposed staffing levels serve to strengthen any potential legal challenge.  We are digging an enormous hole for ourselves in terms of how it is proposed that this will be done.<\/p><p> In response to queries on why other organisations were not selected, the Minister read to us the notes in that regard which we were given a couple of months ago.  We read those notes some time ago and did not agree with them.  The points made in that have been reflected upon by members of the affected communities as well as by Oireachtas Members.  The key point in regard to the Commission for Aviation Regulation, CAR, is exactly the point that has changed.  All the way along, everybody agreed the IAA is best placed in terms of aviation regulation.  At the 11th hour, the Government decided there might be a problem in terms of independence, so the IAA was axed from consideration.  That is where we were.  I referred the Minister to the level of expertise within the IAA.  It still has that expertise but the game changer is that it is being moved and split and the regulatory functions for aviation will be held by a new aviation regulator.  That is the key issue but the Minister did not address it.  The 2017 annual report of the IAA confirms that this idea was being looked at.  In the report the IAA pledged to work with the Department throughout 2018 to make this aviation regulatory function a reality.  On the previous occasion I raised it with the Minister, he assured me that it is well under way.  If it is not progressing quickly enough, that is not the fault of the Opposition or the people who will live with this decision for decades to come.  The process was under way but the Minister has not reflected that in the argument.<\/p><p> I agree that the EPA would be a better fit for the role than Fingal County Council as it is responsible for mapping noise, but it does not have any aviation expertise in terms of taking the balanced approach necessary in tackling the sources of noise.  The CAR would be better placed as regulator because it has expertise in all of the aviation rules and procedures except noise.  The Minister should not rule it out because it does not have noise expertise and then justify the selection of Fingal County Council by reference to its using the levies it will receive from the Dublin Airport Authority, DAA, to acquire the necessary expertise.  The proposed staffing arrangements will not provide the necessary expertise.  I do not know why nine people are needed at lower grades.  Rather, a couple of highly skilled people at far more technical grades are required.<\/p><p> There is a real problem here.  We must cut to the chase.  It comes down to Fianna F&aacute;il.  Deputy Troy is correct.  He has consistently raised this issue with the Government in recent years, pointing out that the regulation must be implemented and why Fingal County Council is not suitable to be responsible for that implementation.<\/p><p>What Fianna F&aacute;il is proposing will not provide adequate protection.  It is not functionally separate enough.  I know that is what Deputy Troy is attempting to do, but even if the function of separation were there, it would not be sufficient.  There is not sufficient work in a stand-alone capacity for nine people, and certainly not at that level.  Much of the time they would not have anything to do.  It fits in more with aviation in that it is not a nine to five, 365 day a year briefing for this role, so if it were to be set up in that way, there would not be sufficient meat, as it were, to attract people of sufficient capabilities.  That would be a real problem.<\/p><p> The Minister did not answer the point about the other countries because he repeated back to me the points I had made, thus avoiding the principal point that no other jurisdiction has brought it in the way that we have.  Britain and Germany have not brought it in the way that we have.  What they have is either a local or a regional authority being set up, and let us face the fact that a German regional authority is bigger than Fingal County Council.  In each and every case, however, the Minister for transport of various state departments is also involved in the process and is part of the competent authority.  There is not one local authority on its own.  Therefore, no Administration has brought it in the same way that Ireland has and that point has not been answered yet.<\/p><p> We are looking for information and concrete answers to questions that are being raised here.  It is not just that we are representing the residents' views or providing rhetoric.  We are not getting the proper and accurate answers on this and it is not our fault that the rush is on now because the preparation was inadequate to begin with.  We are in a difficult situation and this stage of the process can be difficult for people to understand because there are not many votes and maybe we need to explain how that works because it is a bit confusing.  We are trying to move the debate on because the general points have been well articulated.  Most members do not agree with Fingal County Council and nobody outside of the Minister and presumably Fine Gael agrees with what the Minister is doing.  If that is accepted, then the alternative has to be looked at and the Minister has not listened to that.

We need that as an economic driver of this country.  Unfortunately we are backed into a corner now.  This is time-sensitive, and the reason it is time-sensitive is because of the procrastination by the Minister over the last two years.  We want to take this Bill and improve it.  That is why we have put forward amendments in that regard.  Listening to the Minister's reply in the last few minutes I have concerns about the level of expertise of the staff members that have been sanctioned by the Department.  Quite frankly it does not matter to me whether the Minister's Department sanctioned them or the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment did.  The Minister is the person responsible for this piece of legislation.<\/p> <p>  I acknowledge that these members of staff have been sanctioned.  That is fine.  They have not been recruited.  However, I am concerned with the grade of staff that is being sanctioned.  In my initial contribution I asked the Minister to outline clearly how we could have confidence that the staff that would be made responsible for conducting and implementing this regulation would have the necessary expertise and qualifications.  The Minister is talking about planners and engineers.  I have concerns about that and I hope the Minister can clarify that.<\/p> <p>  It is also worth noting, and it has not been acknowledged by the Minister or indeed by any speaker, that there is an appeals mechanism here.  The appeals mechanism is An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  Ultimately Fingal County Council is not going to be the final decision-maker.  There will be an appeals mechanism, that is, An Bord Plean&aacute;la, and a further appeals mechanism by way of judicial review.  We do not want to have to go that far.  We reluctantly acknowledge given the work that has been done in relation to Fingal County Council, that independence can be established by creating a body within Fingal County Council by creating a directorate there which is not answerable to anybody else, which can act independently and which must have the required expertise, skill and knowledge to ensure that this EU regulation is implemented to the letter of the law.<\/p><p>The director would also ensure a balanced approach, that the residents&rsquo; concerns were addressed and that noise mitigation measures were implemented, while at the same time enabling the airport to grow and develop.  It is now at capacity and if we push this down the line, we will put its further development and jobs in the region at risk.  That is why we have proposed the amendments in the way we have and I stand over them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTS2019011600002#Y00700","speaker":"1250","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1547631000,"counter":813,"content":"<p>Deputy Troy has just said the director of services appointed would be independent.

That the staff have been sanctioned by the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government really enforces the argument we are making in respect of total interdependency and the inappropriate nature of the council in being the competent authority and the planning authority.  It is the body that comes within the budget of the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government.  The levels and pay grades announced are completely out of kilter with those in the rest of the area of aviation regulation, for example.  The pay grades are nothing like those within an IAA or CAR equivalent.  I refer to the high-level technical expertise needed in this area.  It shows a misconception or lack of understanding and is more prevalent in the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government than the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport because, when we had briefings, the staff who attended from the Department responsible for the environment were saying the council could, of course, do as described, that it would receive a planning consideration and go to the Department responsible for roads or water services to get advice and factor it in.  It demonstrates a complete lack of understanding of the point to state a competent authority has the right, when the planning authority goes to it, to state, \"Thus far and no further.\"  The competent authority must be obeyed.  That the authority can be duly ignored by the planning system represents an unhealthy influence on the part of the Department responsible for the environment.  It actually undermines what should be the independent role of a noise regulator in that regard.  It is actually very unhelpful.<\/p> <p>  My other point is on the need.  It is the case that we need a competent authority.  That is absolutely true and we have long been campaigning to try to have one.  How time-sensitive is it and what would be the impact?  Who will suffer because of the delay?  The DAA, for example, is on record as stating it does not mind at all who the competent authority is as long as we get our act together and get the legislation through, thus providing for more clarity.  What we are saying strongly is that we all want to see legislation and see this process through, but we want to see it being set up on the right basis in order that we can do both.<\/p> <p>  A reply I received to a parliamentary question to the Minister in December referred to the plans for the new commission for aviation regulation.  It indicated that work was well under way.  It referred to a high-level project management board, to much due diligence work being done and to numerous working groups.<\/p><p>Discussions had begun with the trade union F&oacute;rsa.  It involved complex competencies but the Minister was looking at it.  There were a number of stages to be done but it was under way.  If we are doing the job we should be doing it right.  We need to do it right.  I appeal to Fianna F&aacute;il.  We can set up a competent authority, but let us set it up in the flipping right way because this is going to be in place for years to come.  That is important.  The Minister has not really addressed those points at all.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTS2019011600002#Z00500","speaker":"1259","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1547631000,"counter":818,"content":"<p>Finishing up on the issue of where we all stand, my impression before Christmas was that all parties barring Fine Gael were putting it to the Minister that Fingal County Council was not appropriate, that it was important to have complete independence, and that we had to be honest with residents.  That does not now seem to be the case because if Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael vote for the Bill as it stands, the council will be the competent authority.  We have to be upfront with people that this is what is happening.  I hope that will change before Report Stage as a result of dialogue with the residents, but that is where it stands now.<\/p> <p>  Amendment No. 9, which Deputy Troy just mentioned, provides that the director of the aircraft noise regulator section of the council shall not be subject to the direction of any other person.  First, as Deputy Munster has said, the CEO is the top person in the council.  Not only that, but page 7 of the legislation itself makes it absolutely and abundantly clear that the \"the functions of the competent authority [...] shall be performed by the chief executive\".  The chief executive of the council will over-ride any other section in the council so Deputy Troy's amendment will do nothing to protect the regulator's independence.<\/p> <p>  On the issue of time, we absolutely agree that we do not want to delay necessary development but no matter whether one is recruiting for the council, the EPA or the Commission for Aviation Regulation, it takes the same amount of time so that argument is completely redundant.  The people with the necessary skills will need to be found regardless of which body is made the competent authority.  <\/p> <p>  Obviously Deputy Troy is the spokesperson for the biggest Opposition party and he has been doing the running all along, but there is no point doing the running and then falling back at the time when one is needed, that is, at the finish line.

I do not mind if the Deputy wants to go over the old coals of this long saga time and time again, that is up to her, but she will get the same responses.  Those same responses are the same reasons there has been a delay and I will give those responses every time she asks the same question.  That is fine.  People should be reminded of the difficulties we have faced but the reasons for them will be consistent.<\/p> <p>  I was asked if the delay is time sensitive and of course it is.  We want to resolve the uncertainty that exists.  The Deputy is representing a large number of residents here today, some of whom are in the Public Gallery, and they are welcome, but we want to make sure that the difficulties and uncertainties which they face and are living through, and I apologise for the delays, are ended.  It is time sensitive and those residents should know exactly what the consequences of what we are doing will be for them and we are determined to do that.  There is a lot in this directive which is balanced and in which those residents should find reassurance.  There is no noise regulator there at all at the moment.<\/p> <p>  I wish to address what Deputy Troy said.  His amendment looks for a robust body and his concern for independence is one which we share.  I do not envisage any great difficulty with having a chief executive in that situation because of the safeguards which exist.  It would be extraordinary if the chief executive were to do anything to compromise the independence because of the transparency of the process.  That would obviously emerge immediately and the safeguards which are there in the appeals mechanism which we have already mentioned, the commitment to public consultation through the appeals and noise regulation process and the judicial review to which we referred are adequate safeguards to make sure the transparency and independence is there.  <\/p> <p>  I also wish to assure Deputy Troy that resources and expertise will be brought to bear and, if there are mistakes, the appeal process will catch them.  This is a very thorough process.<\/p><p>It is a long and arduous process and people will be complaining for a long time to come.  An Bord Plean&aacute;la has 18 weeks yet and there are four weeks for appeals, which is to protect residents and the consumer.  The length of time to make sure the process is transparent and thorough is built into the legislation.  That is why it is there.  It is irritating.  We have so many cases of An Bord Plean&aacute;la annoying people because of delays in its decisions but the flip side of that is that the public and all sorts of stakeholders are protected by this and everything is taken into account.  I do not think anybody needs to fear that the process is not transparent and full.  It will be very thorough and forensic.  <\/p><p> It provides for a new regulatory regime to assess, monitor and enforce noise management at Dublin Airport.  We have had various suggestions about the competent authority here today.  People have suggested the EPA; the Commission for Aviation Regulation, CAR; and the Irish Aviation Authority, IAA, in a post-split situation.  All of them have a bit to offer and all of them have merit but on balance, I am adamant that the best choice is Fingal.  I do not dispute that everything that has been said here today has merit but it is a bit more nuanced.  Fingal has a great deal of expertise.  Overall, it has greater expertise and there is a better case for it than there is for the others.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTS2019011600002#BB00400","speaker":"1213","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1547631000,"counter":825,"content":"<p>Does Deputy Clare Daly wish to comment?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTS2019011600002#CC00200","speaker":"1329"},{"type":"speech","time":1547631000,"counter":826,"content":"<p>The Minister made the point that if one asks the same question, one will get the same answer but the problem is that we have been asking some of the same questions and have got either no answer or contradictory answers.

Which one is the right answer when at various times, the Minister have given two diametrically opposed answers to the same question?  The point I made about the Minister referring to past information referred to his critique of the other agencies that might act as a competent authority and the briefing from his Department in November 2018 that he rehashed for us today when he dealt with points and dismissed the CER using the same line he took in November but where he failed to address the question he was being asked.

The definitions in the Bill make reference to material from the European Parliament and Council in 2015.  The amendment recognises the fact that we are now in 2019 and there is further regulation in this area.  The Minister might not be able to give us the advice he received but we can seek our own advice on the matter.  Is the Minister telling me that no other jurisdiction in the European Union has incorporated these guidelines in legislation or regulation?  I doubt that no country has done so.  Has the Minister examined the way in which the directive has been implemented in each jurisdiction?  The difficulty is that the Minister stated that his legal advice indicates that, for example, the Irish Aviation Authority may not be installed as regulator, but we know that eight member states have their equivalent of the IAA as the competent authority and the world has not caved in.<\/p><p>They have been allowed to do so as sovereign states within the EU.  The same argument applies in regard to the amendment.  Can the Minister give us that assurance which nobody else has?  I suspect that he cannot and we will have to examine it ourselves in order to find out.  I would be very surprised if we do not find it because the Bill goes beyond dealing with the 2002 directive by making reference to 2015 decisions.  We are asking that it take account of the 2018 guidelines.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTS2019011600002#TT01300","speaker":"1259","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1547631000,"counter":977,"content":"<p>We all want to achieve the optimum standard of noise regulation.

When we made the point this morning, the Minister said that health is covered in the regulation anyway so there is no need for it and that was his first argument.  The Minister's other argument was that he will not add it in as part of this at this stage.  Those two points are, in part, contradictory.<\/p> <p>  It also comes back to the point I made earlier about cost-effectiveness.  For example, under the process of aircraft noise regulation, the Bill states, \"the competent authority shall ensure ... the Balanced Approach\" and it goes on, and takes into account the likely cost-effectiveness of the measure.  The Bill later states that the following combination of measures must be considered with a view to what is the most cost-effective.  All of these amendments are simply seeking to ensure that the impact on health is also factored into the considerations when the competent authority is adjudicating and implementing the balanced approach.  It is not tying their hands.  It is just saying they must be mindful in assessing whatever approach they adopt to include health as a consideration.<\/p> <p>  The Minister said he is going to come back in the context of Deputy Troy's amendment and the guidelines and maybe we can factor something in around that.  The point here, for all of these amendments, is we cannot have this Bill without any reference to health specified in it or any reference in it to the modern guidelines and best scientific advice, because the impetus behind this regulation is to deal with and restrict aviation practices and the noise they create to benefit the health of residents.  The idea that we could not put that somewhere in the Bill is mad.  I am not going to drone through the pages of other criteria that the competent authority has to take into account but it does not refer to health.

There are a whole number of different amendments in this and the health impact assessment is an add-in, something different, and it would obviously put a more considerable burden, as it were, on the competent authority in evaluating these measures.  I do not have a problem with that because, if they were really doing their job properly, carrying out an impact assessment from a health perspective, something we do not do enough in this country, would be precisely the type of impact assessment that should be done.  We are all used to environmental impact assessments but we are not so used to health impact assessments.  I realise that is raising the bar but that is appropriate in the context of this legislation, although I realise I am pushing the boundary on that.  I will park that for now, with the right to re-enter it, but, having genuinely said that, I do not accept what the Minister says about the other points on health.  We have been here for in the region of four hours, so maybe I am just not getting it.  On one hand, we are being told we cannot add something, then the Minister is reading something which specifies health aspects, then saying nowhere in our legislation is there a reference to health considerations but is then saying that he cannot take away or add anything.<\/p><p>Obviously, the Minister has taken it away because health is not mentioned anywhere in the Bill.  If it is so much an integral part of the regulation, which it clearly is, there is no impediment to specifying it in some format and I have not heard any good reason for not doing so.  I would like to explore the idea of a health impact assessment and I reserve the right to introduce an amendment on that.  The Department is correct, however, that that would be pushing it.  I do not have it in the definitions either and I would need to have it in there.  While that is a whole new arena, mentioning health is not.  It is much more straightforward.

The legislation states only the airport authority may, by notice in writing given to the competent authority, request the competent authority to assess a noise issue.  I am looking to ensure the airport authority or any organisation or individual impacted on by airport noise would be able to approach the competent authority because as of now only the airport authority is allowed to initiate the process under EU Regulation No. 598.  The problem concerns the criteria.  On the one hand, the DAA may do so at its discretion.  That has to be changed.  What does &quot;may at its discretion mean&quot;?  What is the threshold?  What if the DAA decides not to go to the competent authority?  Who would stop it in that regard?  Why does the DAA have control over whether it should do so?  Should it not be mandatory?

This legislation is about how the noise regulator does its job.  The Minister asks how the noise regulator would know whether there is an impact from noise.  At the moment, the Bill provides that the noise regulator can only intervene when the DAA goes to it.  There is no facility for a resident to do so.  What happens if there is a change to aircraft noise testing?  I live in River Valley and planes keep me awake at night.  There is no mechanism to address this because the matter falls outside the review that takes place every couple of years and the planning application.  I feel I am being negatively impacted by noise.  As this is specified, there is no route for me to go to the competent authority because the role of the competent authority is only to assess applications that come from the DAA, not from residents.

Again, this is partially linked to the last amendment we dealt with a minute ago.

I am not sure if the Bill is doing what I thought it was doing.  To be honest, I found it hard to negotiate what was being said in it.  It appeared to me that it was providing an out.

It is suggested a measure would be deferred if not practical to implement.  How can we include a provision that stops the clause being used to delay and frustrate the implementation of a noise-mitigation measure?  I am seeking to include a provision meaning there cannot be a delay for ridiculous reasons, for example.  I was not entirely happy with my amendment.  I proposed the insertion of \"if immediate implementation is not possible\".  At all times we should be trying to have whatever decision the competent authority makes implemented immediately.  I am worried about a reference in the legislation to an ability to defer so I am trying to include something to cushion it by stating the only reason one might defer is if immediate implementation is not possible.  I did not know the correct technical term, or whether it should be \"possible\" or \"practicable\".  I am not sure but the amendments are trying to avoid what I describe.  I am not sure whether my amendments succeed or whether the Minister has others that might address the issue.

Obviously, the authority should have power where a measure requires a lead-in period but Deputy Brendan Ryan's point in this regard is exactly right in that if we are giving it the power of deferral, we have to include some caveats; otherwise it should not be given the power to defer because its job is supposed to be implementing noise-mitigation measures.  The Minister is the one who introduced the concept of deferring.  We are just trying to add safeguards, in a common-sense way.
